AB  - The development of fetal behaviour and of fetal behavioural states (FBS) has been well defined in preterm and term fetuses. However, FBS have not yet been studied after term, although this is a potentially very dangerous period and clinical management is controversial. We investigated fetal behaviour in normal pregnancies after 41 weeks of gestation (287 days, menstrual age, GA) as compared to control term fetuses. Furthermore, we wanted to see if the findings might have consequences for clinical management. Twelve healthy women with GA between 289 and 298 days participated. All pregnancies were reliably dated and at the time of the study, there was a normal amount of fluid. Twelve healthy women with GA 273-287 days served as controls. All subjects underwent a behavioural study using cardiotocography to record the heart rate (CTG), and two ultrasound scanners to observe body and eye movements, as described previously. All fetuses in both groups clearly exhibited FBS 1F-4F which fitted the definitions of Nijhuis et al. [5]. The median percentage of FBS 3F and 4F ('awake states') increased significantly from 6% in the term group to 21.5% in the fetuses after 41 weeks (P = 0.014). FBS 1F ('quiet sleep') and 2F ('active sleep') decreased from 92 to 78% (P = 0.014), mainly at the expense of FBS 2F which decreased from 78 to 58% (P = 0.002). This indicates increasing wakefulness in utero. The fetal heart rate patterns (FHRP) associated with FBS 3F and 4F were impressive. For example, in FBS 4F, the FHRP showed large amplitude, prolonged accelerations which fused into a sustained tachycardia with only short periods of return to the baseline, resembling tachycardia with decelerations. We conclude that in normal pregnancies after 41 weeks, the development of the fetal central nervous system continues, resulting in an increasing percentage of 'fetal wakefulness'. The CTG-patterns that result from these behaviours can easily mimic fetal distress and one should be aware of this phenomenon. Whether behavioural studies can be used to distinguish 'normal' from 'abnormal' fetuses after term awaits further study. © 1994.

AB  - Whereas conventional time-unspecified single measurements of blood pressure and heart rate may mislead, influenced as they are, among other factors, by the individual's emotional state, position, diet and external stimuli generally, the chronobiologic evaluation of predictable variability in these physiologic variables assesses early cardiovascular disease risk in pregnancy by (a) the use of fully ambulatory devices and (b) the proper processing of the time series thus obtained. We have used this approach to quantify changes in 24-h synchronized circadian characteristics of cardiovascular variables in two consecutive pregnancies of a clinically healthy woman. The results were then compared with those obtained from data sampled after the second pregnancy. Blood pressure and heart rate were automatically monitored, at 1-h intervals, each time for at least 48 consecutive hours, and for a total of 76 days of monitoring in each pregnancy. Circadian parameters of those circulatory variables were computed for each 48-h profile of measurements by the least-squares fit of a 24-h cosine curve. Regression analysis of parameters thus obtained revealed patterns of variation of circadian rhythm-adjusted means and amplitudes with gestational age. In both pregnancies, the predictable variability of the circadian rhythm-adjusted mean of blood pressure can be approximated by a second-order polynomial model on gestational age: a steady linear decrease in systolic, mean arterial and diastolic blood pressures up to the 22nd week of pregnancy is followed by an increase up to the day of delivery. This pattern of variation is not found for data similarly sampled during non-pregnancy on the same woman. This longitudinal study confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable pregnancy-associated variability in blood pressure and heart rate and also allows the establishment of prediction and confidence limits for cardiovascular parameters in a healthy pregnancy.

AB  - The assessment of anticipated variability in blood pressure and heart rate by utilizing fully ambulatory devices and the appropriate processing of the time series secured, can be beneficial in examining early cardiovascular disease risk in pregnant women. A total of 193 pregnant women furnished 301 blood pressure data taken every hour for 48 hours with an ambulatory device. The circadian variables of blood pressure were computed on the outset for every profile of measurement, using the least-squares fit of a 24-hour cosine curve, and then applied in circadian rhythm characteristics assessment for both the uncomplicated group and the complicated group. Based on the consequences, a significant increase of blood pressure was found in pregnancies with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia in all trimesters of pregnancy. However, these variances took place within systolic and diastolic blood pressure values within the present acceptable scope of physiological variation.

AB  - Bouts of hiccuping are recognized by pregnant women as distinct episodic movements of their fetuses. Ultrasound imaging of these fetuses has documented the occurrence of hiccups from early gestation through parturition. This study provides a systematic characterization of prenatal hiccuping in the fetal baboon (Papio species). Tracheal fluid pressure was recorded from 11 chronically instrumented fetal baboons for 21.5 ± 7.3 consecutive days (mean ± SD) over a range in gestation from 124 to 164 days (term 175 days). In an initial review of pressure recordings by visual inspection, hiccups were recognized as distinctive high-amplitude fluctuations in tracheal pressure that were readily discriminated from fetal breaths. Automated techniques were then developed and validated to detect hiccups and summarize their features. The mean hiccup amplitude was 23.0 ± 3.1 mmHg, inspiratory time was 0.26 ± 0.03 s, and expiratory time was 0.27 ± 0.02 s. Each of these features discriminated hiccups from breaths (P &lt; 0.001). Hiccuping incidence (1.8 ± 0.4% of time), rate (26.2 ± 6.2 min- 1), bout duration (4.3 ± 0.8 min), and the interval between bouts (3.35 ± 0.60 h) were also different (P &lt; 0.01) from breathing. These features of hiccups remained relatively constant over the latter third of gestation with the exception of an increase in duration of the expiratory time interval (r = 0.54, P &lt; 0.01). Despite their vigorous nature, bouts of hiccuping were not associated with transitions in behavioral state. Moreover, the features of hiccups were not differentiated by state. Bouts of hiccuping recurred in a cyclic fashion, on average every 3-4 h. The duration of bouts had a diurnal rhythmicity (r = 0.59, P &lt; 0.005), with longer bouts at night than during the day. It is concluded that the mechanisms generating hiccups are largely distinct from those that regulate fetal breathing and that the characteristics of hiccups and bouts of hiccuping are similar across primate species.

AB  - Several studies aimed at testing the effects of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid treatment (ASA, aspirin) in the prevention of preeclampsia conclude that beneficial effects of such treatment outweigh adverse ones. Since recent results suggest that desired effects upon lipoperoxides and β-adrenergic receptors are dependent on the circadian timing of ASA administration, we aim to study if ASA therapy can be optimized by timing according to the rest-activity cycle. Accordingly, before conducting clinical trials on pregnant women, we have examined in clinically healthy subjects the possibility that effects of ASA upon blood pressure could indeed be time-dependent. We studied 55 healthy subjects (35 men and 20 women), 19-24 years of age (mean ± SD: 20.9 ± 1.8). Subjects were living on their usual diurnal waking (~ 08:00 to ~ 24:00), nocturnal resting routine during sampling, following every-day life conditions without any restriction. The systolic, mean arterial and diastolic blood pressures and heart rates of each subject were automatically monitored every 30 min. for 48 hrs with an ABPM-630 Colin (Komaki, Japan) device before and after a one-week course of aspirin (500 mg/day). Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups, according to the circadian timing of administration of the daily dose of ASA: within two hours of awakening (R x 1), seven to nine hours after awakening (R x 2), or within two hours before bedtime (R x 3). The second blood pressure profile was obtained during the sixth and seventh days of treatment (to avoid differences in activity dependent on the day of the week). Results indicate a statistically significant blood pressure reduction (negative mean area between the blood pressure profiles obtained before and after aspirin administration) only when ASA was given seven to nine hours after awakening (R x 2; P = .012, .003, and .006 for systolic, mean arterial and diastolic blood pressure, respectively). These results were corroborated by a non-parametric (sign) test, also indicating the significant reduction in systolic and diastolic BP for R x 2 (P = .003 and .010, respectively). Non-invasive BP monitoring combined with the proper analysis of the time series thus obtained could then provide a cost-effective approach for testing the circadian optimization of long-term ASA administration for both cardiovascular disease prophylaxis and prevention of preeclampsia.

AB  - Genetic risk is a primary contributing factor to the predisposition of a newborn child to elevated blood pressure later in life. An index for this factor is needed to assess in the neonate the success or failure of preventive interventions instituted for the pregnant woman. This index could be based on characteristics describing the variability of blood pressure and heart rate during the first days after birth. In the search for such an index, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rates of 150 newborn babies were automatically monitored at about 30-minute intervals for 48h with a Nippon Colin device, starting early after birth. On the basis of questionnaires given to the parents, the neonates were assigned to a group of either a negative or positive family history of high blood pressure, according to the absence or presence of high blood pressure and/or related cardiovascular disease in two generations (those of the newborn's parents and grandparents). Circadian characteristics and descriptive statistics for the three circulatory variables were used for classification by a so-called 'monotest', an all-subsets variable selection technique for biomedical discriminant analysis. For a particular combination of variables, the 'monotest' performs as many steps of separate analyses as the total number of subjects, each subject's data being compared as a set with those of all others ('leave-one-out' approach). When the circadian amplitude of systolic blood pressure was used as classifier, the 'monotest' yielded a 63% classification equivalent to prior criteria, the latter being based on a negative or a positive family history of high blood pressure. The 'monotest' complements rhythmometric procedures and defines a set of individualized criteria for risk assessment. The combined use of automatic hardware for time-specified sampling with proper software for signal processing and discriminant analysis allows to recognize parameters of blood pressure circadian variability as a source of information for neonatal classification according to cardiovascular disease risk.

AB  - This article describes some of the experiences encountered by two women with spinal cord injuries (SCI) during pregnancy. Pregnant women, with or without a SCI, encounter some common experiences. Common complaints of pregnancy for both include urinary tract infections, sleep problems, and constipation. Complaints specific to those women with a SCI centered around issues such as increased urinary incontinence, autonomic dysreflexia and delayed wound healing. The women with SCI neither developed pressure areas nor experienced premature deliveries, major complications predicted by literature. Women with SCI have felt that they were victims of inadequate environmental designs that hindered their mobility and inhibited their independence. Many of the psychosocial aspects studied proved to be common to pregnant women in general and not specific to individuals with spinal cord injury.

AB  - Temperament differences between cotwins at least 15% discordant for birthweight were compared for a group of 66 preterm twin pairs and a group of 70 fullterm twin pairs, assessed in the neonatal period. The assessment focused on irritability, resistance to soothing, activity, reactivity, and reinforcement value. For the most part, significant differences were not obtained between discordant preterm cotwins. Previous research had demonstrated that the larger fullterm twin of discordant pairs was more irritable, more difficult to soothe, more active while awake and during sleep, less reactive to visual and auditory stimuli, and less reinforcing to the examiner than the smaller cotwin. It was concluded that, for the behavioral variables measured, the fullterm group is at higher risk than the preterm group, and that both the lighter and the heavier discordant twins displayed signs of early behavioral risk. The findings suggested that the continued gestation for cotwins discordant in weight may be a risk period for early temperament development of the twins.

AB  - The general pharmacological properties of lazabemide, a novel MAO-B inhibitor, alone or in combination with MADOPAR were examined in mice, rats, guinea-pigs, rabbits, cats and dogs. The p.o. administration of lazabemide to mice and rats did not produce any gross behavioral changes at any dose. Lazabemide did not exert any effect on rectal temperature, pupil size, spontaneous locomotor activity, Metrazole-induced convulsions or methylhexabital-induced sleep in mice nor did it show any analgesic action in mice and muscle relaxation in rabbits. Lazabemide did not markedly modify the spontaneous EEG activity and EEG arousal responses to sensory stimulations (the midbrain reticular formation and algetic stimulation) in cats. Treatment with lazabemide in combination with MADOPAR neither inhibited nor augmented the effects of MADOPAR on gross behavior or methylhexabital-induced sleep in mice. Lazabemide, when given together with MADOPAR, showed no inhibitory effect on metrazole-induced convulsions, but tended to produce convulsions in a dose-dependent manner (2.5-40 mg/kg p.o.). Nevertheless, the EEG arousal elicited by MADOPAR at 100 mg/kg was not modified by combined treatment with lazabemide. In anesthetized beagle dogs, the i.v. administration of lazabemide caused no overt changes in cardiovascular function, electrocardiographic characteristics, and respiratory function. Lazabemide was devoid of relevant influence on gastrointestinal function (intestinal propulsive motility in mice), and on renal functions (urine volume and urinary excretions of electrolytes in saline-loaded rats). In isolated smooth muscle preparations (guinea-pig ileum and trachea), lazabemide applied at a low concentration did not affect the spontaneous muscle tonicity and contractility. However, at a high concentration (10-5g/ml) it augmented the constrictory and relaxatory responses to agonists, reflecting secondary actions accompanied by an increase in basal tone. The spontaneous motility of the uterus excised from pregnant or non-pregnant rats remained unchanged in the presence of lazabemide. Based on these results, it is suggested that lazabemide has no serious untoward effects on central or peripheral functions except for an increase in the basal tone of isolated smooth muscle preparations. Moreover, lazabemide, when given in combination with MADOPAR, did not modify the effects of MADOPAR. Thus, lazabemide was proven to be safe and well tolerated in laboratory animals.

AB  - This study was designed to characterize behavioral states in the fetal baboon. Automated methods were developed and validated to recognize behavioral states based on relationships among three physiologic variables (EEG patterns, eye movements, heart period variability). Data included twelve 16-h records from 3 chronically instrumented fetal baboons at 0.8-0.9 of term. Randomly generated control records were used to differentiate occurrences of state from chance association of the variables. For 41.2 ± 4.6% (mean ± S.E.) of the time, the physiologic variables were synchronous and formed cycles of state with a mean duration of 34.4 min. Components of these cycles had mean ± S.E. durations of 7.2 ± 0.3 min for state 1FB (the analogue of quiet sleep in the human infant and state 1F in the human fetus), 20.7 ± 1.2 min for the state 2FB (the analogue of active sleep in the human infant and state 2F in the human fetus), and 3.6 ± 0.2 min for state transitions. For 24.6 ± 2.4% of the time, the state variables exhibited coincidental, state-like agreements, that were not part of state cycles. Finally, for 34.3 ± 2.7% of the time, there was no systematic agreement among the three variables. These data provide convincing evidence that organized behavioral states are present in the fetal baboon as early as 0.8 of term gestation. © 1994.

AB  - White male rats, intact and pregnant females were subjected for 3 days to deprivation of paradoxical sleep by the technique of Jouvet. The main resulting vectors of the extreme state outcome, i.e., lethality, susceptibility to stress, and neurotization, made it possible to establish corresponding levels of resistance. A relationship of each of the levels with the ability to form conditioned reflexes, initial functional interhemispheric asymmetry and behavioural status, expression of protective reactions and paradoxical sleep under conditions of an insoluble conflict situation was followed. High resistance of pregnant rats is considered to be associated with the formation of gestational ambilaterality of the brain of intact animals. Such an increase in resistance is selective as far as it concerns the organism of the pregnant and it does not ensure stability of the feto-maternal complex under extreme conditions. It was established that there was an inverse relationship between the expression of neurotic disorders of the higher nervous activity and vegeto-morphological features of acute stress. This gives reason to define more exactly the role of neurotic disorders in the pathogenesis of stress and mechanisms of resistance to extreme factors.

AB  - In 14 normally developing term fetuses, the relationship between the blood flow velocity waveforms at cerebral arterial level (internal carotid artery, anterior, middle and posterior cerebral artery) and fetal behavioural states was studied using Doppler colour flow imaging. Behavioural state dependent changes in absolute flow velocities occurred in all vessels, except for the middle cerebral artery. These changes suggest preferential blood flow to the left heart resulting in increased flow to the cerebrum during fetal behavioural state 2F (active sleep) when compared with fetal behavioural state 1F (quiet sleep). The middle cerebral artery supplies the neocerebrum. This developing part of the cerebrum does not seem to take part in the regulation of fetal behaviour. In the internal carotid artery, an inverse relationship between peak systolic velocity and fetal heart rate could be established, which can be explained by a shorter rapid filling phase at raised fetal heart rate according to the Frank-Starling Law. © 1994.

AB  - Prenatal treatment with the D1-dopamine receptor agonist SKF 38393 or cocaine induces expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos in the fetal rat suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (Weaver et al., 1992). Because the induction of c-fos gene expression in the SCN has been implicated in the entrainment of circadian rhythms by light in mature animals, the present study investigated whether prenatal dopaminergic activation entrains the fetal circadian pacemaker. Injections of SKF 38393 (8 mg/kg) were given to pregnant, SCN- lesioned hamsters during the last 5 d of gestation and the phases of the offspring's wheel-running activity rhythms were measured on postnatal day 20. Pregnant hamsters were each given two injections/day 12 hr apart, but only one of the injections each day contained SKF 38393. One group of hamsters received the drug at 0800 hr while another group received the drug at 2000 hr. The offspring from these treatment groups showed average phases that differed by 11.3 hr, demonstrating that prenatal SKF 38393 set the phase of the offspring's circadian rhythms. These results suggest that the fetal circadian pacemaker can be entrained by dopaminergic activation. In situ hybridization using cRNA probes demonstrated that a single injection of SKF 38393 on the last day of gestation induced c-fos gene expression in the fetal hamster SCN and that mRNA for the D1-dopamine receptor was present in the SCN at that time. It is possible that maternal entrainment of the fetal circadian pacemaker, which normally occurs during development, is mediated by dopaminergic activation within the fetal hypothalamus.

AB  - The awareness of the inherent risks attached to medication use during pregnancy is increasing. There is, however, a paucity of available following childbirth. We have conducted a prospective study in women who gave birth in hospital with the objective of analysing the use of medication in this lying in period. The results show that, in addition to the vitamins and minerals routinely prescribed for every young mother and the antipyretics administered as required, the following medicaments were most often used: analgesics (by approx. 9%), antiinflammatory agents (49%) and antibiotics (38%). The antibiotics were either used prophylactically or, in cases of proven infection, administered therapeutically. The use of antibiotics appears more intensive compared to western countries, presumably due to the greater risk of infection in this group in India. On the other hand, the use of sleep inducing medication and tranquillizers during the lying in period appears, in comparison to other studies, almost negligable. The majority of the women were unaware of the potential side-effects of medication during breastfeeding. © 1994 Birkhäuser Verlag.

AB  - 100 women participated in an open randomised study. 50 of them received 0,5 mg PGE2 in 2.5 ml Triacetin gel (Prepidil R) intracervically in the morning (6.00 a.m.) and 50 at night (10.00 p.m.). The success rate was 74% (37 of 50) in the treatment group of the night compared with 52 (26 of 50) in the group of morning labor induction. A second dose after 8 hours was necessary in 26% (13 of 50) in the night group and in 48% (24 of 50) of the morning labor induction. Labor induction failed completely in 32% of the morning and in 12% of the night group. The induction time for contractions was 2 hours shorter after night labor induction, in primiparae the duration of first stage was 2 hours shorter but in multiparae there was no difference between the groups. There was also no difference in intrapartum and postpartum complications between the groups. In conclusion the induction of labor with intracervical PGE2 at night seems be to more effective without increasing the rate of complications.

AB  - This manuscript describes the use of staining of Fos-related antigens (FRAs) as markers for changes in neuronal activity. The model system consisted of the tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Under normal conditions, these neurons are devoid of c-Fos staining even though the neurons are tonically active and can express FRAs. During specific neuroendocrine states the neurons undergo changes in activity, as described by other studies. At times when the activity is relatively high as in pregnancy and during proestrus, approximately 50%-60% of the TIDA neurons expressed FRA immunoreactivity. Moreover changes over the course of proestrus paralleled known shifts in TIDA activity (declining as the day progressed). At times when TIDA activity is suppressed, such as during lactation, FRA staining in TIDA neurons was markedly reduced or absent. Upon removal of the suckling stimulus, FRA staining rose to reach peak expression 12-24 h after pup removal (without coordinate induction of c-Fos). These data suggest that FRA staining can serve as a useful marker of activity in the TIDA neurons which permits not only assessment of stimulated activity but also suppressed function in the neurons. A cautionary note in using this approach along with acquisition of serial blood samples for hormone measurement is that surgical procedures for monitoring plasma hormone levels are associated with strong long-lived induction of FRAs (and c-Fos) in many neurons (including the TIDA neurons) that can canfound interpretation of FRA staining. © 1994.

AB  - We investigated the possible effects of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on sleep-wake phases and other associated behaviors controlled by the medial preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic epidural electroencephalographic (EEG) and temporal muscle electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were placed in cycling female rats. After a week of recovery, rats were injected intraperitoneally at 3.00 pm on the day of proestrus with either saline or highly purified hCG or indomethacin or hCG plus indomethacin. Three hours after injection, EEG, EMG and behavioral activities were recorded for 3.5 h. The administration of hCG increased high and low amplitude sleep, resting phase and decreased active awake phase, walking, sniffing and chewing as compared to the controls. While the administration of indomethacin alone had no effect, coadministration inhibited hCG effects. Medial preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus contain immunostaining for LH/hCG receptors. The administration of hCG resulted in an increase of immunoreactive PGD2 and a decrease of PGE2 in median preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus as compared to the controls. In summary, hCG administration affects sleep-wake phases and other associated behaviors in rats which can collectively be described as decreased activity. These effects are probably mediated by increasing PGD2 and decreasing PGE2 in areas of brain which control these activities. The above findings may be relevant to pregnant women who experience decreased activity when hCG is present in the circulation and cerebrospinal fluid. © 1994.

AB  - Sequential changes in cerebral blood flow and regional distribution were studied in nine chronically catheterized fetal sheep during the transition to the low-voltage ECOG (REM) state to determine the time course for blood flow change within the brain and whether executive centres for REM state generation might thus be identified. Blood flows were measured during the first, second and third minutes after the transition to the low-voltage ECOG state and during the third minute of the subsequent high-voltage ECOG (NREM) state using the radioactive labelled microsphere technique. Blood flow to the brain was increased during the low-voltage REM state when compared to that of the high-voltage NREM state, with the increase evident when measured during the first minute after the state transition and with no sequential change thereafter. Regional blood flow increases during the low-voltage state were greatest to those areas variously associated with the generation of REM state activity, but were again remarkably stable through the first 3 minutes after the state transition. This rapid increase in blood flow within the brain and the regional hierarchy for such, supports the participation of multiple anatomical areas which are highly integrated and act in concert to give rise to what is known as the REM state. © 1994.

AB  - Health visitors and general practitioners are often asked for help because of what parents perceive as a baby's sleeping problem. Many parents expect that the baby will be sleeping continuously through the night from a given age, often as early as six weeks old. The conflict between the parents' expectations and the baby's behaviour leads the parents to seek help. Analysis of the first 640 questionnaires received from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC). Study show that many six-month-old babies have broken nights. Only 16% slept through the night at six months old. Half woke occasionally, 9% woke most nights, 5% woke once every night and a further 17% woke more than once per night, ranging from twice to eight times. For 16% of six-month-olds there was no regular sleeping pattern. Parents use a variety of strategies when the baby wakes at night, including rocking or cuddling, giving a dummy or feeding with milk or another drink. By six months old, 61% of babies slept in a room on their own, but 15% were always or usually brought into the parents' bed if they woke, and 34% sometimes 28% of babies aged six months routinely slept in the parents' bedroom. Knowing that their baby's behaviour pattern is "normal" and shared by many other babies of the same age is often reassuring to parents.

AB  - Electrical stimulation (0.33 Hz, 0.2 mA) applied bilaterally to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) of newly mated female mice revealed that stimulation for 4 h was sufficient to produce pregnancy block providing stimulation is given for two separate 2-h periods coincident with prolactin surges. Stimulation for two 1-h periods coincident with prolactin surges or two 2-h periods between prolactin surges was without effect. These results indicate that electrical stimulation of the AOB can faithfully reproduce pheromone-induced pregnancy block and support the view that prolactin is the hormone mainly responsible for the olfactory block to pregnancy. © 1994.

AB  - The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) have daily fluctuations in energy consumption with glucose utilization high in the day, and low at night. In a previous study, we used [14C]2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake to index the phase of the SCN, and found that in intact hamsters bearing SCN grafts in the third ventricle (3V), the native and grafted SCN, which were initially 12 h out of phase, became synchronized to the phase of the host clock [32]. In the present study, adult males (host animals) and pregnant females (source of donor tissue) were housed in opposite light-dark cycles. Host animals were sacrificed 14 days after implantation with either (1) SCN grafts into the lateral ventricle (LV), or (2) cortical grafts into 3V, or (3) SCN grafts in 3V of pinealectomized hamster. The results indicate that rhythms of 2-DG uptake are not induced in cortical tissue grafts, that the host SCN does not entrain SCN grafts located in the LV, and that entrainment of the grafted SCN (located in 3V) by the host circadian system occurs in the absence of pineal secretions. © 1994.

AB  - Several 24-h rhythms have been observed in the mother and in the fetus during primate gestation. In the mother, 24-h rhythms occur in biophysical variables, pregnancy-associated plasma hormones and preparturient myometrial activity. In addition, both pregnant non-human primates and pregnant women deliver preferentially during the night and early morning hours. A crucial question pertaining circadian rhythms is whether 24-h rhythms that may be observed during pregnancy are endogenous in nature and entrained by the light-dark cycle or whether the daily photoperiod is a causal stimulus. Our work has addressed the role of the maternal and fetal circadian system for 24-h rhythms in pregnancy-associated maternal plasma hormones, preparturient myometrial activity and parturition in human and non-human primate pregnancy. In the present review, the results of some of our studies are being discussed in combination with data available from the literature. It is apparent that 24-h rhythms that may be observed during primate pregnancy are determined by the maternal circadian system, suggesting that the developing fetus receives information about the ambient time of the day via the mother. Fetal entrainment by the mother may ensure fetal cooperation so that parturition occurs at the most favorable time of the day. We conclude that the functioning of the maternal circadian system is integral to the pregnant state. Thus, proper care and management of pregnant women and the ultimate outcome of obstetrics may benefit from more timely methodologies. A chronopharmacological attitude towards the prevention of premature labor and the induction and augmentation of labor at term may yield new therapeutic strategies. Such an approach will enable delivery to take place under optimal conditions for mother and child. © 1994.

AB  - The aim of the second part of this review is to critically discuss the efficacy, safety and clinical aspects of nicotine replacement therapies. Nicotine replacement therapy is the only simple smoking cessation intervention to have had its efficacy confirmed by randomised clinical trials. It is appealing to smokers because most wish to quit without assistance from formal cessation programs. Nicotine replacement is effective in smokers who are well motivated to quit and who are significantly nicotine dependent. Transdermal nicotine is the easiest form of nicotine delivery to use and has the lowest dependence potential. Concurrent smoking and use of nicotine replacement products is inadvisable but represents a low risk to healthy individuals. The pooled odds ratios of long-term abstinence rates in randomised clinical trials are: nicotine chewing gum 1.7 and transdermal nicotine 2.3. Common adverse effects of 24 hour transdermal nicotine are transient application site itch, sleep disturbance and local skin reactions. Nicotine replacement therapies should be a last resort for the treatment of smokers with unstable coronary artery disease, or women who are pregnant, because of theoretical risks associated with treatment. In conclusion, nicotine replacement therapy is a logical approach for motivated, significantly nicotine-dependent smokers unable to quit by simpler means. Results can be augmented by the inclusion of other interventions, such as cessation counselling.

AB  - While the number of mothers resuming employment soon after the birth of a child is growing, knowledge about the effect that having both a baby and a job has on mental and physical health is still scarce. In this paper, we studied the health of 141 Italian first-time mothers, who were all employed during pregnancy. When their child was 15 months old, 84% were back at work; 24-36% suffered from lack of sleep, extreme tiredness and backache; more than half had experienced some feelings of depression since the birth. Considering the whole sample, poorly educated and unmarried mothers reported more physical health problems. Being employed per se showed no influence, but poorly educated mothers and those with a less qualified job reported more problems. On the basis of our results, we suggest that future research on new mothers, work and health should systematically include “domestic” variables and the characteristics of the paid job; and should analyze more thoroughly the influence of marriage status and educational level on health. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Family planning policy in Burkina Faso aims to improve maternal and child health. Family planning services are oriented towards modern contraceptives and tend to target women. Yet, the man has a large responsibility in the life of the family. He makes the important decisions on sexual relations and, therefore, on family planning. Family planning in terms of spacing of births interests many men. If family planning is presented as birth spacing, men would be in favor of it. Services adapted to men's needs will prove useful. Some men even want to limit the number of their children. A man from Burkina Faso believes that having many children is not a sign of affluence but of poverty. In rural areas, despite the lack of sanitation, weak means and methods of contraception, the people have information on family planning. Dispensaries are centers of distribution of such messages. The messages of the mass media are often misunderstood. A father of 6 who was older than 60 was unaware of methods to limit fertility. Sexual abstinence is no longer a rule in rural areas, at least among the youth. In the villages, young couples often face the many problems of too close pregnancies. Male violence is equally responsible for some situations. The drunk husband enters the home while falling and making his wife sleep with him. This violence is an obstacle to freedom in matters of production. It is not easy to change their attitude. One has simply ignored the influential role of men. Men are even forgotten in conception programs. Since 1981 in Mauritania, the family health program has had a fathers' school which sensitizes men to the problems of women, children, and family planning. The Ghanian Family Planning Association sponsors Dads' Clubs.

AB  - In the present study, we examined the regulation of 24-h serum immunoreactive levels, in vitro biological to immunological (B/I) ratio, and median charge of circulating CG at the end of the first, second, and third trimesters of human gestation. Seven pregnant women were prospectively studied at 12-15, 23-26, and 35-38 weeks of gestation. Blood was sampled every 20 min over a 24-h period, and serum CG concentrations were determined by RIA. Pulse detection and analysis of the 24-h rhythm of serum immunoreactive CG concentrations were carried out by the program Cluster and cosine curve fitting, respectively. The in vitro biological activity of circulating CG was determined by the mouse Leydig cell-testosterone production bioassay, and the median charge of its isoforms was determined by zone electrophoresis in agarose suspension. The immunoreactive levels of CG present at the end of each trimester of gestation fluctuated over a 24-h period; such variability exceeded that of the within-assay coefficient of variation of the CG RIA and could be resolved into a series of CG peaks and valleys. Although no trend in the number of peaks or valleys was systematically found in relation to gestational age, comparisons between the amplitude and area of the CG peaks revealed that these pulse parameters were significantly higher at 12-15 weeks than at 23-26 and 35-38 weeks of gestation. Cosine fits for 24-h rhythms revealed the existence of significant nyctohemeral profiles of serum CG levels in all women studied at 12-15 weeks, in four subjects at 23-26 weeks, and in six women at 35-38 weeks gestation. The time of acrophase was highly homogeneous only between 12-15 weeks of gestation, occurring between 1057-1452 h in six of the women. The in vitro B/I ratio of CG contained in serum pools from 12-15 weeks was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that exhibited by CG during later gestational periods (B/I ratio at the end of first trimester, 1.14 ± 0.14; second trimester, 0.87 ± 0.22; third trimester, 0.79 ± 0.12). hCG isoforms at 12-15 weeks were more negatively charged than those circulating at 23-26 and 35-38 weeks of gestation. There were no significant differences between the B/I ratio and the median charge of CG molecules from the second and third trimesters. We conclude that serial serum concentrations of CG throughout pregnancy show significant amplitude-modulated pulsatile release and nyctohemeral variations. The amplitude-regulated pulsatile mode of release is probably endowed by the placenta. These changes in episodic CG release throughout gestation are concomitantly accompanied by alterations in the molecular structure of the gonadotropin, thus indicating the existence of a variety of distinct mechanisms through which the placenta regulates the intensity, biochemical composition, and/or clearance of the CG signal.

AB  - The nonstress test (NST) is a helpful adjunct in the management of high- risk pregnancies. It has high predictability and a low false-negative rate but unfortunately has fairly high false-positive results. Attempts have been made to find a suitable stimulant to help decrease nonreactive results as well as to shorten the duration of testing; the recently introduced fetal acoustic stimulation test (AST) may have such attributes. This prospective, randomized clinical trial was carried out to assess the new test. A total of 1,300 individual tests were performed on high-risk pregnancies. Cases were randomized to receive either the AST or NST. All tracings were interpreted blindly by an independent perinatologist. The incidence of nonreactive tests was 6.8% in the AST group and 13.8% in the NST group (P < .001). There was a significant reduction in the time needed for a reactive test to occur. It can be concluded, therefore, that AST offers a greater advantage over NST by lowering both the incidence of nonreactive tests and testing time, thereby resulting in less of a need for the contraction stress test and biophysical profile.

AB  - Objective: To review current knowledge of the efficacy, safety and cost of transdermal nicotine therapy for smoking cessation. Data sources and study selection: 1. Published and unpublished reports of randomised, double-blind trials of at least 12 weeks' duration, in smokers motivated to cease smoking, identified by a search of the MEDLINE database, article and book bibliographies, Current contents, and by a request to the Medical Department of Ciba-Geigy (Australia) Ltd. 2. A clinical trial of 1500 smokers using transdermal nicotine (S Gourlay, unpublished data). Data synthesis: Transdermal nicotine more than doubles the success rates of smoking cessation attempts in motivated subjects who smoke at least 10-15 cigarettes per day (odds ratio 12 months after quitting, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-3.4). Application site reactions are not uncommon (erythema or burning ≤ 16%, transient itch <50%) and cause discontinuation of therapy in up to 10% of subjects. Sleep disturbance due to nocturnal nicotine absorption occurs in up to 13% of subjects when patches are worn overnight. Smoking or nicotine chewing gum used concurrently with transdermal nicotine could raise peak nicotine levels but is unlikely to adversely affect individuals with established tolerance to nicotine. Smoking and (theoretically) nicotine replacement therapies should be avoided in pregnancy or patients with unstable coronary artery disease. In such patients, the risk-benefit ratio of nicotine replacement therapies may be favourable for nicotine-dependent smokers unable to cease smoking by alternative methods. Conclusions: Transdermal nicotine is an effective smoking cessation therapy for motivated, nicotine-dependent smokers. As most smokers can cease smoking on their own, and the patches are costly, they should be recommended only for smokers who are unable to quit by simpler means and those likely to suffer severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

AB  - The present review is devoted to effects on the newborn of maternal ingestion of caffeine during gestation and lactation. In rodents, caffeine is able to induce malformations, but usually at high doses never encountered in humans; indeed, when caffeine is administered in fractioned quantities during the day, as it is the case with human caffeine intake, caffeine is no longer a teratogen in rodents. Caffeine ingested during gestation induces a dose-dependent decrease in body weight, but only for large doses (>7 cups/day of coffee), whereas it has no effect at moderate doses. Maternal caffeine consumption during gestation affects hematologic parameters in both rat and human infants and induces long-term effects on sleep, locomotion, learning abilities, emotivity and anxiety in rodent offspring, whereas in humans, more studies are needed to determine the consequences of early caffeine exposure on behavior. Investigators do not agree on the quantities of the methylxanthine found in breast milk, but caffeine does not change breast milk composition, and rather, stimulates milk production. We conclude in this review that maternal caffeine consumption in moderate amounts during gestation and lactation has no measurable consequences on the fetus and newborn infant. Pregnant mothers, however, should be advised to consume coffee and caffeinated beverages in moderation, especially because of the prolonged half-life of caffeine both during the last trimester of pregnancy and in the newborn infant. © 1994 American College of Nutrition.

AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure measurements were performed in 8 patients with normotensive pregnancy by means of an oscillometric ABPM monitor (Spacelab 90207) to investigate trimenon-specific differences in 24-hour blood pressure profiles. All patients showed a significant decline of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) throughout pregnancy. Circadian rhythm was prevailed in all the pregnants investigated, i.e. they showed a nocturnal decrease or dipping of blood pressure of more than 10% as compared with daily BP. 24-hour BP was lowest in the second trimenon due to a significant fall in night BP in comparison with the first and third trimenon (p<0.01). Diastolic BP that initially declined in the first trimenon constantly increased to reach normal values in the third trimenon again.

AB  - The effects of prenatal and postnatal protein malnutrition on the major and minor somatic axes of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) cells of the rat were investigated. Female rats were fed either 6%, 8% or 25% casein diet 5 weeks before mating, during gestation and lactation. After weaning the pups were maintained on the same diet until sacrifice at 30, 90 or 220 days of age. The major and minor axes in fusiform, multipolar and ovoid cells were measured in Nissl-stained SCN slices. Although the 8% diet group displayed significant reductions in fusiform and ovoid cells, the 6% diet group showed the most intense reductions in cell size of the three cell types. In the 6% diet group, cell size was significantly lower at 30 days but the difference with the other nutritional groups ameliorated at 90 days and almost reached control values at 220 days. These data suggest that malnutrition maintained during gestation and postnatal life reduces the somatic size of SCN cells. This alteration may be a morphological substrate underlying sleep and behavioral circadian alterations observed in malnourished rats.

Methods: Twenty nulliparous pregnant women after 20 weeks' gestation, 10 normotensive and 10 hypertensive women matched for gestational age, were hemodynamically investigated using 24-h AP monitoring and Doppler echocardiography to determine LV structures and functions, both systolic and diastolic. Results: The hypertensive women had significantly higher AP determinations throughout the 24 h, with no change in diurnal variation, i.e. nocturnal decline and early morning peaks. Their LV mass was greater and it was accompanied by a slight reduction in contractility and a significant reduction in LV relaxation. The increased AP was due to peripheral vasoconstriction, while cardiac output was preserved. Conclusions: It appears that pregnancy-associated hypertension is caused mainly by arterial vasoconstriction and not by higher cardiac output. The hypertension increases the LV mass, which is associated with a fall in LV relaxation. © 1994.

AB  - The assessment of cortisol in saliva has proven a valid and reliable reflection of the respective unbound hormone in blood. To date, assessment of cortisol in saliva is a widely accepted and frequently employed method in psychoneuroendocrinology. Due to several advantages over blood cortisol analyses (e.g., stress-free sampling, laboratory independence, lower costs) saliva cortisol assessment can be the method of choice in basic research and clinical environments. The determination of cortisol in saliva can facilitate stress studies including newborns and infants and replace blood sampling for diagnostic endocrine tests like the dexamethasone suppression test. The present paper provides an up-to-date overview of recent methodological developments, novel applications as well as a discussion of possible future applications of salivary cortisol determination. © 1994.

AB  - Pregnant patients with increases in blood pressure are often treated with medication, in our view inappropriately. We examined 222 pregnant women who were referred because of two blood pressure determinations > 140/90 mm Hg. The women were primarily treated by nonpharmacological means. Only 44 required medications to maintain a blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg. Twenty-six additional pregnant women referred for hypertension were taught to measure their blood pressures at home. Fourteen underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Home and 24-h blood pressure measurements were both significantly lower than those obtained in the office and did not significantly differ from each other. We conclude that most pregnant women without proteinuria, who show mild to moderate blood pressures > 140/90 mm Hg are best treated conservatively without drugs. Those in whom home or 24-h blood pressures exceed 140/90 mm Hg and who do not respond to nonpharmacologic methods require medication. Finally, 'white coat' hypertension is common in pregnant women.

AB  - We examined the 24 hour plasma profiles of prolactin and β-hCG in 7 women with preterm labour between the 30th and 34th week of gestation. The results showed that, despite preterm labour, the circadian rhythm of prolactin was maintained. The β-hCG levels showed a wide scattering in the normal range which is also characteristic of pregnancy with no complications. In addition we examined the prolactin and β-hCG levels during the last 6 hours preceding delivery. Here we found significant higher hormone concentrations of hCG in the mothers delivered of female babies than in the mothers of males. This higher hormone level declined continuously during the delivery, however, without significance We also observed concordant secretion patterns of prolactin and β-hCG in these cases. Normal hCG and prolactin values were found in mothers delivered of male babies.

AB  - The internal gestation and subsequent lactation of mammalian reproduction represent a considerable physiological challenge. The extent of disruption in the daily rhythm of four parameters, core body temperature, nest attendance, activity, and wheel running, was monitored in Djungarian hamster (Phodopus campbelli) and Siberian hamster (P. sungorus) females implanted intraperitoneally with biotelemetric thermistors. The amplitude of each rhythm decreased during late gestation, culminating in a substantial disruption at parturition, and did not begin a recovery until the latter third of lactation. In each species, the change in the core body temperature rhythm was primarily the result of an elevation in light phase body temperature to approximate the normally occurring dark phase temperature, although the disruption was more extensive in P. sungorus than in P. campbelli. As this maternal hyperthermia is associated with the provision of essential heat to the altricial litter, these species differences in the vulnerability to hyperthermia may constrain the reproductive success of these extreme cold adapted small mammals. © 1994.

AB  - Objectives: To define the profile of 24-hour uterine activity in normal pregnancy and to correlate contraction frequency with physical activity and emotional stress diaries. Methods: One hundred nine low-risk pregnant women who delivered at term recorded uterine contractions for 24 hours twice weekly from 20-40 weeks' gestation using an ambulatory monitor and kept a physical activity and emotional stress diary. Contractions per hour were calculated for each hour of the day and week of gestation, and related to physical activity and emotional stress. Results: We analyzed 71,683 hours. No contractions were recorded in 73% of the hours, and fewer than four contractions per hour occurred in 96%. Significant inter-individual variability was noted. Contractions increased markedly with gestational age: The 95th percentile was 1.3 contractions per hour at 21-24 weeks, 2.9 at 28-32 weeks, and 4.9 at 38-40 weeks. A strong clustering of contractions occurred at night, which became pronounced after 24 weeks (night:day ratio 2:1 at 28-32 weeks). To adjust for the effects of gestational age and time of day, contractions per hour were converted to gestation- and hour-specific percentiles ('contraction percentiles'). Rest was associated with a fall in contraction percentile by 1.25, whereas coitus increased the contraction percentile by 5.52 (P < .05). No changes were noted with emotional stress. Conclusions: This study provides normative contraction data in uncomplicated pregnancy. A strong diurnal rhythm is present from 24 weeks onward, with 67% of contractions occurring at night. Contractions per hour increase with gestational age but rarely exceed three per hour before term. Rest and sexual activity have small but measurable effects on contraction frequency.

AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was used as an effective methodology by a primary care physician to assess normalcy of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate during pregnancy. One hundred fifty pregnant women in one of three periods (18 to 22, 30 to 32, and 36 to 38 weeks) of gestation and 30 age-matched nonpregnant women participated in this study. The study was designed to establish ABPM standards of normalcy during critical times of gestation. Twenty-four-hour BP (systolic and diastolic BP) values monitored during gestational weeks 18 to 22 and 30 to 32 were similar to each other and lower than the same values recorded in nonpregnant women. Blood pressures monitored during gestational weeks 36 to 38 were significantly higher than similar values observed during the two earlier gestational periods but not significantly higher than nonpregnancy BP values. Heart rates were significantly elevated during all gestational periods when compared with nonpregnancy heart rates. The results of this study established normalcy BP curves during three different gestational periods. Mean 24-h, daytime, and nighttime BPs were significantly elevated during weeks 36 to 38 when compared with BPs recorded during gestational weeks 18 to 22 and 30 to 32. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a useful tool for the measurement and treatment of BP abnormalities during pregnancy.

AB  - Objective. We evaluated the efficacy of cosinor analysis of blood pressure (BP) at the second trimester in predicting the subsequent development of gestational hypertension. Study design. We performed the cosinor analysis of BP in 313 normotensive non-proteinuric nulliparous women at the second trimester. We followed the pregnancy up to delivery and recorded the subsequent occurrence of gestational hypertension (sGH). We compared data from this group of 33 patients with those from the 280 women with uncomplicated normotensive pregnancy. We used the ANOVA to compare the means, statistical significance was assessed at p < .05. Results. Diastolic MESOR of women with uncomplicated pregnancy was significantly lower than the GH patients, although both groups were definitely normotensive at the time of the recording. (Diastolic: Controls M=62.2±1.5, A=5.1±0.7, null set=14:07, p=.0001; sGH M=73.5±6.2m, A=5.9±1.1, null set=14:48, p=.003; Systolic: Controls M=108.3±2.2, A=5.2±0.7, null set=15:00, p=.0001; sGH M=122.4±2.1, A=4.1±0.8, null set=15:59, p=.01) We did not find any other significant difference among the population-mean cosinors. The most sensitive cutoff of diastolic blood pressure MESOR proved to be 68 mmHg.

AB  - Individual rat fetuses were exposed to cocaine by injection into the cisterna magna on E20 or E21 of gestation. On E20, cocaine elevated motor activity throughout the 20‐min session, with activity increasing to double SAL‐injected levels by the end of the session. On E21, overall activity also was elevated after cocaine, increasing four‐ to fivefold in the first 5 min of the session, and decreasing to twice the levels of SAL controls thereafter. Movement time series were subjected to spectral analysis to characterize cyclic motor organization. Cyclicity was evident in 67% of control and 97% of cocaine‐injected fetuses. Cocaine increased the number of peaks in the movement spectrum and resulted in greater spectral density at the primary frequency of cyclic movement. Prenatal exposure to cocaine may alter patterns of cyclicity in the fetus, with consequences for the normal development of attention and behavioral state in the neonate.©1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - We investigated the hypothesis that photoperiod information received during the prenatal and/or early postnatal periods influences subsequent development in collared lemmings. Pregnant lemmings were exposed to either a short [8:16-h light-dark cycle (8:16)] or long (22:2) photoperiod throughout gestation. On the day of birth, pups were cross-fostered to dams housed in either short or long photoperiod. After an 11-day experimental lactational period (LACT), all animals were transferred to an intermediate photoperiod (16:8), the response to which depends on prior photoperiod exposure. Pups remained on this photoperiod until death at postnatal day 90. Information received during gestation (GEST) influenced offspring growth, pelage color, guard hair length, presence of the bifid claw at weaning, testes mass at 10 wk postweaning, and serum prolactin (PRL). Parameters measured at weaning reflected directly the photoperiod experienced during GEST (e.g., short-day GEST pups had white pelage). Conversely, parameters measured at 10 wk postweaning reflected the change in photoperiod experienced between GEST and 16:8 (e.g., short-day GEST young had gray pelage, indicative of an increase in photoperiod). Information received during LACT influenced growth and the presence of the bifid claw at weaning.

AB  - Several data emphasize the neuroendocrine aspects of human placenta. Classical hypophyseo‐tropic neurohormones are produced and secreted by the human placenta. Indeed, in contrast with non pregnant subjects, gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) and corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) are measurable in maternal plasma during pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics of the secretory pattern of maternal plasma GnRH and CRF levels. A total of 25 healthy pregnant women participated in the present cross‐sectional study. Plasma levels of the two neurohormones were measured according to three different time‐intervals: 1) every five minutes for eight hours (n=4), 2) every ten minutes for four hours (n= 15), 3) every four hours for 24 hours (n =7). Following an acidic extraction plasma GnRH and CRF levels were measured by specific radioimmunoassay. Using two different algorithms (Detect and Cluster) a pulsatile pattern for both plasma GnRH and CRF levels was observed. Specific pulse frequency, amplitude, and duration were found. In the groups of women studied with a longer sampling interval, pulse frequency of GnRH or CRF levels did not differ between first and third trimester of gestation. However, amplitude of CRF pulses were significantly higher at term than at early stages of pregnancy (p≤0.01), while GnRH pulse amplitude was highest in women at first trimester of gestation. Evaluating the degree of concordance in all subjects, GnRH pulses significantly correlated with CRF pulses at 30 min. lag (p≤0.01). No significant circadian changes were found for any circulating neurohormone measured. The present study showed that maternal circulating neurohormone levels change according to a pulsatile pattern, probably reflecting the placental secretory events. 1994 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted

AB  - Ante- and postpartum noninvasive 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements were performed in 24 patients with preeclampsia or HELLP-syndrome. In contrast to normotensive pregnancy displaying a significant decline of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, preeclamptic women demonstrated significantly elevated blood pressure profiles before delivery that remained elevated up to the fourth week post partum. 6 of 8 patients with severe preeclampsia and 5 of 6 with HELLP-syndrome showed a nocturnal increase of blood pressure within the first week post partum and a non-dipping of nocturnal blood pressure up to the fourth week after delivery. In preeclamptic women blood pressure control should be extended into the night and a antihypertensive therapy should include a sufficient evening dose up to the fourth week post partum.

AB  - It is unclear whether sex steroids influence melatonin secretion in the human. In an attempt to find an answer to this important question 36 women within an age range of 19 to 40 years were studied within a 3-month period under the following conditions: natural menstrual cycle, ovulation induction with gonadotrophins, early pregnancy, and intake of monophasic or triphasic oral contraceptives. Except in the case of pregnancy, repeated measurements in the same individual were done because of the well-known large inter-individual variations in melatonin secretion. Melatonin concentration was measured in plasma samples obtained at 4-hourly intervals in a 24 h period and <200 lux for all subjects studied. No consistent change in melatonin blood concentrations was demonstrated in response to the varying endogenous or exogenous concentrations of sex steroids. These observations suggest that circadian melatonin secretion is not significantly modulated by sex steroids. © 1994 Oxford University Press.

AB  - 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binds in vitro to murine mammary gland membranes, in a specific, saturable, reversible and temperature-dependent and pH-dependent way, displaying an affinity within the low nM range. The order of affinity to displace the radioligand from mammary membranes was: 6-hydroxy-melatonin &gt; 5-hydroxyindoleamines &gt; noradrenaline &gt; 6-chloromelatonin &gt; 5-methoxyindoles (melatonin included). There was a diurnal rhythm in K(d) and B(max) of 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding, displaying the highest affinity and the lowest binding site concentration during the scotophase. The functional significance of melatonin binding sites was indicated by changes in binding parameters related to different rates of mammary growth during puberty, estrous cycle, pregnancy, lactation and the postlactation period.

AB  - Oestrogens have been considered to cause nasal congestion during the menstrual cycle and during pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the degree of nasal congestion during the menstrual cycle in healthy women. Nasal peak expiratory flow (nPEF) was measured and subjective nasal stuffiness was scored morning and evening by 27 women for 3 months and by 14 women for 6 months. During the menstrual days, when the serum oestrogen level is lowest, the morning nPEFs were significantly lower compared with the rest of the cycle (P= 0.0012). The difference was most pronounced for the second day of the cycle (P= 0.00034). The correlation between nPEFs and the subjective scores was high (R= 0.98), while the coefficient of variation within the series of three nPEF recordings was low (6.4%). It is concluded that the nasal obstruction experienced during menstruation cannot be explained by increased serum levels of oestrogen. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The chronic hyperthermia of lactating dwarf hamster (Phodopus) dams may constrain maternal behavior if contact with the litter further increases their body temperature, forcing the termination of nest bouts to dissipate the heat load. Changes in female body temperature and nest attendance in two species of dwarf hamster (P. campbelli and P. sungorus) were recorded each minute over the reproductive cycle. As the pups develop from naked poikilotherms to well-insulated thermoregulators, they function as heat sinks and heat sources. This role of pup development in maternal thermoregulation interacts with the dam's activity, primarily nocturnal wheel running, to produce a complex pattern of heating and cooling in each species. Contact with the pups is more constrained by maternal temperature during the inactive phase (day), and more constrained in P. campbelli than in P. sungorus. The interspecific difference in pup development or maternal thermoregulation is consistent with predictions based on biparental care, and a thermoregulatory role for the male in P. campbelli, but not in P. sungorus. These data suggest that environmental temperature and water availability are ecological variables that affect maternal thermoregulation, reproductive success, and the need for biparental care. © 1994.

AB  - We measured concentrations of meperidine and benzodiazepines in the umbilical serum of all live neonates born in Finland during a single week. Of the neonates, 31.1% were exposed to meperidine or benzodiazepines or both. One hundred twenty‐one mothers of the 261 neonates exposed to meperidine were not recorded in the Finnish Medical Birth Registry as having received analgesic drugs. Infants born to primiparous mothers were more likely to be exposed. The exposures were associated with the type of delivery: vacuum extraction with a high proportion of neonates exposed to meperidine and elective caesarean section with a high proportion of neonates exposed to benzodiazepines. The exposures were influenced by the method of obstetric analgesia: epidural blockade was associated with more frequent exposure to meperidine. No significant circadian variation in exposures was detected. Validation of birth registry data is imperative before they are used for pharmacoepidemiologic studies.

AB  - Both a cross‐sectional and a longitudinal study were performed to investigate whether or not the collection time should be taken into consideration when generating a patient's risk for fetal Down syndrome with multiple marker screening. Diurnal variations of third‐trimester alpha‐fetoprotein (AFP) levels and first‐trimester human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels have been previously reported. In addition, large episodic fluctuations of conjugated and unconjugated oestriol (uE3) as well as a diurnal variation have also been reported in the third trimester. If the levels of these analytes routinely fluctuate during the day, they could affect a patient's risk calculation for fetal Down syndrome. The longitudinal study evaluated ten non‐diabetic women who underwent sequential sampling for AFP, hCG, and uE3. The cross‐sectional study evaluated 1953 patients for these three markers whose time of sampling was recorded between 8·00 a.m. and 5·59 p.m. Using either study design, no significant effect was seen in the median MOM levels of the screening analytes as a function of the time of day.

AB  - Immunoreactivity, cytochemical, immunocytochemical characteristics and subcellular distribution of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) were investigated in blood and/or smear samples from 18 women aged 23-46 years (mean 32.5 years) with trisomy 21 fetuses (17-21 weeks) and 28 women aged 20-42 years (mean 31 years) with normal fetuses (17-22 weeks). Immunochemical NAP investigations were carried out in 8 pathological and 8 normal pregnancies; cytochemical and immunocytochemical procedures were carried out in 18 pregnant women with trisomy 21 fetuses and 28 controls. NAP from women with trisomy 21 fetuses is characterized by: (1) a significant decrease in reactivity with anti-liver-type alkaline phosphatase (AP) and anti-NAP antisera; (2) low or very slight reactivity with antiplacental or anti-intestinal antibodies; (3) marked dispersion of NAP lead citrate reaction products or anti-NAP antibody colloidal gold-labelling in neutrophil cytoplasms, as detected by electron microscopy. This subcellular AP distribution (extramembranous) is different from that of normal NAP sites associated with plasma membrane, nuclear membrane and secretory vesicles. The NAP immunochemical. and cytochemical characteristics suggest that neutrophils of a woman with a trisomy 21 fetus contain two AP isoenzymes: the liver/bone type and an atypical AP.

AB  - Electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep was examined longitudinally in 34 obstetrically healthy volunteers recruited early in pregnancy. All women were free of current psychiatric disorder. Fourteen women had a personal history of affective disorder, and 20 had no history of any psychiatric disorder. EEG sleep was recorded in subjects' homes at specified points from 12 weeks' gestation through 8 months' postpartum to examine the impact of childbearing on sleep and psychiatric symptoms in women with a history of affective disorder. EEG sleep measurements, as well as clinical ratings of sleep, indicated that sleep disturbances were most pronounced over the first 2 to 3 months' postpartum and were characterized primarily by interrupted sleep. The obstetrical course of these women was uneventful, and the outcome with respect to affective disturbances was highly favorable. Nevertheless, childbearing was associated with greater changes in total sleep time and with rapid eye movement (REM) latency reduction in women with a history of affective disorder, even in the absence of clinically significant mood changes. Findings suggest that the sleep system of women with a history of affective disorder may be more sensitive to the psychobiological changes associated with childbearing, as evidenced by earlier onset of sleep disruption over the childbearing course and a reduction in REM latency in the final trimester that persisted throughout the eighth postpartum month. © 1994.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effects of 24 h of hypoxia on fetal swallowing and urine flow rates. The study design included successive 24-h control, hypoxia, and recovery periods. To induce hypoxia, we infused nitrogen into the trachea of late-gestation pregnant sheep. During hypoxia, there were decreases in fetal arterial oxygen saturation [from 62.7 ± 2.2 to 30.9 ± 2.9% (SE)] and PO2 (from 21.1 ± 1.0 to 14.1 ± 0.9 mmHg) (n = 7). Fetal arterial pH decreased maximally by 0.04 ± 0.01 at 6 h and returned to control thereafter. Fetal swallowing decreased from 13.4 ± 2.1 to 0.6 ± 0.2 ml · h-1 · kg fetal wt-1 with the onset of hypoxia and gradually increased, but only to one-half control levels, during the last 12 h of hypoxia. Fetal urine flow gradually decreased from 9.6 ± 1.6 ml · h-1 · kg-1 to a minimum of 5.3 ± 0.5 ml · h-1 · kg-1 at 2-3 h of hypoxia and returned to control thereafter. During the first hour of the recovery period, fetal swallowing transiently increased to twice control levels before returning to control. This was followed by a delayed, transient increase in urine flow to 63% above control levels at 2-6 h after hypoxia. We conclude that the fetal swallowing and urine flow responses to prolonged hypoxia in the absence of acidemia are distinctly different from the initial inhibitory responses, in that swallowing partially and urine flow fully recovers from the initial suppression.

AB  - The sleep patterns of 35 in vitro fertilization (IVF) children aged 19 to 57 months and their matched controls were evaluated by actigraphic home‐monitoring for three consecutive nights. Actigraphic data were analysed by an automated scoring procedure developed in the authors' laboratory. There were no significant differences in activity levels between IVF multiple‐birth subjects and their matched controls or between IVF singletons and their matched controls. In contrast, multiple‐birth subjects had higher activity levels during sleep and lower sleep efficiency than singletons in both IVF and control groups. Sleep measures showed night‐to‐night stability in all groups.

AB  - The impairment of sleep quality is a common complaint during pregnancy. To investigate the changes in sleep in the course of pregnancy, the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded and analyzed in nine healthy women on 2 consecutive nights during each trimester of pregnancy. Waking after sleep onset increased from the second (TR2) to the third (TR3) trimester, whereas rapid eye movement (REM) sleep decreased from the first trimester (TR1) to TR2. Spectral analysis of the EEG in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep revealed a progressive reduction of power density in the course of pregnancy. In comparison to TR1, the values in TR2 were significantly lower in the 10.25-11.0-Hz and 14.25-17.0-Hz bands. In TR3, the significant reduction extended over the ranges of 1.25-12.0 Hz and 13.25-16.0 Hz. The largest decrease (30%) occurred in the 14.25-15.0-Hz band. In REM sleep, the spindle frequency range was not affected, and a minor reduction of power density in some frequency bins below 12 Hz was present only in TR3. The study documents major alterations of the sleep EEG that are not evident from the sleep scores and that may be associated with the characteristic hormonal changes occurring during pregnancy.

Pineal Res. 1994: 16: 10–17. Recent studies demonstrated that melatonin treatment decreased the growth of mammary glands in pubertal and pregnant mice. In vitro, melatonin inhibited murine mammary gland growth at μM concentrations and increased it at pM concentrations. Melatonin‐induced changes of cyclic nucleotide synthesis was also demonstrated in mammary gland slices in vitro. The objective of the present study was to assess the possible existence of specific binding sites for melatonin in murine mammary gland by using 2‐[125I]‐iodomelatonin as a probe. The specific binding of 2‐[125I]‐iodomelatonin to murine mammary gland membranes was rapid, saturable, and reversible, showed an affinity in the low nM range, and displayed time, temperature, and pH dependence. Scatchard analysis indicated the existence of a single class of binding sites that exhibited a diurnal rhythmicity in affinity (Kd) and receptor density (Bmax). A maximum in Bmax (267 ± 42 fmol/mg protein) was found at the light period, while affinity was maximal during darkness (Kd= 1.33 ± 0.22 nM). In competition studies dopamine and dopamine‐related agents, as well as 6‐hydroxymelatonin and serotonin, but not melatonin, effectively displaced 2‐[125I]‐iodomelatonin from mammary binding sites. The results demonstrated a specific binding of 2‐[125I]‐iodomelatonin to murine mammary glands, with affinity in the low nM range, and a pharmacological profile that differed from that reported for 2‐[125I]‐iodomelatonin acceptor sites in other tissues.

AB  - Surveys of the Australian sea lion Neophoca cinerea were conducted throughout its range in Western and South Australia between December 1987 and February 1992. Almost every island was visited between Houtman Abrolhos and The Pages (n = 255), many of them more than once. Sea lions breed on at least 50 islands, 27 in Western Australia and 23 in South Australia. Of the 50 breeding sites, 31 have not been reported previously. A further 19 islands may also support breeding colonies. A total of 1,941 pups was counted and pup production was estimated at 2,432. Only five colonies produced more than 100 pups each and they accounted for almost half of the pup production. Most of these colonies are near Kangaroo Island, South Australia. A breeding cycle of 17–18 months has been reported for N. cinerea at Kangaroo Island and on the west coast of Western Australia; this was also noted at another 11 islands where repeated visits coincided with breeding. No evidence was found for breeding seasons shorter or longer than 17–18 months. The breeding season was not synchronized between islands, as it is in other pinnipeds. A predictive model is developed to estimate the population size from pup production figures. It indicates that pup numbers should be multiplied by between 3.81 and 4.81 to estimate the total population size just before the pupping season begins. This leads to estimates of 9,300–11,700 for the total population, considerably greater than earlier estimates. Causes of the unique reproductive cycle of N. cinerea are unknown, but we hypothesize that it results from living in a temperate climate in some of the most biologically depauperate waters of the world. It is also clear that day length and water temperature cannot act as exogenous cues for implantation of the blastocyst; the physiological events of gestation must, rather, be cued endogenously. 1994 The Zoological Society of London

AB  - The response of prolactin (PRL) and that of the pituitary-testicular axis to inhibitory photoperiods were compared in immature and young adult hamsters. In the first experiment, 14-day-old hamsters were transferred from 14L:10D to 12L:12D or 8L:16D. At 21, 28, 35, and 49 days of age, body weights, testes weights, and plasma LH were similar in all groups. In contrast, the levels of PRL were lower in animals on 8L:16D or 12L:12D than in those on 14L:10D at 35 and 49 days of age. In a second experiment, 80- day-old hamsters were transferred from 14L:10D to either 12L:12D or 8L:16D. At 5-wk intervals, they were weighed and bled by cardiocentesis and the length of the testes was measured. Photoperiods of 12L:12D and 8L:16D induced testicular regression, which was complete by 15 wk. Thereafter, augmented levels of FSH preceded spontaneous recrudescence of the testes in animals on both photoperiods. Serum PRL levels were significantly depressed within 5 wk after transfer to either 8L:16D or 12L:12D. After 15 wk as the testes were increasing in size in both groups, circulating PRL levels increased in animals exposed to 8L:16D, whereas in animals exposed to 12L:12D, PRL remained at or below the sensitivity of the assay. In a final experiment, on the day before parturition, pregnant hamsters were transferred to either 6L:18D, 6L:30D, 6L:42D, or 6L:54D or were held on 14L:10D. There were no differences in testicular weights, plasma LH, or plasma thyroxine (T4) of the pups from these dams at 21, 36, or 48 days of age. On the other hand, PRL levels at these ages were elevated in the 6L:30D and the 6L:54D groups as compared to the 6L:18D and the 6L:42D groups. The results suggest that the response of PRL to photoperiod may be experimentally dissociated from that of the hypothalamo-pituitary-testis axis to photoperiod. Like the response of the reproductive system in the adult the response of PRL incorporates a circadian oscillator in the system that measures day length.

AB  - The position adopted during sleep by 52 pregnant women and 31 age‐matched nonpregnant control subjects was studied. The pregnant group were all beyond the 30th week of gestation. In the pregnant group, 40 (77%) adopted a left tilt, 11 (21%) a right tilt and one (2%) was supine. In the control group, eight (26%) adopted a left tilt, 10 (32%) a right tilt, 12 (39%) were supine and one (3%) was prone. Closer analysis of the position adopted by the pregnant group showed: 33 adopted a full left 90° tilt, five a left 60° tilt, two a left 30° tilt, 11 adopted a full 90° right tilt and only one was supine. There was a significant difference between the sleeping positions of the pregnant and the control groups (p < 0.001). The majority of the pregnant group adopted a sleeping position that reduced the likelihood of aortocaval compression syndrome. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Although sleep disturbance is commonly reported in pregnancy, there have been few studies on sleep characteristics in pregnancy. In this study, all women attending the antenatal clinic at Sapporo Medical College Hospital for 1 month during autumn and 3 months during winter were surveyed with a questionnaire and sleep log. Of the 192 patients, 169 (88.0% stated that sleep was altered from their usual experience. A principal components analysis identified three sleep factors from the ten items in the measure of sleep used (Sleep Log). The three factors were: Sleep Duration and Quality, Insomnia and Daytime Alertness. Although no significant differences across trimesters were found on the three sleep factors, Sleep Duration and Quality, and Insomnia were worst during the first trimester. Sleep normalized in the second trimester, but the third trimester was characterized by increased Insomnia and decreased Daytime Alertness. The most frequent reasons cited by women for sleep alterations were urinary frequency, backache or ache in the hips and fetal movement. Contingency χ2analyses were used to investigate a relationship between the frequency of reporting the reasons and the trimester of pregnancy. Significant increases were found in reporting as the reasons for sleep difficulties, fetal movement in the third trimester, and heartburn, nausea and vomiting in the first trimester. The description of sleep patterns during pregnancy has clinical relevance as sleep alterations in pregnancy are common. © 1994 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - The suitability of the formic acid excretion in the urine as a parameter for the biological monitoring of inhalational exposure to formaldehyde is discussed controversially. We investigated persons not occupationally exposed to formaldehyde (n = 70) to determine possible influencing factors on the physiological excretion of formic acid. Following this we carried out a study on medical students (n = 30), who during an anatomical dissection course were exposed to a short but intensive inhalational exposure to formaldehyde, as well as investigations on employees of a pathological-anatomical laboratory (n = 8) in order to observe the course of the formic acid excretion in the urine during a working week with a continuous exposure to formaldehyde below or within the range of the MAK value (0.5 ppm). It was seen that the formic acid excretion in the urine with non-exposed persons is subject to considerable inter and intraindividual fluctuations (at a maximum by a factor of 30). In addition to differences in the endogenous formation of formates an important influencing factor is probably the uptake of food containing formic acid or its precursors. A value of 23 mg formic acid/g creatinine is given as the upper norm level (95th percentile) of adults. In the groups who were exposed to formaldehyde, in some cases considerably above the MAK value, we were able to detect no significant increase in the formic acid concentration in the urine. After a short but intensive exposure to formaldehyde (0.32-3.48 ppm) the formic acid concentration in the urine did not change significantly with an average formic acid concentration in the urine before exposure of 6.5 mg/g creatinine (central 50% range: 3.5-14.2 mg/g creat.) and after exposure of 6.0 mg/g creatinine (central 50% range: 4.4-10.9 mg/g creat.). There was no significant relationship between the individual change in the formic acid concentration in the urine (in mg/g creatinine) and the inhalational exposure to formaldehyde determined through personal air sampling (r = 0.079). In the course of a working week with a continuous exposure to formaldehyde (0.03-0.83 ppm) there was after relating the values to creatinine a continuous increase in the median to 22.3 mg/g creat. with a starting value of 8.7 mg/g creat. The change proved, however, for the number of cases investigated not to be significant. In particular there was no linear correlation detectable between the individual changes in the formic acid excretion in the urine and the formaldehyde concentrations in the breathing zone determined by personal air sampling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - This report examines the hypothesis that the characteristics of breathing activity of the fetal baboon are modulated with respect to sleep state in a fashion similar to that observed in the human fetus. The pattern of fetal breathing activity was examined in relationship to electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep state in studies of six fetuses of chronically monitored pregnant baboons at 143-148 days of gestation (term, 175-180 days). Fetal breaths were defined by fluctuations of tracheal fluid pressure. EEG sleep states were defined with an automated method for discrimination of EEG patterns that are standard indices of quiet and active sleep in immature primates. During more than 250 h of recorded data, the fetuses spent on average 33.3 ± 3.9% of time in EEG quiet sleep. In comparisons across state the fetuses spent significantly (P = 0.001) less time breathing during quiet than active sleep (49.5 ± 6.8 vs. 69.0 ± 3.8%). The inspiratory and expiratory time intervals of fetal breaths were not differentiated by EEG state but, the mean breath to breath interval was significantly (P < 0.001) longer in EEG quiet sleep. In addition to these differences in incidence and time interval of breaths, during epochs of breathing, there was a significantly slower rate, lower amplitude, and lower variability of rate of breathing in quiet sleep (all P-values < 0.02). Thus, periodic breathing activity in the fetal baboon is present in both quiet and active EEG sleep states. Sleep states have a powerful influence on patterns of fetal breathing in the non-human primate, directly comparable to the human fetus. © 1994.

AB  - Excitatory amino acid neurotransmission is an essential component of the neuroendocrine transmission line that regulates anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion. Excitatory amino acids (EAAs), such as glutamate and aspartate, are found in large concentrations in presynaptic boutons of a variety of important hypothalamic nuclei, including the arcuate nucleus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus, and the preoptic area. EAA receptors can be divided into two broad groups, namely, ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic receptors are subdivided into NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), kainate, and AMPA (DL-α-amino-3-hydroxy- 5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors. Their main mode of action is by the modulation of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ ion channels. Metabotropic receptors, on the other hand, act by a G-protein-stimulated release of intracellular Ca2+ or modulation of adenylate cyclase activity. The different EAA receptor subtypes are found in a variety of areas of the hypothalamus and the brain. In a variety of species, the administration of glutamate, NMDA, or kainate leads to LH release mediated through the stimulation of hypothalamic gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GnRH) release. The major site of NMDA action appears to be the preoptic area-where GnRH cell bodies reside. AMPA and kainate appear to act primarily at the arcuate nucleus/median eminence, the site of GnRH nerve terminals. NMDA may also act upon noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus to influence hypothalamic GnRH release. The steroid-induced LH surge in ovariectomized animals and the preovulatory surge of LH in cycling animals and in pregnant mare's serum gonadotropic-primed animals are blocked by the NMDA antagonist MK801 and the AMPA/kainate antagonist DNQX. MK801 also suppressed FSH surges in most instances, whereas DNQX had no effect on FSH surges. In the ovariectomized female rat, both the NMDA antagonist AP5 and the AMPA/kainate antagonist DNQX, lowered mean LH levels, LH pulse amplitude, and LH pulse frequency. Activation of NMDA receptors advanced the time of vaginal opening in the immature female rat, while kainate and DNQX were without effect. Gonadal steroid removal (castration) did not alter NMDA receptor levels or affinity in the hypothalamus of female or male rats. Likewise, steroid replacement to castrate rats did not affect hypothalamic NMDA receptor levels or NMDA R1 mRNA levels. Similarly, NMDA and kainate receptor levels in the hypothalamus did not change during the time of puberty in the female rat. In contrast, AMPA receptor (GluR1) immunoreactive levels in the magnocellular preoptic area (mPOA), the arcuate nucleus (ARC), and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) were found to be markedly elevated during the time of the LH surge in estradiol-progesterone-treated castrate rats compared to those of the vehicle-only-treated castrate rat. The release rates of glutamate and aspartate in the POA were found to be significantly elevated during the steroid-induced LH surge in the ovariectomized adult rat. Hence, the induction of the LH surge by steroids may involve enhanced EAA neurotransmission mediated by steroid-induced elevations in the release of glutamate and aspartate in the POA and AMPA receptors in the POA, the ARC, and the SCN. Evidence also exists supporting a role of EAAs in the release of other pituitary hormones, such as prolactin, ACTH, growth hormone, oxytocin, and vasopressin, as well as circadian rhythm induction and regulation. The above evidence points to a pivotal role of EAAs acting at the level of the hypothalamus in the neuroendocrine regulation of a variety of hormonal systems with the largest amount of data available on the control of gonadotropin secretion. © 1994 by Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Conventional wisdom and prevailing medical practice strongly support the belief that medication should be avoided during pregnancy. For the nearly one million women of childbearing age with epilepsy in the United States this is often difficult, if not impossible, and for many of these women becoming pregnant raises many conflicting issues. Women with epilepsy may face a possible increase in the frequency and severity of seizures, and in generalized tonic-clonic seizures there is a small but increased risk of miscarriage.

AB  - Objectives To establish the reproducibility of flow velocity waveforms in the human ductus venosus and to assess the influence of fetal behavioural states on these waveforms in normal term fetuses. Design Reproducibility of Doppler waveform recording and analysis was studied in 10 normal pregnancies. The relation between ductus venosus flow velocities and behavioural states was investigated in 19 other term fetuses. Time‐averaged, peak systolic, peak diastolic velocity, peak systolic/diastolic ratio and period time were calculated in both cross sectional studies. Setting Outpatient clinic, department of obstetrics (prenatal diagnosis section), Academic Hospital, Rotterdam—Dijkzigt. Subject Twenty‐nine women with normal singleton pregnancies at 36 to 39 weeks of gestation, resulting in uncomplicated births of healthy infants. Results Within‐patient coefficients of variation, ductus venosus waveform recordings were approximately 8 to 10% except for the peak systolic/diastolic ratio (4.3%). A decrease of approximately 30% was established for peak systolic, peak diastolic velocity and time‐averaged velocity during behavioural state 1F (quiet sleep) as compared with state 2F (active sleep). Conclusions Flow velocity waveform recording in the ductus venosus demonstrates acceptable reproducibility. Fetal behavioural state‐dependent changes were observed, suggesting a redistribution of umbilical venous blood through the ductus venosus shunt during the quiet sleep state.

AB  - Oxygenation produced by distending the lungs with 100% O2 increases the occurrence of arousal and fetal breathing movements (FBM), particularly during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, in fetal sheep of ≥135 days of gestation. We studied the breathing and behavioral responses to a rise in arterial PO2 (Pa(O2)) without lung distension in fetuses between 128 and 132 days of gestation. Twelve fetuses were chronically instrumented to record FBM, behavioral state blood pressure, arterial blood gas tensions, and pH. Fetal Pa(O2) was raised by having the ewe breathe 100% O2 at 3 atmosphere absolute pressure spontaneously (group 1, n = 5, 129 ± 1 days of gestation) or with mechanical ventilation to control fetal arterial PCO2 (group 2, n = 7, 131 ± 1 days of gestation). Hyperbaric oxygenation raised fetal Pa(O2) by 20 Torr in both groups. During hyperbaric oxygenation, the occurrence of arousal increased severalfold in both groups. The occurrence of FBM increased during arousal in both groups, during rapid-eye-movement sleep in group 1, and during NREM sleep in group 2. The timing of diaphragmatic activity during arousal and the variability of diaphragmatic activity during NREM sleep were different than those in rapid-eye-movement sleep. We conclude that oxygenation without lung distension increases the occurrence of arousal and of FBM, principally during arousal and NREM sleep, in fetuses of ≤135 days of gestation.

AB  - Mothers in postpartum periods are forced to be awake at night in order to take care of their babies. It is important to investigate relationships between the sleep patterns of postpartum mothers and their babies' activities under conditions in daily life to determine effects on their health. In this study, changes in sleep parameters of young women from late pregnancy to the 6th postpartum week were studied using the ambulatory EEG monitoring system. Subjects were 10 primiparae, aged 23-31 yrs (mean age of 26.8 yrs), who had a normal course of pregnancy and delivery. EEG, EMG, EOG and ECG of the mothers and their babies' actigrams from legs during sleep were simultaneously recorded using Medilog 9000 at home at four points: during late pregnancy (36 weeks), and the 1st, 3rd and 6th postpartum weeks. In the late pregnancy period, mean sleep efficiency for the 10 subjects was 94.5%, and mean total sleep time was 368.8 min. We compared the sleep parameters of four points using a two-way analysis of variance (point x subject). Total sleep time showed no significant differences among the four points (postpartum 1st week: 336.8 min, 3rd: 314.2 min, 6th:312.6 min.). Percent of waking time after sleep onset in the 1st postpartum week (21.1%) significantly increased compared with late pregnancy (5.4%), but did not change through the 3rd (19.7%) and 6th week (20.7%). The percent of stage 3 + 4 and stage REM did not change across the four points, but the percent of stage 2 in the postpartum period (1st week: 39.7%, 3rd: 41.2%, 6th: 41.0%) significantly decreased compared with late pregnancy (59.6%). There were no significant differences in the number of awakening among the four points. In conclusion, wakefulness after sleep onset during postpartum period increased compared with late pregnancy. The mothers' sleep pattern did not change through the 1st, 3rd and 6th postpartum weeks. These findings suggested strongly that their sleep was interrupted by their babies' activities, as shown in another abstract.

AB  - ABSTRACT: By identifying a change in fetal activity state, fetal movement counting may help to reduce the possibility of stillbirth. Concern has arisen that such a focus on fetal activity may cause undue maternal anxiety. A prospective, controlled trial was conducted to determine whether fetal movement counting induced anxiety or other deleterious psychological effects in low‐risk primigravidas. A sample of 613 healthy pregnant women was randomly assigned at 28 weeks' gestation to fetal movement counting, sleep recording, or a nonrecording control group. State and trait of anxiety, belief in sources of personal control, and attitudes toward pregnancy and infant were assessed at 28 and 37 weeks' gestation. Participation rates were high (91.4%) across all groups. Most women (90%) assigned to count fetal movements did so on a daily basis (95% of days). No significant changes in psychological status occurred in the three groups as a result of self‐monitoring conditions. Independent of group assignment, all women showed a slight increase in transient state and decrease in trait of anxiety from 28 to 37 weeks. Internal locus of control and positive attitudes toward the infant increased slightly, and feelings of well‐being decreased slightly for all women. It was concluded that women are willing to record fetal activity, and that fetal movement counting does not cause deleterious psychological effects in low‐risk pregnant women.

AB  - Differences in state-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral values are described between groups of preterm and full-term neonates at comparable postconceptional term ages. Eighteen healthy preterm neonates of ≤32 weeks gestation were selected from an inborn population of a neonatal intensive care unit. Twenty-four-channel recordings were obtained at a full- term age and compared with studies of 22 healthy full-term neonates. The initial three hours of each 12-hour study were recorded on paper from which EEG sleep state scores per minute were visually assessed. Six mean spectral values (i.e. total EEG, electromyogram, delta, theta, alpha and beta energies) were calculated from each corresponding minute of digitized data, which was also assigned one of six EEG sleep states. Each neonatal group displayed statistically significant differences among sleep-state segments for all spectral values. The alpha- and beta-range spectral values of the preterm group, compared to the full-term control group, were lower during all sleep state segments. Spectral values for the theta band were lower during both quiet sleep segments only, whereas spectral values for delta were lower during all sleep stages, except trace-alternant quiet sleep. Significant differences in EEG spectral values were noted among states of sleep for both preterm and full-term infants of similar postconceptional term ages. These data also suggest differences in central nervous system maturation between neonatal populations. These findings strengthen our previously stated contention that there is a functional alteration in brain development of the preterm infant as reflected in sleep organization that results from a prolonged extrauterine experience and/or prematurity.

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to calculate vagal tone (V) for 17 normal human fetuses in quiet sleep (QS) between 36 and 40 weeks gestation. The fetal cardiac electrical signal was captured transabdominally in 3‐min blocks at a rate of 833 times per second and fetal R‐waves were extracted using adaptive signal processing techniques. Fetal R‐wave interbeat intervals were converted to equally spaced, time‐based data, and the low‐frequency component was removed using a 21‐point third‐order moving polynomial. The parameter V was calculated by taking the natural logarithm of the sum of the power densities between 0.3 Hz and 1.3 Hz. We found that fetal breathing was associated with an approximately 25% increase in V as compared to nonbreathing, 3.33 ± 0.48 versus 2.57 The Official Journal of the International Society for Developmental Psychobiology 0.47, p < 0.0001. Furthermore, there was a significant linear relationship between the mean single‐fetus V during spontaneous respiration and the mean single‐fetus V during normally occurring apneic periods, r = 0.772, p < 0.002. We conclude that respiratory activity is associated with a significant increase in vagal tone for normal human fetuses in QS.©1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Copyright © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - In the present review, we have examined the effects of coffee ingestion on fertility, reproduction, lactation and development. The potential effects of coffee consumption on fertility, spontaneous abortion and prematurity are not clearly established but appear to be quite limited. In rodents, caffeine can induce malformations but this effect appears in general at doses never encountered in humans. Indeed, as soon as the quantity of caffeine is divided over the day, as is the case for human consumption, the teratogenic effect of caffeine disappears in rodents. Coffee ingested during gestation induces a dose-dependent decrease in birth weight, but usually only when ingested amounts are high (i.e. more than 7 cups/day), whereas coffee has no effect at moderate doses. Caffeine consumption during gestation affects hematologic parameters of the new-born infant or rat. In animals, caffeine induces long-term consequences on sleep, locomotion, learning abilities, emotivity and anxiety, whereas, in children, the effects of early exposure to coffee and caffeine on behavior are not clearly established. The quantities of caffeine found in maternal milk vary with authors, but it appears clearly that caffeine does not change maternal milk composition and has a tendency to stimulate milk production. In conclusion to this review, it appears that maternal coffee or caffeine consumption during gestation and/or lactation does not seem to have measurable consequences on the fetus of the newborn, as long as ingested quantities remain moderate. Therefore, pregnant mothers should be advised to limit their coffee and caffeine intake to 300 mg caffeine/day (i.e. 2-3 cups of coffee or 2.5-3 l of coke) especially because of the increase of caffeine half-life during the third trimester of pregnancy and in the neonate.

AB  - Spontaneous breathing movements are present during fetal life and they are important for normal development of the lung. Early in gestation they seem to represent free-running activity of the respiratory centers, not controlled by peripheral mechanisms but probably dependent on a tonic CO<inf>2</inf> drive. Maturation of sleep states brings into play powerful brainstem inhibitory mechanisms which control FBM. At birth these mechanisms must be overridden to allow the establishment of continuous breathing. © 1994 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - To assess the influence of intrauterine growth retardation on heart rate (HR) and HR variability during sleep, we performed polygraphic recordings in 10 small-for-gestational age (SGA) and 16 appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) newborns. Both groups were clinically and neurologically normal and were at 37 to 41 wk conceptional age. RR intervals were analyzed using the short-time Fourier transform in three frequency bands: 7) high frequency, with a period 3-8 heartbeat; 2) mid frequency, with a period 10-25 heartbeat; and 3) low frequency, with a period 30-100 heartbeat. In both active and quiet sleep, SGA newborns significantly differed from AGA newborns by having a shorter RR interval (p < 0.01) and lower amplitude of HR variability in all bands (p < 0.05) except low frequency in quiet sleep. Quiet sleep differed from active sleep by having a longer RR interval (p < 0.05), higher high-frequency variability (p < 0.02) in both SGA and AGA newborns, and lower low-frequency variability (p < 0.005 for AGA newborns). Our data give evidence of clear modifications of both sympathetic and parasympathetic HR control in the at-risk SGA population. Similarity of between-state characteristics suggests maintained CNS control of HR in SGA as well as in AGA newborns. We speculate that between-group HR and HR variability differences may be related to augmented metabolic rate in SGA compared with AGA newborns. © 1994 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Synopsis Valproic acid, a simple branched-chain fatty acid, was originally developed for the treatment of epilepsy, but also has mood-stabilising, anxiolytic, antimigraine and antinociceptive effects, and has been evaluated in the management of various other disorders, particularly psychiatric conditions. Valproic acid has been shown to be effective in patients with bipolar and schizoaffective disorders, including those resistant to lithium and carbamazepine. Response was achieved in approximately 50 to 70% of patients treated with valproic acid monotherapy for acute manic episodes in noncomparative and placebo-controlled studies. Long term prophylaxis against recurrent manic and depressive episodes has been demonstrated in approximately 65 to 70% of patients receiving the drug as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs in non-comparative studies. Moreover, valproic acid appears to be effective in rapid-cycling patients and those with mixed or dysphoric mania or neurological abnormalities, who tend to respond poorly to lithium. Evidence from preliminary studies and case reports suggests that valproic acid may prove useful for management of other psychiatric conditions, including panic attacks and aggressive behaviour. Valproic acid was found to provide prophylaxis against migraine with or without aura, and also showed promise in the treatment of acute migraine attacks, and as prophylaxis against refractory chronic daily headache. Preliminary findings suggest that valproic acid may be of value in the management of severe refractory pain, including trigeminal neuralgia, lancinating pain, and neuropathic pain associated with advanced cancer. Valproic acid is generally well tolerated, does not induce hepatic drug metabolism and has a low propensity for interactions with psychotropic agents. However, as has been observed with several other antiepileptic drugs, it is teratogenic and can cause elevated hepatic enzyme levels and rare, fatal hepatotoxicity. Weight gain and alopecia are relatively common. Thus, while few comparative data are available, valproic acid has demonstrated considerable potential as a first-line therapy for the management of bipolar or schizoaffective disorder, particularly for patients resistant to, or intolerant of, lithium or carbamazepine and those with rapid cycling or mixed mania. It has also shown potential in the treatment of refractory migraine and other types of chronic headache. Further studies are warranted in other psychiatric conditions, including panic attacks, and in severe refractory pain. Pharmacology In addition to its anticonvulsant activity, valproic acid has demonstrated anxiolytic, mood-stabilising, antimigraine and antinociceptive effects. These activities appear to be mediated, at least in part, by its effects on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -mediated neurotransmission. Valproic acid increases CNS concentrations of GABA, possibly by increasing its synthesis and/or inhibiting its catabolism. Valproic acid has also been reported to decrease neurotransmission by the excitatory amino acids γ-hydroxybutyric, aspartic and glutamic acids, to inhibit cell firing induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate, and to exert a direct neuronal membrane depressant effect, via modulation of sodium and potassium conductance. Moreover, it may also modulate noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. Valproic acid has also been reported to alter circadian rhythms in animals, possibly via effects on GABAergic functions, and this may be important in its mood-stabilising and antimigraine effects. As with other antiepileptic drugs, valproic acid has been shown to adversely affect psychomotor performance, but it appears to cause less psychomotor and cognitive impairment than phenobarbital (phenobarbitone) or phenytoin. Oral formulations of valproic acid are almost completely absorbed after administration, and dose-proportional peak plasma concentrations are attained within 1 to 3 hours (uncoated tablets), 3 to 5 hours (enteric-coated tablets) or 5 to 10 hours (controlled-release tablets). Administration with food decreases the rate, but not the extent, of absorption. Maximum plasma concentrations range from 25 to 100 mg/L following administration of 250 to 1000mg doses, in uncoated tablet or capsule form. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) is small (0.1 to 0.4 L/kg) and plasma protein binding is approximately 90% in healthy persons, although the unbound proportion increases at total plasma valproic acid concentrations >80 mg/L. Metabolism occurs by at least 5 major pathways, and the drug is eliminated by renal and faecal routes, mostly (97%) in metabolised form. Plasma clearance ranges from 0.4 to 0.6 L/h, and plasma elimination half-life (t½β) from 9 to 16 hours, in healthy volunteers. Plasma clearance of valproate is enhanced by coadministration with hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs, resulting in decreased t½β. Plasma protein binding was decreased in pregnancy and in patients with impaired renal function or diabetes mellitus, while decreased clearance of unbound valproate was noted in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. The t½β, Vd and proportion of unbound valproate were increased in neonates, while plasma clearance was increased and t½β decreased in children. In the elderly, unbound valproate concentrations were increased, as a result of decreased clearance and plasma protein binding. Therapeutic Potential Valproic acid has been shown to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with bipolar and schizoaffective disorders, including those resistant to lithium and carbamazepine. When given alone or (more commonly) in combination with other agents in noncomparative studies, it provided prophylaxis against recurrent manic and depressive episodes for prolonged periods in approximately 65 to 70% of patients. A small number of comparative and noncomparative studies have shown that valproic acid monotherapy is effective in controlling acute manic episodes in approximately 50 to 70% of patients, and efficacy comparable to that of lithium was demonstrated in one double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 179 patients. Moreover, oral loading to reach therapeutic concentrations within 24 hours achieved control of acute mania within 5 days. Valproic acid was more effective in mania than depression, and appeared particularly effective in patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, dysphoric or mixed mania, electro-encephalographic abnormalities or psychiatric illness following closed head injury. Evidence from preliminary studies and case reports suggests that valproic acid may prove useful in the treatment of other psychiatric disorders, including panic attacks and aggressive behaviour. In several studies, mostly in small numbers of patients, valproic acid provided prophylaxis against migraine with or without aura, including that resistant to standard therapies, decreasing the frequency of attacks versus baseline or placebo. Valproic acid was also reported to be effective in 58% of acute migraine attacks, and to provide prophylaxis against refractory chronic daily headache in 2 small noncomparative studies. Preliminary data, mostly from nonblinded case series, suggest that valproic acid may prove useful in the management of severe refractory pain, including trigeminal neuralgia, lancinating pain and neuropathic pain associated with advanced cancer. Tolerability The majority of tolerability data on valproic acid are derived from patients receiving the drug for management of epilepsy. However, the pattern of adverse events appears similar in epileptic and nonepileptic indications. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal disturbances (dyspepsia, nausea, anorexia, particularly at the start of therapy), weight gain, CNS effects (tremor, drowsiness, ataxia) and transient hair loss. Enteric coated formulations of valproic acid are associated with a considerably lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events (3 to 6% of patients) than uncoated preparations. Elevated liver enzymes and hyperammonaemia are relatively common in patients receiving valproic acid, but are not usually clinically significant. However, fatal hepatotoxicity, which is more common in patients <2 years old, and those receiving polytherapy, occurs rarely. Other serious adverse events include haemorrhagic pancreatitis, which is sometimes fatal, and haematological disorders (thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, disturbance of platelet function). Use of valproic acid during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of birth defects, particularly spina bifida, as observed with several other antiepileptic agents. Drug Interactions Valproic acid can increase the plasma concentrations of coadministered drugs by inhibiting their metabolism and/or by displacement from plasma protein binding sites. Such interactions have been reported to occur between valproic acid and phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, felbamate, diazepam and warfarin. Coadministration of drugs that induce hepatic drug metabolism (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone) can decrease plasma concentrations of valproic acid. Adjustment of valproic acid dosage may therefore be necessary when such drugs are initiated or withdrawn. Salicylates increase free and total plasma valproate concentrations by inhibition of valproate metabolism and displacement of valproate from plasma binding sites. In contrast with other antiepileptic agents, valproic acid does not impair the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Dosage and administration Enteric-coated and controlled-release preparations of valproic acid are usually Administration administered once or twice daily, and uncoated tablets 3 to 4 times daily. Tablets or capsules should be swallowed whole with or after food, in order to minimise gastrointestinal disturbance. Valproic acid is usually initiated at a low dosage (e.g. 500 to 1000 mg/day), which is titrated upwards until response is achieved or dose-limiting adverse events are noted. However a higher initial dose of 20 mg/kg/day was effective and well tolerated for achieving control of acute manic episodes in hospitalised patients. Plasma valproate concentrations of approximately 50 to 100 mg/L are generally required to achieve a good therapeutic effect. Valproic acid should not be given to patients with hepatic disease or significant hepatic dysfunction. Patients aged ≤2 years and/or receiving cotherapy with several antiepileptic drugs are at increased risk of developing hepatotoxicity, as are those with genetic disorders of metabolism (carnitine or ornithine carbamoyl-transferase deficiency, family history of severe hepatic disease), or severe epilepsy associated with cerebral lesions, mental retardation or other hereditary pathology. Elderly patients may require a lower dosage of valproic acid. Dosage adjustments based on total plasma drug concentrations should be made with caution in the elderly and patients with renal dysfunction or uncompensated diabetes mellitus, as the unbound fraction of valproic acid is increased in such patients. Use of valproic acid during pregnancy should be avoided if possible, because of an increased risk of neural tube defects. Platelet count and coagulation parameters should be monitored before therapy, at periodic intervals during therapy, and before elective surgery in patients receiving valproic acid. © 1994, Adis International Limited.

AB  - Continuous infusion of cortisol into adrenalectomized fetal sheep during the last 72 h of gestation (term = 145 ± 2 days) produced a significant (P&lt;0.05) rise in fetal serum in iodothyronine (T3) mean ± S.E.M. concentrations from 398±65 to 1340±238 ng/l. A concurrent decrease in plasma thyroxine (T4) levels was observed in three out of four animals. No significant changes in the concentrations of either hormone were noted prior to the start of cortisol infusion. The plasma concentrations of cortisol, T3 and T4 at term were similar to those in untreated full-term lambs. Adrenalectomized fetuses not given cortisol infusions still had low levels of T3 at term, with no increase being observed. The results suggest that cortisol plays an important role in the increase of fetal plasma T3 observed towards the end of gestation. This is probably achieved by the stimulation of the monodeiodination of T4 to T3 in the peripheral tissues.

AB  - Narcolepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, and other rapid-eye-movement (REM)-sleep phenomena such as sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. Although stimulants are the only effective treatment for the sleepiness of narcolepsy, no clinical guidelines on the use of stimulants in the treatment of narcolepsy have been published that address the following factors: appropriate doses; development of tolerance; potential for side effects, adverse reactions and abuse; and use in children and pregnant or breast- feeding women. These practice parameters from the American Sleep Disorders Association provide the first clinical guidelines on the appropriate use of stimulants in the treatment of narcolepsy.

AB  - Study Objective: To document the effects of compromised respiratory function on oxygen saturation (SpO2) after cesarean section via the telemetric pulse oximetry network (TPON) for 24 continuous hours. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Postpartum ward of a university hospital. Patients: ASA physical status I or II parturients undergoing cesarean section. Interventions: Healthy parturients were assigned to 1 of 3 anesthetic-postoperative morphine regimens as follows: general anesthesia-parenteral morphine as needed (GA/PM; n = 11); epidural anesthesia-parenteral morphine as needed (EA/PM; n = 15); epidural anesthesia-epidural morphine 4 to 5 mg (EA/EM; n = 10). Measurements and Main Results: For 24 continuous hours after cesarean section, SpO2, heart rate, and plethysmogram every 10 seconds were recorded by the TPON computer. In addition, pain, somnolence, respiratory rate (RR), and side effects were recorded every 30 minutes to 2 hours. SpO2 less than 94% and less than 92% occurred least with GA/PM. The highest mean cumulative time of SpO2 between 95% and 90% occurred with EA/EM. The longest episode of SpO2 less than 92% and the lowest SpO2 for more than 1 minute also occurred with EA/EM. With all 3 regimens, SpO2 decreased to less than 80% for 20 to 30 seconds at a time, but the lowest SpO2 (less than 85%) for more than 1 minute occurred with EA/EM in 1 patient and was associated with somnolence that required treatment. With all 3 regimens, average RR was within normal limits, but mean RR was significantly lower with EA/EM than with GA/PM or EA/PM from the 8th to the 14th postoperative hours. Somnolence did not differ significantly among the 3 regimens. Pain score was significantly lower with EA/EM than with GA/PM or EA/PM for the first 20 hours. Conclusions: All 3 regimens risked low SpO2, with the EA/EM regimen having the highest risk but the best analgesia. Neither general nor epidural anesthesia combined with postoperative parenteral morphine influenced SpO2 postoperatively. In this study, the TPON provided a feasible method of detecting hypoxemia early on in the general ward setting. © 1994.

AB  - Objective. To investigate the effect of prenatal smoking on infant respiratory behavior during sleep. Methods. A questionnaire concerning family habits and infants' history was completed for 550 healthy infants before a 9- hour night polysomnographic study. Because the data for 41 infants were not available for analysis, 509 subjects were studied: 115 were newborns evaluated within 1 week after birth, and 394 were healthy infants admitted at 11 weeks of life (range 5 to 29 weeks) after various research protocols. Results. According to the smoking frequency of the mothers during pregnancy, the subjects were defined as 'nonsmokers' (no cigarette smoked during pregnancy; n = 400), 'light smokers' (1 to 9 cigarettes per day; n = 37), or 'smokers' (10 or more cigarettes per day; n = 72). Compared with nonsmokers and light smokers, 'smoking' mothers had a significant increase in the number of episodes of uterine bleeding during the pregnancy. Their infants had lower birth weights and more frequent episodes of profuse sweating during sleep. Infants of smokers also had more frequent and longer obstructive sleep apneas than those of the two other groups. For infants of smokers the relative risk for obstructive apneas was 2.76 (95% confidence interval: 1.63 to 4.69; P = .001) The relation between prenatal smoking and postnatal manifestation of obstructive sleep apneas demonstrated a dose-response pattern. Paternal smoking during pregnancy increased the risk of obstructive apneas only in the infants of smoking mothers, but not in those of the two other groups. Maternal smoking after birth did not add significantly to the risk of obstructive apneas. The effect of smoking was seen in older infants, as well as in the newborns not yet exposed to ambient cigarette smoke. A stepwise logistic regression, using obstructive sleep apneas as the dependent variable identified three significant independent variables: smoking during pregnancy (P = .001), profuse sweating during sleep (P = .001), and birth weight (P = .010). No explanation was found for the effect of prenatal smoking on obstructive sleep apneas. Conclusion. Prenatal smoking by mothers correlated with an increase in frequency and length of obstructive apneas and a decrease in birth weight of their infants. The infants were under greater risk for obstructive apnea if both parents smoked. Explanations for our results are unknown to us, but these findings may be of interest in the study of infant breathing behavior and epidemiological characteristics of sudden infant death syndrome.

AB  - Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a clinical manifestation of the parasympathetic nervous system which can be identified in the high-frequency region of the heart rate variability (HRV) power spectrum. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative contribution of RSA to overall HRV for human fetuses in quiet sleep. The study population consisted of 13 normal human fetuses between 36 and 40 weeks of gestation for whom data were collected during spontaneous breathing and normally occurring apneic periods. Fetal breathing was monitored continuously using real-time sonography. The fetal electrocardiogram was captured transabdominally in 3-min blocks at a rate of 833 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted from the raw signal using adaptive signal processing techniques. Fetal behavioral state was determined at the beginning and end of each 3-min data collection period. The fetal R-wave interbeat intervals (IBIs) were converted to equally-spaced, time-based data, and linear detrending of the time series was accomplished by subtracting the mean heart period from each weighted IBI. Total power (TP, 0.0-2.5 Hz) was divided into RSA (0.4-1.0 Hz), high-frequency (HF, 0.2-2.5 Hz), low-frequency (LF, 0.04-0.2 Hz), and very-low-frequency (VLF 0.0-0.04 Hz) regions, and the power densities were summed to determine the absolute power for each frequency component. A total of 81 3 min blocks (mean per subject 6.3, range 2-14) were available for analysis. Eleven (85%) of 13 fetuses demonstrated at HF peak during fetal breathing, and RSA accounted for approximately 20% of the TP. Although HF amplitude was reduced in the absence of fetal respiratory activity, RSA did not invariably disappear during periods of apnea, as the HF peak was recognized in seven (54%) fetuses when no respiratory activity was observed. Total power was approximately evenly distributed between the VLF, LF, and HF regions, and this distribution was independent of whether the fetus was breathing or not. However, the absolute power was significantly greater (P < 0.05) during breathing as compared to non-breathing for TP and for the VLF, LF, HF, and RSA components. We conclude that RSA is common in normal human fetuses and is a significant factor contributing to HRV. © 1994.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intermittent sinusoidal heart rate pattern, an early indicator of fetal anemia, has been speculated to have a positive correlation with fetal sleep cycles. To test this hypothesis, intermittent sinusoidal heart rate patterns were produced experimentally with arginine vasopressin in six methylatropinized fetal lambs that were demonstrating clear rapid-eye-movement and non-rapid-eye-movement sleep cycling. STUDY DESIGN: Eleven trials of arginine vasopressin infusion (40 to 160 mIU per body per minute) were performed on each of six chronically instrumented fetal lambs subsequent to parasympathetic blocking doses of methylatropine (300 to 400 μg). An intermittent sinusoidal heart rate pattern was observed in relation to fetal sleep cycles. RESULTS: Alteration between rapid-eye-movement and non-rapid-eye-movement sleep was observed in methylatropinized fetuses. In the six fetuses that showed intermittent sinusoidal heart rate patterns subsequent to arginine vasopressin infusion, the fetal heart rate tracing and fetal electrocorticogram demonstrated alternate sinusoidal pattern and reactive heart rate patterns during high- and low-voltage electrocorticogram activity, respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that fetal sleep cycling has a positive correlation with the periodic appearance of intermittent sinusoidal heart rate patterns.

AB  - Objective To examine the behavioural state dependency of renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility index and hourly fetal urinary production rate (HFUPR) in the normal term fetus. Design An observational study. Subjects Twenty‐three healthy women with a normal singleton pregnancy between 36 and 40 weeks gestation. Main outcome measures Renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility indices were established using pulsed Doppler ultrasound. HFUPR (ml) was estimated using real‐time ultrasound. Fetal behavioural states 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep) were determined from combined recordings of fetal heart rate, eye movements and body movements. Results An inverse correlation between pulsatility index and fetal heart pattern was established for both the renal artery (r= 0.60; SD = 0.22; P= 0.0001) and the descending aorta (r= 0.73; SD = 0.16; P= 0.0001). The difference in mean pulsatility index between states IF and 2F adjusted for fetal heart pattern was 0.09 (SD 0.23) for the renal artery (P= 0.02) and 0.26 (SD 0.19) for the descending aorta (P= 0.0001). Mean HFUPR was significantly higher (44.8 %, P= 0.01) in state 1F (96 ml) compared with state 2F (54 ml) During the urinary filling phase, a poor correlation existed between renal artery pulsatility index and HFUPR (r= 0.04) and between descending aorta pulsatility index and HFUPR (r= 0.01). Conclusions In the normal term fetus renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility indices are reduced during fetal behavioural state 2F, suggesting reduced downstream impedance at the fetal trunk and in particular at renal level. This behavioural state is, however, also associated with reduced micturition. No correlation exists between renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility indices and fetal urinary output.

On EEG this is shown by late activation of cerebral bioelectrical processes in response to rhythmical activity, delayed organization of circadian sleep pattern, low threshold of convulsive excitability. The data obtained confirm compensatory incompetence of the brain in cesarean section newborns.

A prospective study of proneness to acute respiratory illness in the first two years of life. International Journal of Epidemiology 1994; 23: 818-826. Background. This study sought explanations for the proneness to respiratory events in young Australian children. Methods. Prospective respiratory symptom diaries on 836 children collected data on respiratory symptoms and episodes. Questionnaires to mothers and birth and pregnancy records provided 56 known and possible predictors which were tested against two summary respiratory outcomes in each of the first and second years of life. Results. The two summary respiratory variables recorded for first and second year of life give four outcome variables. In fitting multivariate regression models to predict outcomes, use of child care in early childhood and mothers’ experience of respiratory illness in the 12 months before birth were significant predictors for all four outcomes. Number of siblings was a predictor for three of the four outcomes. Sleep difficulty during pregnancy in the mother, and respiratory hospitalization of the infant in the first year, were significant predictors for both first-year outcomes. Unexpected and unexplained findings emerged for alcohol intake during pregnancy, passive smoking and breastfeeding in relation to the second year respiratory outcomes. Less than 9% of variance in outcome scores was explained in any of the four multiple regression models but this rose to between 24% and 31% when a corresponding score from the other year was added to the model. Conclusions. Proneness to respiratory illness is an important entity; its determinants are largely unknown and events in pregnancy or the perinatal period explain only a small proportion of the between-infant variability. © 1994 International Epidemiological Association.

AB  - Stability of oxygen saturation depends on maturation and function of individual components of the respiratory system. The aim of this study was to record and analyse comprehensive oxygen saturation data in a longitudinal study over the first year of life. Detailed sleep studies were performed on 15 normal infants eight times in the first year of life. The accrued oxygen saturation data were analysed on a computerized oximetry data analysis system. Results show the mean sleep saturation levels trending upwards and stabilizing by 185 days. There was an inverse curvilinear relationship between mean age and median desaturation time and the median number of desaturations at ≥95, ≥92 and ≥90% saturation. The mean cumulative desaturation time ≥90% in the first 4 months was 11.08 min (range 2.5–36.57 min). This study demonstrates monotonic patterns of increasing saturation and decreasing number and time of desaturations ≥95% and ≥90% but a random pattern of desaturations ≥85% occurs across the first 6 months of life. Cumulative desaturation times over the first 4 months of life were high and could be important to the development of maturity of the respiratory system. After 6 months, all indices of saturation and desaturation point to a stable and mature respiratory system. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Behavioural state dependent changes occur in the circulation of the normally developing human fetus at term. During fetal behavioural state 2F (active sleep), there seems to be preferential blood flow through the ductus venosus and foramen ovale into the left heart. Increased left ventricular output of well-oxygenated blood during fetal behavioural state 2F will be necessary to meet the raised energy demands both at cerebral and trunk level as demonstrated by reduced pulsatility index values in the descending aorta, renal artery and intracranial arteries during this behavioural state. The limited studies in IUGR suggest behavioural state independency in the descending aorta and internal carotid artery which may be attributed to the fetus being incapable of adjusting its circulation to the existing behavioural state in the presence of circulatory centralization. © 1994.

Participants included women who were married, employed, English-speaking, and giving birth to their first child at one of two hospitals in St Paul, Minnesota. Women who were eligible and willing to participate were mailed questionnaires at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postpartum. Results. There were significant changes in mothers' general mental health, depression, and anxiety over the first postpartum year (P ≤ .01), with least favorable outcomes at 1 month and most favorable outcomes at 12 months postpartum. Poor mental health was related to work factors, such as longer work hours and maternity leave of less than 24 weeks, and to variables often associated with recent childbirth, such as maternal fatigue, loss of sleep, concerns about appearance, and infant illnesses. In addition, postpartum symptoms were predicted by physical illness, previous mental problems, poor general health, poor social support, fewer recreational activities, young age, and low income (R2 = 37% to 57%). Conclusions. In this select group of women, postpartum mental health was found to be least favorable 1 month after delivery and related to factors associated with employment, recent delivery, and level of social support.

AB  - In Rwanda, a central African country, the prevalence of HIV infection now exceeds 30% in urban adults. This study identifies the social services and counseling needs of women who are already infected with the HIV virus, the outcome after disclosure of the woman's HIV test result to her partner and estimates the social support available to the women from their partners and relatives. Fifty-five HIV-positive women in Kagali were interviewed in 1988 and 47 of this group were interviewed again in 1991. The social services most needed by the women in 1988 were housing, employment and money. By 1991, the women prioritised food, housing and money as their current needs and food, childcare and money were their future needs in the event they became ill. The preferred sources of support in 1988 were individual counseling and women's support groups. By 1991, the preferred sources of support were individual counseling and their priest. In 1988, almost 75% of the women did not expect a supportive reaction from their partners after disclosure of the test result. In 1991, acceptance, understanding and sympathy were the most common reactions of the partners after disclosure. However, 8 (21%) had not told their partner their test result. After disclosure, 18 of the 37 partners were subsequently tested. Of those tested, 75% were HIV-positive and 25% were HIV-negative. Condom use was almost twice as high when the partner was informed of the test result, although in couples overall, a third were not using condoms despite knowing the test result. There were 23 births since 1988 and pregnancy was equally likely whether the test result was known or if the partner tested. The women overall reported good morale in 1991, bolstered by their religion. Chronic difficulties with sleep, performing daily routine and feelings of depression were reported by a third of women. Conclusions are the basic survival services are needed for affected families, and a program of testing and counseling for partners is required. © 1994.

AB  - We examined cardiac reactivity in the first 45 seconds following a single 1 second vibroacoustic stimulus (VAS) to determine if the prestimulus fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern was predictive of the immediate post-VAS heart rate response. Forty-nine normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation were observed to enter quiet sleep and remain in that state for 3 to 5 minutes before testing. In general, VAS elicited an initial acceleratory response of approximately 20 beats/min above the mean prestimulus heart rate followed by a deceleratory response to an average of approximately 4 beats/min below baseline values. Fetuses with different average prestimulus heart rate patterns generally differed in their early cardiac response to VAS: when compared to a high baseline FHR, a low resting heart rate was associated with a greater increase in heart rate above baseline (r = -0.401; P = 0.03), a greater decrease below prestimulus values (r = -0.312; P = 0.03), and a greater difference between maximum and minimum heart rates (r = -0.465; P = 0.001). Higher baseline heart rates were associated with lower FHR variability in the prestimulus period (r = -0.422; P = 0.009). When we examined the time course of the early response, we found that fetuses that achieved a maximum heart rate quickly exhibited less of an increase above prestimulus values (r = 0.894; P = 0.005), displayed a greater decrease below baseline (r = 0.507; P = 0.0002), and reached the minimum heart rate faster (r = 0.575; P = 0.0001) than fetuses that required longer to achieve a maximum cardiac response. In light of the relationship between heart rate and autonomic nervous system activity, these findings suggest that cardiac reactivity in the human fetus may reflect individual differences in resting sympathetic-parasympathetic balance. © 1994, by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Occulted hyperprolactinemia (OHP) is a clinical subtype of the hyperprolactinemia, which causes several kinds of ovulatory disturbances, sterility and galactorrhea. The same clinical disorders as in the apparent hyperprolactinemia are also observed in women with OHP, which is caused by a transient increase in prolactin. OHP is defined as transient hyperprolactinemia during sleep or in the pre-ovulatory period of the menstrual cycle, and accompanied by increased prolactin secreting capacity. Prolactin secreting capacity determined by the TRH, metoclopramide or estradiol-loading-test reveals hyperresponsiveness in OHP, while the basal level of prolactin does not show apparent hyperprolactinemia. The usefulness of bromocriptine (dopamine agonist) has been established not only in the treatment of apparent hyperprolactinemia but also in OHP. Following bromocriptine administration, 83% of OHP patients have returned to normal ovulatory cycles and 50% of them have become pregnant.

AB  - Sixty patients, scheduled for Caesarean section were randomly allocated to receive by the epidural route in a double‐blind fashion one of the following patient‐controlled analgesia mixtures for the relief of postoperative pain: sufentanil 2 μg.ml‐1 in 0.9% sodium chloride, sufentanil 2 μg.ml‐1+ adrenaline 2.5 μg.ml‐1, or sufentanil 2 μg.ml‐1+ clonidine 3 μg.ml‐1. Patient‐controlled analgesia settings were a basal infusion rate of 2.5 ml.h‐1, an incremental dose of 2.5 ml, a lockout interval of 10 min and a 1‐h limit of 10 ml. Whereas patient demographics and pain scores between the groups were not different, the 24‐h consumption of sufentanil was significantly lower in the groups receiving a combination (167.5 SD 45 and 139.1 SD 31.9 μg for the adrenaline and clonidine groups respectively) as compared to the plain sufentanil regimen (208.2 SD 38.9 μg). Although sufentanil requirements were the lowest in the clonidine admixture group, there were no differences with regard to sedation as compared to the plain sufentanil group. The quality of sleep appeared to be significantly better in the sufentanil/adrenaline group despite a significantly lower degree of sedation and higher incidence of pruritus. Treatment of pruritus with naloxone did not seem to influence the quality of analgesia. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Repeated alterations in episodes of quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS) is a basic feature of behavioral state organization in human fetuses. Activation of the reticular formation (RF) is important in the transition from QS to AS, and intrinsic changes in central nervous system (CNS) activity govern RF activation. Vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) can alter RF activation and thus delay the occurrence of QS. We hypothesize that if intrinsic RF activation in human fetuses is greatest just after entering AS and is decreasing as an AS-to-QS transition is approached, then fetuses ought to be in an active period longer if stimulated just after entering AS than if stimulated closer to an AS-to-QS transition. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis. We examined 87 normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation. Behavioral states were assigned based on fetal heart rate pattern and the presence or absence of fetal eye and gross body movements. All fetuses were observed to enter AS before being randomized to a particular group. After remaining in AS for 3 min, the fetus either was not stimulated (N = 30), received a single 1-s VAS after 3-5 min of AS (N = 30), or received a single 1-s VAS after 44-46 min of AS (N = 27). Heart rate and eye and body movements were monitored continuously until the fetus either returned to QS and remained in that state for 3 min or did not return to QS within 60 min. All 57 fetuses who were stimulated in AS responded to VAS with gross body movement and an increase in heart rate, indicating that there was no effect of prestimulus state duration on the sensitivity to VAS. Fetuses stimulated after 3-5 min of AS behaved similarly to fetuses who had entered AS spontaneously. However, fetuses who were stimulated after being in AS for 44-46 min remained in an active period for a significantly shorter length of time following VAS than fetuses who either had been in AS for 3-5 min before VAS (19.6 min versus 36.4 min, P = 0.0001) or had entered AS spontaneously (19.6 min versus 44-2 min, P = 0.0001). When we included our results from a previous study examining state organization following VAS delivered in QS, we found that stimulation of the fetus around the time of a spontaneous AS-to-QS transition elicited a significantly different behavioral response than VAS delivered around the time of a spontaneous QS-to-AS transition: regardless of whether fetuses were in AS or QS at the time of stimulation, fetuses who were stimulated in close proximity to an AS-to-QS transition returned to QS sooner than fetuses who were stimulated closer to a QS-to-AS transition (18.7 min versus 37.2 min, P = 0.0001). We conclude that underlying changes in CNS activity, which continue to occur in the absence of overt behavioral changes, place relatively strict requirements on the amount of AS and QS during fetal life. © 1994 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - Many of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal are similar to those of other drug withdrawal syndromes: anxiety, awakening during sleep, depression, difficulty concentrating, impatience, irritability/anger and restlessness. Slowing of the heart rate and weight gain are distinguishing features of tobacco withdrawal. Although nicotine withdrawal may not produce medical consequences, it lasts for several weeks and can be severe in some smokers. Like most other drug withdrawals, nicotine withdrawal is time‐limited, occurs in non‐humans, is influenced by instructions/expectancy and abates with replacement therapy and gradual reduction. Unlike some other drug withdrawal syndromes, protracted, neonatal or precipitated withdrawal does not occur. Whether nicotine withdrawal is associated with tolerance, acute physical dependence, greater duration and intensity of use, rapid reinstatement, symptom stages, cross‐dependence with other nicotine ligands, reduction by non‐pharmacological interventions and genetic influences is unclear. Whether nicotine withdrawal plays a major role in relapse to smoking has not been established but this is also true for other drug withdrawal syndromes. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - The teratogenic effect of caffeine has been clearly demonstrated in rodents. The sensitivity of different animals species is variable. Malformations have been demonstrated in mice at 50-75 mg/kg of caffeine, whereas the lowest dose usually needed to induce malformations is 80 mg/kg in rats. However, when caffeine is administered in fractioned amounts during the day, 330 mg/kg/day are necessary to reach teratogenicity in rats. In rodents, the most frequently observed malformations are those of the limbs and digits, ectrodactyly, craniofacial malformations (labial and palatal clefts) and delays in ossification of limbs, jaw and sternum. Nevertheless, even in rodents, caffeine can be considered as a weak teratogenic agent, given the quite large quantities of caffeine necessary to induce malformations and the small number of animals affected. In humans, caffeine does not present any teratogenic risk. The increased risk of the most common congenital malformations entailed by moderate consumption of caffeine is very slight. However, caffeine potentiates the teratogenic effect of other substances, such as tobacco, alcohol, and acts synergistically with ergotamine and propranolol to induce materno-fetal vasoconstrictions leading to malformations induced by ischemia. Therefore, even though caffeine does not seem to be harmful to the human fetus when intake is moderate and spread out over the day, some associations, especially with alcohol, tobacco, and vasoconstrictive or anti-migraine medications should be avoided. Maternal consumption of caffeine affects brain composition, especially in case of a low-protein diet and also seems to interfere with zinc fixation in brain. Maternal exposure to caffeine induces also long-term consequences on sleep, locomotion, learning abilities, emotivity, and anxiety in rat offspring, whereas in humans, more studies are needed to ascertain long-term behavioral effects of caffeine ingestion by pregnant mothers. © 1994.

AB  - The main actions of benzodiazepines (hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, myorelaxant and amnesic) confer a therapeutic value in a wide range of conditions. Rational use requires consideration of the large differences in potency and elimination rates between different benzodiazepines, as well as the requirements of individual patients. As hypnotics, benzodiazepines are mainly indicated for transient or short term insomnia, for which prescriptions should if possible be limited to a few days, occasional or intermittent use, or courses not exceeding 2 weeks. Temazepam, loprazolam and lormetazepam, which have a medium duration of action are suitable. Diazepam is also effective in single or intermittent dosage. Potent, short-acting benzodiazepines such as triazolam appear to carry greater risks of adverse effects. As anxiolytics, benzodiazepines should generally be used in conjunction with other measures (psychological treatments, antidepressants, other drugs) although such measures have a slower onset of action. Indications for benzodiazepines include acute stress reactions, episodic anxiety, fluctuations in generalised anxiety, and as initial treatment for severe panic and agoraphobia. Diazepam is usually the drug of choice, given in single doses, very short (1 to 7 days) or short (2 to 4 weeks) courses, and only rarely for longer term treatment. Alprazolam has been widely used, particularly in the US, but is not recommended in the UK, especially for long term use. Benzodiazepines also have uses in epilepsy (diazepam, clonazepam, clobazam), anaesthesia (midazolam), some motor disorders and occasionally in acute psychoses. The major clinical advantages of benzodiazepines are high efficacy, rapid onset of action and low toxicity. Adverse effects include psychomotor impairment, especially in the elderly, and occasionally paradoxical excitement. With long term use, tolerance, dependence and withdrawal effects can become major disadvantages. Unwanted effects can largely be prevented by keeping dosages minimal and courses short (ideally 4 weeks maximum), and by careful patient selection. Long term prescription is occasionally required for certain patients. © 1994, Adis International Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - The heart transplantation program was started in Taiwan in 1987. Now an 88% operation success rate has been achieved, with a 68.9% one-year survival rate recorded. To better understanding patients' adjustment to life after transplantation, a study was done of 30 patients. The qualitative method was used, and interviews were conducted during the period November 1992 through February 1993. Results showed that idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common first diagnosis. Infection was the leading cause of death. Most patients reported that their physical functioning, sleep and exercise were much improved following surgery. Over 86% expressed satisfaction with their current health condition. Eleven patients returned to their work, five had chosen to retire, eight planned to work or return to school. One was unable to work for medical reason. The remaining five carried on their usual lives. Factors found to negatively affect return to work included: (1) family objections; (2) personal, psychological reason; (3) age; (4) insurance problems; (5) medical restrictions. Of the 30, 77% claimed the disease had not affected marital relationships, yet 81% reported decreased sexual activity. Libido decrease was the most common postoperative problem. Factors reported as affecting sexual life were: (1) effect of drugs; (2) apprehension that sexual activity would provoke cardiac accident; (3) fear of pregnancy; (4) sex identity problem; (5) an extra-marital affair; (6) poor marital relations. Most patients showed good compliance with medical advice and had a positive attitude toward life. In summary, heart transplantation is growing in acceptance in Taiwan. Improving patient adaptation to everyday life should receive more attention, probably through education and counseling.

AB  - The general pharmacological action of 1,3-dihydro-4-methyl-5-[4-(methylsulfinyl) benzoyl]-2H-imidazol-2-one (MDL 19,438), a metabolite of enoximone, was studied. MDL 19,438 had no effect on the general behavior in rats at 10-300 mg/kg, i.v., nor did it have any effect on the spontaneous motor activity or pentobarbital-induced sleeping time in mice, or on the spontaneous electroencephalogram in cats at 3-30 mg/kg, i.v. Depending on the concentration, MDL 19,438 relaxed the isolated rabbit aorta contracted by phenylephrine (EC50: 3.1 x 10-4 M). The relaxant action was not altered by removal of the endothelium. MDL 19,438 also relaxed the intrinsic tone of the isolated guinea pig trachea (EC50: 1.9 x 10-5 M), although it slightly relaxed KCl- and carbachol-induced contractions in the trachea. These relaxant actions of MDL 19,438 on both vascular and tracheal smooth muscle were weaker than those of enoximone. MDL 19,438 had little effect on the spontaneous rhythmic contractions of the isolated rabbit ileum or the isolated uterus of pregnant or virgin rats at 3 x 10-7-3 x 10-5 M. At 10-6-10-4 M, MDL 19,438 did not affect acetylcholine-induced contractions in the guinea pig ileum, nor did it (3-30 mg/kg, i.v.) affect gastric secretion in rats. These results suggest that MDL 19,438 has no notable general pharmacological effects, except for its weak relaxant action on the vascular and tracheal smooth muscles.

AB  - Extensive placer gold deposits occur in Quaternary palaeochannels in the Ampalit and Cempaga Buang drainage basins near Kasongan, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Broad interfluvial Pleistocene terraces surrounding the drainages also contain significant amounts of placer gold. The "channel" and "terrace" gold deposits together cover an area in excess of 180 km2. Exploration for gold at Ampalit followed traditional alluvial methods, and assumed that mechanical and gravitational factors were the principal mechanisms affecting gold accumulation and concentration. Gold was considered to be physically reworked from terraces and redeposited in the present drainage channels or underlying, laterally displaced, palaeochannels. However, a comparison of gold grains from the Ampalit drainage channel and adjacent terraces indicates that gold grains in the drainage channels are possibly of colloidal origin and not mechanically transported to their present domain. The morphology of gold grains from the Ampalit drainage is compared with grains from adjacent terraces, using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The latter procedure allows for nondestructive analysis to give true three dimensional surface topography down to nanometre resolution. Evidence from force microscopy supports a colloidal origin for gold aggregates. The average purity of gold produced from the Ampalit dredging operation is 970 fine (970/1000) and the majority of examined gold grains extracted from beneath the drainage channel have a purity of 998 fine. This unusually high degree of purity suggests a selective dissolution/aggregation mechanism. We propose that gold is transported downward and laterally in groundwater percolating through the terrace sands and gravels to the current drainage as a humic acid-stabilised colloid. As the pregnant groundwater migrates toward the present drainage channels, it encounters a sleep chemical gradient and the colloid aggregates. The aggregation process occurs near clay zones within palaeochannel sands and gravels beneath the present river sediments. Here the colloidal aggregates form small grains (usually &lt;1 mm) of extremely high purity. Today, the inherently unstable gold deposits at Ampalit are in a state of both aggregation and dissolution. Identification of low energy zones, location of point bar lags in palaeo and recent drainage channels, and the extrapolation of areas of low energy are not solely valid as exploration guides for gold accumulation in this environment. Exploration methods that also recognise ground water migration and composition, and the geochemical controls of dissolution and aggregation, will improve the ability to identify ore accumulations, thus contributing to improved economics of mining these deposits. © 1994.

AB  - General pharmacological effects of GAB-88, a 3% amino acid solution with 7.5% dextrose and electrolytes, were studied in comparison with the control solution (CNT) which was prepared as having the same amino acid and dextrose concentration as GAB-88. Regarding general behavior in mice, GAB-88 had no effect at 3-30 ml/kg, iv. In central nervous system, GAB-88 at 30 ml/kg, iv prolonged hexobarbital-induced hypnosis in mice, lowered body temperature in rats, increased slow-wave in cat cortical EEG and induced vomiting in dogs. GAB-88 at 30 ml/kg, iv did not have muscle relaxation activity, anticonvulsant activity and analgesic activity in mice. In respiratory and cardio-circulatory systems of anesthetized dogs, GAB-88 hastened respiration (10-30 ml/kg, iv), lowered blood pressure (10 ml/kg, iv), increased heart rate (10-30 ml/kg, iv) and blood flow (3-10 ml/kg, iv). In digestive system, GAB-88 suppressed intestinal charcoal propulsion in mice at 30 ml/kg, iv, and bile secretion in rats at 3-30 ml/kg, iv. GAB-88 at 10 and 30 ml/kg, iv had no effect on gastric secretion in rats. In rat uterine movement in situ, GAB-88 at up to 30 ml/kg, iv had no effect on nonpregnant uterus. But, GAB-88 at 10-30 ml/kg, iv hastened transiently contractility in pregnant uterus. In renal function, GAB-88 suppressed excretion of PSP at 10-30 ml/kg, iv in dogs and increased urine output and urinary excretion of electrolytes at 10-30 ml/kg, iv and elevated urine pH at 30 ml/kg, iv in rats. In summary, GAB-88 influenced central nervous system, respiratory and cardio-circulatory systems, digestive system, uterine movement and renal function. CNT, a control solution, had similar effects on the most of such systems. It was, therefore, concluded that there were not any specific pharmacological effects in GAB-88 solution.

AB  - The general pharmacological profile of grepafloxacin (GPFX), a novel antibacterial agent, was evaluated. In the central nervous systems, GPFX showed analgesic effect in mice at 1000 mg/kg p.o., tendency to augment the pentetrazol-induced convulsion in mice at 100 mg/kg i.v. suppression of spontaneous locomotor activity, body temperature and motor coordination in mice at 60 mg/kg i.v., and decrease in the threshold voltage of EEG arousal response in rabbits at 30 mg/kg i.v. However, no effects were observed in general activity and behavior, electroshock- and strychnine-induced convulsion, hexobarbital-induced hypnosis in mice and spontaneous EEG and sleep-wakefulness cycle in rabbits. On the other hand, GPFX showed increase in wakefulness in rats at 3 mg/kg i.v. and higher. In the somatic nervous systems, GPFX did not exhibit muscle relaxation in mice, local anesthetic activity in guinea pigs or any effects on the neuromuscular transmission in cats. In autonomic nervous systems and smooth muscle, GPFX suppressed the contraction of the nictitating membrane in cats at 10 mg/kg i.v. and higher. GPFX revealed slight anti-acetylcholine effect at 3 x 10-4 M in isolated guinea-pig ileum. However, the compound did not show anti-histamic and anti-barium action in isolated guinea-pig ileum, anti-norepinephrine action in isolated non-pregnant rat vas deferens, anti-oxytocin action in isolated rat uterus and any effect in isolated guinea-pig trachea. GPFX slightly suppressed the spontaneous movement of nonpregnant rat uterus in situ at 100 mg/kg i.v. and isolated pregnant rat uterus at 3 x 10-5 M and higher. In the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, GPFX revealed transient decrease in blood pressure at 3 mg/kg i.v. and higher and elevated in heart rate at 10 mg/kg i.v. and higher in anesthetized dogs. The compound decreased the heart rate and increased contractile force of the isolated guinea-pig atrium at 10-4 M and higher. In the digestive systems, GPFX suppressed the intestinal propulsion in mice at 60 mg/kg i.v., gastric motility and gastric secretion in rats at 100 mg/kg i.v. In the others, GPFX did not reveal any effect on urine volume and urinary electrolytes excretion and anti-inflammatory effect in rats. But the compound showed hyperemia in the conjunctiva of guinea-pigs when instilled with a 1% solution.

AB  - Synopsis The combined transdermal estradiol/norethisterone therapeutic system is designed to deliver both estradiol and norethisterone into the systemic circulation at a constant rate for up to 4 days when affixed to the skin. Transdermal administration avoids hepatic first- pass metabolism, allowing therapeutic concentrations of the progestogen and estrogen to be maintained in postmenopausal women following low dose administration. Transdermal norethisterone does not appear to alter the potentially beneficial effects of transdermal estradiol on total cholesterol low- density lipoprotein (LDL) or triglyceride levels, or metabolic parameters of bone resorption or vaginal cytology. Protection of the endometriumfrom the effects of unopposed estradiol is achieved by sequential treatment with transdermal estradiol/norethisterone for 2 weeks of each 28- day cycle, and the majority of patients experience a regular vaginal bleeding pattern with this treatment regimen. Menopausal symptoms are improved to a similar extent during the transdermal estradiol- only and combined estradiol/norethisterone treatment phases. The transdermal therapeutic system has been well accepted by patients in clinical trials. It is generally well tolerated, the most common adverse effect being local irritation at the site of application. Estrogen- and progestogen- related systemic adverse events are reported in a small proportion of patients. Thus, the combined estradiol/norethisterone transdermal delivery system offers a more convenient and consistent method of progestogen administration. Together with its therapeutic efficacy when administered at lower dosages than oral therapy, it is likely to further improve patient compliance during hormone replacement therapy. Pharmacological Properties The combined estradiol/norethisterone therapeutic system is designed to deliver 0.05 mg/day estradiol and 0.25 mg/day norethisterone (given as the acetate) at a constant rate for up to 4 days. Following application of the delivery system to intact skin, steady-state plasma concentrations of norethisterone (the active gestogen), were between 1.6 and 3.2 nmol/L 2 days after the first application. Steady-state concentrations of estradiol of 0.15 to 0.18 nmol/L were reached within 24 hours, and were similar to estradiol levels in the early follicular stage of the ovulatory cycle in premenopausal women. Estradiol is rapidly cleared from the circulation following transdermal administration, with a plasma elimination half-life (t½) of about 1 hour. The t½ of norethisterone varies between 6 and 8 hours. Metabolism of both estradiol and norethisterone occurs mainly in the liver, the major metabolites being estrone, estriol and their conjugates, and the 5β,3α-norethisterone derivative, respectively. Metabolites are mainly excreted as sulphate and glucuronide conjugates in the urine, although some enterohepatic recirculation may occur. Plasma concentrations of estradiol and norethisterone return to pretreatment values within 24 and 48 hours of patch removal, respectively. Transdermal estradiol therapy appears to have a positive effect on cardiovascular disease risk factors in postmenopausal women, which may be mediated in part by the beneficial changes in lipid and lipoprotein profiles observed in patients receiving transdermal estradiol for ≥ 3 months. Addition of sequential transdermal norethisterone does not appear to significantly affect the reduced plasma levels of total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol induced by estradiol, and triglyceride levels are reduced by a similar extent during both the estrogen-only and combined estrogen/norethisterone treatment phases. Transdermal estradiol appears to have a favourable effect on carbohydrate metabolism and no net adverse effect is observed following coadministration of transdermal norethisterone. The effects of combined transdermal estradiol/norethisterone on haemostatic factors and arterial status have yet to be determined. During transdermal estradiol/norethisterone therapy, vaginal cytology is converted to a pattern similar to that found in premenopausal women, with increased numbers of superficial and decreased numbers of basal and parabasal cells. Transdermal estradiol inhibits bone resorption, as evidenced by a reduction in the urinary ratios of calcium and hydroxyproline to creatinine, and stabilisation of, or small increases in, bone mineral density in postmenopausal women receiving long term treatment. Concomitant progestogen therapy does not appear to impair, and may enhance, the bone conserving effects of estrogens; however, further investigation is necessary to confirm the latter findings. Clinical Use The clinical efficacy of the combined transdermal estradiol/norethisterone delivery system in preventing endometrial hyperplasia and controlling climacteric symptoms has been investigated in noncomparative clinical trials of up to 3 years’ duration. In most studies, transdermal estradiol 0.05 mg/day was administered for the first 2 weeks of a 28-day cycle, followed by combined transdermal estradiol/norethisterone 0.05/0.25 mg/day for the last 2 weeks. The combined transdermal estradiol/norethisterone delivery system provided endometrial protection from unopposed estradiol. Biopsy samples from more than 400 treated women showed proliferative endometrium in 1.5 to 7% and secretory endometrium in 57 to 100%. The incidence of hyperplasia in women receiving this treatment regimen was less than 2%. Sequential transdermal norethisterone induced a regular vaginal bleeding pattern in about 80% of women. Regular bleeding episodes occurred in 80 to 90% of cycles, with irregular episodes in about 5 to 11%. Amenorrhoea occurred in about 6 to 9% of cycles during therapy. In 2 small studies in which 30 women received continuous transdermal estradiol/norethisterone, the incidence of amenorrhoea was 53 and 100% after 6 months. Climacteric symptoms including hot flushes, sweating, sleep disturbance, vaginal discomfort, poor concentration and irritability were significantly improved compared with baseline in patients receiving transdermal estradiol with sequential transdermal norethisterone. Tolerability The most frequently reported adverse effects in women using transdermal estradiol or combined transdermal estradiol/norethisterone delivery systems are dermatological reactions. Transient mild erythema and itching at the site of application are the most common events. However, severe cutaneous irritation necessitating withdrawal of treatment is experienced by about 6% of patients using the estradiol-only or combined delivery systems. The occurrence of skin reactions can be minimised by selection of new sites when applying patches. Adverse systemic events associated with estrogen or progestogen therapy occurred in a small proportion of women and included breast tenderness, vaginal spotting or bleeding, fluid retention, headache, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances, bodyweight gain and depression. Of these events, unacceptable vaginal bleeding was the most common reason for patients discontinuing combined estradiol/norethisterone therapy (affecting 6 to 10%). Transdermal estradiol did not stimulate hepatic metabolism and therefore no increases in plasma levels of renin substrate, sex hormone-, thyroxin-, and cortisol-binding globulins or clotting factors were observed; however, a slight decrease in sex hormone-binding globulins was observed during combined transdermal estradiol/norethisterone treatment. Dosage and Administration For treatment of postmenopausal symptoms and symptoms of estrogen deficiency due to surgical menopause, and for prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women with an intact uterus, transdermal estradiol 0.05 mg/day is recommended for the first 14 days of a 28-day cycle, followed by 14 days of combined transdermal estradiol 0.05/norethisterone 0.25 mg/day. The transdermal delivery system should be applied to clean dry intact skin and should be changed twice weekly. Contraindications to the use of estradiol include carcinoma of the breast or endometrium, vaginal bleeding of unknown origin, previous estrogen-associated, or active thromboembolic disease or thrombophlebitis. Caution is advised in patients with past or present endometriosis, uterine leiomyomata, impaired hepatic or renal function, conditions likely to be influenced by fluid retention, or a history of depression or pregnancy-associated jaundice. © 1994, Adis International Limited.

AB  - Few studies regarding the effects of ozone exposure in the central nervous system (CNS), during the early stages of development have been reported. The study of sleep on newborn rats represents a model to understand the effects of this gas on the CNS. We studied the sleep organization in rats whose mothers were exposed to 1 part per million (ppm) ozone during pregnancy. We found severe sleep disturbances such as a decrease in paradoxical sleep duration and inversion of the light-dark cycle or a circadian phase-shift of vigilance states. These results suggest that ozone exposure during pregnancy may affect the generating mechanisms of paradoxical sleep, and the regulation of circadian rhythms in rats. © 1993.

AB  - The development of the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) in the albino rat and golden hamster was studied using anterograde transport of cholera toxin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (CT-HRP). The RHT has three components in the adult: (1) a dense projection to the ventrolateral subdivision of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) with some fibers extending into the dorsomedial SCN; (2) a projection to adjacent areas, the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) and retrochiasmatic area (RCA) and in the hamster, into the preoptic area (POA); (3) a projection to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA).In the rat, the projection to the SCN and adjacent areas first appears as scattered varicosities at the ventral border of the SCN at postnatal day 1 (P1) and gradually increases until the adult pattern is achieved at approximately P10. The projections to the AHA and RCA are seen first at P2-P3 and gradually increase to the adult appearance by P15. Both the projection to the SCN and adjacent areas and to the LHA, initially are more extensive than in the adult. Many of the axons extend well beyond the zone of the adult pattern but these anomalous fibers are eliminated by P6-P10. The LHA projection first appears at embryonic day 21-22 (E 21-22) and gradually increases in density from P1-P6. In the hamster the projections to the SCN, AHA and LHA appear first on P4 and gradually increase in density to reach the adult pattern by P15. The projections to the RCA and POA are present by P6 and reach the adult pattern by P15. None of the RHT projections in the hamster has the initial extended growth followed by pruning back that characterizes RHT development in the rat. Thus, the development of the RHT in both the rat and the hamster is complex with components of the projection appearing at different times with differing patterns of development that indicate specialized interactions of the developing axons with their target neurons. Synaptogenesis in the hamster hypothalamus was analyzed using an antiserum to synapsin I. Few synapses are present at E16, the last day of gestation, in the LHA, SCN and AHA. From P1-P3, synaptogenesis proceeds rapidly and the adult pattern is achieved in all three areas by P4. © 1993.

AB  - Conventional time-unspecified single measurements of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) may be misleading since they may be influenced, among other factors, by the patient's emotional state, position, diet and external stimuli. The evaluation of predictable variability in BP and HR by l) the use of fully ambulatory devices, and 2) the proper processing of the time series thus obtained, can be useful in assessing early cardiovascular disease risk in pregnancy. We have used this approach to quantify changes in 24-hour synchronized (circadian) characteristics of BP and HR in two consecutive pregnancies of a clinically healthy woman.The results were then compared with those obtained from data sampled after the second pregnancy. BP and HR were automatically monitored, at l-hour intervals, each time for at least 48-hours and for a total of 76 days of monitoring in each pregnancy. Circadian parameters of BP and HR were computed for each 48-hour profile by the least-squares fit of a 24-hour cosine curve. Regression analysis of parameters thus obtained revealed patterns of variation of circadian rhythm-adjusted means and amplitudes with gestational age. This pattern of variation is not found for data sampled during non-pregnancy on the same woman. This longitudinal study confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable pregnancy-associated variability in BP and HR and also allows the establishment of prediction and confidence limits for cardiovascular parameters in a healthy pregnancy.

AB  - Male rats were neonatally treated with 1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione (ATD), which blocks aromatization of testosterone (T) to estradiol (E2), from Days 0, 2, or 5 through 14. Adult partner preference behavior (PPB; choice between estrous female rat [F] and active male rat [M]) was studied in the early part of the dark phase of the light-dark (LD) cycle. ATD Day 0 Ms showed a preference for the stimulus M or showed no preference for either of the stimulus Ss. Controls preferred the estrous F. ATD Days 2 and 5 Ms showed PPB intermediate between ATD Day 0 Ms and controls. Thus the neonatally sensitive period for organization of adult PPB extends beyond Day 5. Furthermore, PPB showed a nocturnal rhythmicity in ATD Ms but not in controls. In the late part of the dark phase, all Ms showed a preference for the stimulus F. ATD Days 2 and 5 Ms and control Ms were no longer different in PPB, but ATD Day 0 Ms still showed significantly lower preference scores for F than all other Ms. Thus the E2 metabolite of T suppresses organization of an adult nocturnal rhythm in PPB.

AB  - In order to study the relationship between plasma prolactin (PRL) levels and the secretion pattern of this hormone, blood samples were performed every 10 minutes for six hours on dry, restricted and unrestricted suckling Texel ewes on Days 7 and 30 after October or November lambings. On Day 7 post partum, mean plasma PRL concentration, frequency and amplitude of PRL pulses were higher in unrestricted suckling ewes than those in other groups (P < 0.01). Moreover, mean plasma PRL concentrations irrespective of the managing mode were positively related to PRL pulse frequency on Day 7 (R = 0.74, P = 0.0001) and Day 30 (R = 0.43, P = 0.087) post partum. In a second experiment, hourly blood sampling was performed for a period of 24 consecutive hours on cyclic ewes at the luteal or estrual phase (in December), and on seasonal anestrius (in March) or pregnant (in May) ewes in order to study daily variations in PRL secretion. Day/night variations in prolactinemia were only detected in cyclic ewes in December (P < 0.05) not in seasonal anestrous or pregnant ewes in March or May. During the estrual phase of the cycle, the results clearly showed a circahemidian rhythm in PRL secretion with a significant increase at the beginning of daylight or darkness (P < 0.01).

AB  - All-trans-retinoic acid is a potent developmental toxicant in all species examined. The teratogenic risk of topical all-trans-retinoic acid is reviewed. Experimental studies are limited because of the high maternal toxicity, including skin irritation, with doses below those resulting in significant teratogenic response with other application routes, such as oral application. The maximal systemic availability reported for transdermal exposure of all-trans-retinoic acid was 5-6% in the rat, 9.6% in the monkey (48% with dermatitic skin) and 5-7% in the human. Oral administration of threshold teratogenic doses of all-trans-retinoic acid (6 mg/kg/day) to Wistar rats and Swiss hare rabbits resulted in embryonic area under the concentration time curve levels (approximately 1,000 ng·h/g) which were 2- to 4-fold higher than the endogenous all-trans-retinoic acid levels; corresponding maternal plasma area under the concentration time curve values were 98 and 321 ng·h/ml in rat and rabbit, respectively. The 4-oxo-metabolite was also found in maternal plasma and embryo. Large, controlled studies on the possible developmental toxicity of topical all-trans-retinoic acid in the human are not available. Isolated case reports appeared in the literature claiming teratogenic outcome resembling effects after oral isotretinoin use or those observed in experimental studies with oral or parenteral all-trans-retinoic acid administration. The dose absorbed from daily cosmetic or therapeutic application of all-trans-retinoic acid is expected to be below 0.015 mg/kg, which is at least 30-fold lower than the lowest teratogenic dose of isotretinoin in the human. Topical all-trans-retinoic acid application did not appreciably alter endogenous plasma retinoid levels. The influence of nutrition, diurnal variation and in particular oral vitamin A supplements are more important determinants of plasma retinoic acid compounds than topical all-trans-retinoic acid. These results imply a low risk of therapeutic or cosmetic application of topical all-trans-retinoic acid. However, the highly specific spatial and temporal distribution of binding proteins and nuclear receptors in the embryo suggests that even small alterations in endogenous levels of all-trans-retinoic acid in the embryo may alter crucial developmental processes such as morphogenes; this aspect should be further investigated.

AB  - Many pregnant women are exposed to low frequency sounds and vibrations while at work or play. How the fetus is affected by these physical stimuli is not clearly documented. We recorded behavioral state and intrauterine sound pressure levels in eight fetal sheep previously instrumented with electrocortical, electroocular and neck electromyographic leads, and with a miniature hydrophone. Data were collected before, during and after 30 min of abdominal vibration using a belt vibrator commonly used by humans in weight reduction programs. A sudden shift in behavioral state occurred at the onset of vibration. There was a decrease in non-rapid eye movement sleep (P < 0.02) and an increase in time during which the sleep state could not be determined (P < 0.03). A 63% increase in number of epochs spent in this indeterminate period was evident during vibration. During the post-stimulus period, percentage of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep decreased as compared to the pre-stimulus period (P < 0.04), and non-rapid eye movement sleep increased as compared to the stimulus period (P < 0.01). Vibration-induced intrauterine sound pressures ranged from 131-142 dB at the fundamental frequency of 19 Hz and were 20-40 dB lower at the overtones which appeared in the spectrum between 35-200 Hz. Results indicated that environmental vibration can disrupt fetal behavioral state, induce abnormal state changes, and alter distribution of sleep states.

AB  - Behavioral state and cerebral glucose utilization were measured in six fetal sheep subjected to high intrauterine sound pressures created with a vibroacoustic stimulator pressed against the maternal abdomen. The signal consisted of a complex waveform that varied over time with a 50% duty cycle. An implanted hydrophone showed highest spectral levels between 3,000-16,000 Hz. The pulsed sound resulted in a significant loss of fetal rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep. The stimulus also resulted in a disruption in the normally close relationship between these sleep states and cerebral glucose utilization rates in the brain as a whole and in its component parts.

AB  - The peripheral chemoresponses of infant twin pairs were determined using a single-breath hyperoxic stimulus. A total of 43 twin pairs of comparable gestation and birth weight were studied during sleep at a mean (SD) age of 8 wk (1.4) while alternately breathing either air or 16% oxygen in nitrogen. Infants responded to a single breath of 100% oxygen by a reduction in ventilation; the mean (SEM) reduction in air was 273 ml/min (10.6) and in 16% oxygen 560 ml/min (18.4). Within-pair variances were compared in 14 monozygotic and 28 dizygotic pairs utilizing combined responses (air + 16% oxygen) computed for measurements made in behavioral quiet sleep and in 9 monozygotic and 20 dizygotic pairs for whom data were complete in polygraphically confirmed quiet sleep. The variance of responses within dizygotic twin pairs was greater than in monozygotic pairs when expressed in ml/min: F ratio 4.11 (p = 0.005) for all data and F ratio 7.67 (p = 0.003) in quiet sleep. Expressed in ml/min/kg the difference was less significant: F ratio 1.83 (p = 0.126) for all data and F ratio 3.46 (p = 0.039) in quiet sleep. Gender, birth weight, and birth order had no effect on these findings. This closer similarity of response in monozygotic twin pairs is explained by proposing a high degree of heritability for the response.

AB  - This study examines the extent to which altering maternal metabolism via chronic cold exposure (i.e., winter shearing) and changes in feed intake over the final month of gestation influences development changes in breathing control during non-rapid eye-movement sleep (Non-REM) of neonatal lambs. In lambs born from well-fed (100% of total energy requirement) unshorn ewes metabolic rate and breathing frequency was lower between 4-30 days of age than those born from under-fed ewes (60% of total requirements for unshorn ewes). Laryngeal braking of expiratory airflow was observed in ca 40% of breaths during non-REM sleep at 14 and 30 days of age in lambs born from well-fed ewes compared with ca 10% of breaths in the under-fed group. The combined effects of under-feeding plus chronic cold exposure (of shorn ewes) resulted in newborn lambs which possess brown adipose tissue with an increased thermogenic activity, and exhibited a higher metabolic rate and breathing frequency over the first day of neonatal life. Laryngeal braking of expiratory airflow was commonly observed in lambs born from shorn ewes between 4-30 days of age, despite maternal under-feeding ewes. It is concluded that changes in maternal metabolism can influence developmental changes in breathing control which may be linked to effects on the control of thermoregulation.

AB  - Aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of flumazenil when used for recovery after midazolam-induced sedation in short acting, out-patient procedure like interruption of early pregnancy. A significantly faster recovery of the patients after injection of flumazenil was observed. When flumazenil was not used, patients remained drowsy, worse oriented, and less co-operative at 1.5 and 20 min after completion of abortion. There were no significant difference between the groups with and without flumazenil at the 60 min. In conclusion when it is possible to observe the patients for more than one hour, the application of flumazenil after sedation with midazolam is not necessary.
In a comparative study, the efficacy of flumazenil, when used for recovery after midazolam-induced sedation for outpatient procedures, was assessed in two groups of women undergoing early termination of pregnancy at a university maternity ward. The 1st group of 32 women received flumazenil immediately after the procedure, while the 2nd group did not. The 2nd group consisted of 30 women who underwent early abortion (10-11 weeks). Their average age was 29.9 years (range, 18-42 years); their weight averaged 60.6 kg (range, 43-72 kg). Premedication consisted of 0.5 mg of venous atropine. The average dose of anesthesia with midazolam amounted to 15.08 mg per patient. The patients fell asleep within 1-3 minutes after receiving the drug (average, 1.87 minutes). The average time of awakening was 6.6 minutes (range, 2-20 minutes). The average duration of the procedure was 5.45 minutes (range, 3-14 minutes). Awakening and getting up were evaluated according to the modified scheme of Stewart after 1, 5, 20, and 60 minutes. Phase 1 meant that the patient did not open her eyes and did not react to a command; Phase 2 occurred when the patient opened her eyes and responded to the command; Phase 3 occurred when the patient was in light sleep and moments later opened her eyes; and Phase 4 occurred when the patient fully awakened, opened her eyes, and began to talk. Correlation analysis showed a significant reverse relationship between the speed of recovery after administration of midazolam and the administration of flumazenil at 5 minutes (r = - 0.8) and at 20 minutes (r = - 0.9), but at 60 minutes the differences were evened out (r = - 0.32). When flumazenil was not used the patients remained drowsy at 1, 5, and 20 minutes after completion of abortion. When the patients can be observed for more than 1 hour, the administration of flumazenil after sedation with midazolam is not necessary.

AB  - The definition of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy is plagued by many difficulties, in part related to the limits of intermittent clinic readings of blood pressure. In order to better define the evolution of arterial blood pressure in normal subjects during normal pregnancy, casual and ambulatory (Spacelabs 90207, n = 22 or Diasys 200, n = 26) measurements of blood pressure were performed at gestational months 3, 6, and 9, in 48 normal women aged 18 to 39, both nulliparas (n = 19) and multiparas (n = 29). Ambulatory blood pressure levels were lowest in the first gestational trimester (24-hour mean: 104 ± 8 63 ± 6 mm Hg) and rose by a small increment during the last trimester (109 ± 8 67 ± 7 mm Hg at 8 months). Mean daytime ambulatory pressure was almost superimposable to clinic measurements at the three time points. A day-night variation in blood pressure level was detectable in all subjects at each recording. It is concluded that during normal pregnancy, ambulatory blood pressure levels were highest in the day and lowest at night at all gestational ages and increased only minimally before the ninth month. Reference values, as defined by the percentile distribution of daytime and nighttime systolic and diastolic blood pressure, may help define more precisely an alteration in the level and/or the circadian variation of arterial blood pressure during abnormal pregnancies. © 1993.

AB  - A chiral high-performance liquid chromatographic assay for the separation of the four stereoisomers of labetalol, an antihypertensive, in biological fluids has been developed. Baseline separation of the isomers was achieved using an α1-acid glycoprotein stationary phase. No interference from endogenous substances was observed following extraction from various biological fluids obtained from pregnant (ewe and fetus) and non-pregnant sheep. The concentration of the individual isomers of labetalol was determined by first measuring the total concentration of racemic labetalol obtained from an achiral assay followed by reassay of each sample by the chiral method after which, by using the estimate of the percentage of each individual isomer, the individual concentration of each of the four isomers was determined. The mobile phase was 0.02 M phosphate buffer containing 0.015 M tetrabutylammonium phosphate. The pH of the mobile phase was adjusted to 7.10. The detector was set at an excitation wavelength of 230 nm and emission wavelength of 400 nm to monitor the nascent fluorescence intensity of the isomers of labetalol. The limit of detection of the individual isomers was 0.15 ng (0.6 ng of injected racemic labetalol). The assay was linear over the range 0.6-15.0 ng of labetalol (injected) with the intra- and inter-day mean coefficients of variation being less than 9.0 and 6.0%, respectively. Application of the assay in the study of pharmacokinetics of the stereoisomers of labetalol in sheep following administration of racemic labetalol has been demonstrated. © 1993.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of intrathecal meperidine in patients undergoing Caesarean section, and also to compare meperidine with heavy lidocaine. Fifty fall-term pregnant women, ASA physical status I or II, presenting for elective Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were randomly divided into two groups with 25 in each, to receive either intrathecal meperidine or lidocaine. All patients received premedication with oral ranitidine, 150 mg, the night before surgery, and again two hours before surgery. Patients in the meperidine group were also given metoclopramide iv 10 mg one hour before surgery. After iv 20 ml·kg-1 Ringer's lactate, patients were given either 5% meperidine 1 mg · kg-1 or 5% heavy lidocaine 1.2 to 1.4 ml intrathecally. The sensory and motor blockades in all except two patients in each group who required sedation at the time of skin incision were adequate for surgery. None of the mothers suffered from any major side effects. The incidence of hypotension was higher in the lidocaine group than in meperidine group (P &lt; 0.05). Pruritus and drowsiness were more common in meperidine group than in lidocaine group (P &lt; 0.01). All the newborns in both groups cried immediately after birth and had an Apgar scope &gt; 7. The mean duration of postoperative analgesia was six hours in the meperidine group and one hour in the lidocaine group (P &lt; 0.01). Postoperative analgesia requirement was less in the meperidine than in the lidocaine group (P &lt; 0.01). It is concluded that intrathecal 5% meperidine in a dose of 1 mg·kg-1 is superior to 5% heavy lidocaine because of the prolonged postoperative analgesia. The commercial 5% solution of meperidine can be used, without addition, for this purpose. © 1993 Canadian Anesthesiologists.

AB  - The measurement of fetal blood flow velocity and 24 h monitoring of fetal heart-rate (FHR) using a computer were performed to clarify the haemodynamics of growth-retarded fetuses with chronic hypoxia. One hundred normal-growth and 18 growth-retarded fetuses were analysed. All the growth-retarded fetuses with chronic hypoxia were characterised by abnormal blood flow velocity waveforms (with the pulsatility index in the descending aorta below the -1·0 SD and in the middle cerebral artery above the +1·0 SD for our reference range, from 100 normal-growth fetuses). In the latter, the incidence of accelerations of defined size and variability in FHR patterns showed a diurnal variation after 30 weeks' gestation. The initial change in FHR patterns during hypoxia in 11 growth-retarded fetuses, resulting in fetal distress, was a derangement of diurnal variations in FHR patterns, followed by a decrease in variability. A rapid increase in blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery with the advance of hypoxia was observed before the onset of distress. Maternal low-dose oxygen inhalation elicited a temporary increase in FHR variability in the growth-retarded but not in normal fetuses. Re-inhalation after 1 h elicited a similar change, suggesting that intermittent rather than continuous, oxygen inhalation may be more effective. © 1993 IFMBE.

AB  - In Syrian hamsters, the circadian timing system is sensitive to melatonin during gestation but is not responsive in the adult. In order to further understand this developmental change in melatonin responsiveness, in vitro autoradiography was used to assess the presence of specific 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding sites in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of female hamsters of selected embryonic (E) and postnatal (PN) ages (e.g. E13, E14, E15, PN1, PN2, PN12, PN25, PN112-133). Specific 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding sites were seen in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of some of the E14 hamsters and all the perinatal hamsters (E15, PN1 and PN2) but not in older hamsters. In contrast, specific 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding sites were seen in the pars tuberalis of all hamsters (with the exception of one), regardless of age. The transient expression of specific 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding sites in the suprachiasmatic nuclei suggests that melatonin may have some special functions restricted to early development. The specific 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding sites in the embryonic suprachiasmatic nuclei may represent the substrate for maternal melatonin to set the phase of the developing circadian timing system. © 1993.

AB  - This article identifies and reviews research related to sleeplessness reported by nurses in the literature. The current state of clinical nursing research as it relates to sleep is evaluated, including the content, methodology, and implications for further research. Although the review indicates current interest in sleep by clinical nurse researchers, the number of nursing studies in the literature is limited, especially within specific areas, such as age groups and setting. Also, directions for future nursing research on sleep are recommended.

AB  - We have isolated two sheep IGF-II clones which have the same coding regions but have different 5′-untranslated regions. There is no homology between these 5′-UTR sequences which are homologous to exons 5 and 6 of the human IGFII gene. In humans these exons are transcribed only during fetal development, but in the sheep these transcripts were detected up to 28 weeks after parturition. The sizes of the sheep IGF-II mRNA transcripts are the same as those observed for the human gene, suggesting structural and transcriptional similarity between the human and sheep IGF-II genes. The sheep could therefore be a good model system in which to study IGF-II expression. © 1993.

AB  - The human hypothalamus is involved in a wide range of functions in the developing, adult and aging subject and is responsible for a large number of symptoms of neuroendocrine, neurological and psychiatric diseases. In the present review some prominent hypothalamic nuclei are discussed in relation to normal development, sexual differentiation, aging and a number of neuropathological conditions. The suprachiasmatic nucleus, the clock of the brain, shows seasonal and circadian variations in its vasopressin neurons. During normal aging, but even more so in Alzheimer's disease, the number of these neurons decreases. In homosexual men this nucleus is larger than in heterosexual men. The difference between the sexually dimorphic nuclei of men and women arises between the ages of 2-4 to puberty. In adult men this nucleus is twice as large as in adult women. In the process of aging, a sex-dependent decrease in cell number occurs. The vasopressin and oxytocin cells of the supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus are present in adult numbers as early as mid-gestation. Lower oxytocin neuron numbers are found in Prader-Willi syndrome, AIDS and Parkinson's disease. Familial hypothalamic diabetes insipidus is based upon a point mutation in the vasopressin-neurophysin-glycopeptide gene. Parvicellular corticotropin-releasing hormone-containing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus increase in number and are activated during the course of aging. In post-menopausal women, the infundibular or arcuate nucleus contains hypertrophie neurons containing oestrogen receptors. These neurons may be involved in the initiation of menopausal flushes. The nucleus tuberalis lateralis may be involved in feeding behaviour and metabolism. In Huntington's disease the majority of its neurons is lost; in Alzheimer's disease it shows very strong cytoskeletal alterations. Tuberomammillary nucleus neurons contain, e.g., histamine or galanine, and project to the cortex. Strong cytoskeletal changes, as well as plaques and tangles are found in this nucleus in Alzheimer's disease. The various hypothalamic nuclei are probably involved in many functions and symptoms of which only a minority has been revealed. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The role of the fetal circadian pacemaker in the timing of birth was examined in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Two groups of pregnant hamsters with lesions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus received daily intraperitoneal injections of melatonin (25 μg) on Days 9-15 of gestation. One group was injected with melatonin in the evening and the other in the morning. After the last set of injections, the animals were observed every hour until they gave birth. The timing of birth was not significantly different in the two groups, indicating that it was not affected by the melatonin injections. In contrast, the average phases of the pups' activity rhythms at weaning were significantly different in the two groups; this difference, approximately 10 h, indicated that the prenatal melatonin injections set the phases of the pups' circadian pacemakers. These results suggest that the fetal pacemaker is not involved in the timing of birth, since the pacemaker could be set to different phases without affecting this timing. In a separate study, time of birth and length of gestation were measured for heterozygous tau mutant pups, which express a circadian rhythm with a period of approximately 22 h. The results were compared with similar measurements obtained from a previous study of wild-type pups that express a circadian rhythm with a period of approximately 24 h. In both cases, the pups had been born to wild-type mothers. The timing of birth was similar in the two groups, indicating that the tau mutation does not influence the length of gestation or the time of day when birth occurs.

AB  - The study objective was to investigate whether exclusively breast-fed infants could be taught to sleep through the night (defined from 12:00 AM to 5:00 AM) during the first 8 weeks of life. The design was short-term longitudinal, from the last trimester of pregnancy until the eighth week after birth. Twenty- six first-time parents and their newborn were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups (13 in each group). Treatment parents were instructed to offer a 'focal feed' (between 10 PM and 12 AM) to their infants every night, to gradually lengthen intervals between middle-of-the-night feeds by carrying out alternative caretaking behaviors (eg, reswaddling, diapering, walking), and to maximize environmental differences between day and nighttime. All parents kept 72-hour diaries of their infants' feeding and sleeping patterns every week from birth to 8 weeks of age and rated their infants' temperament at birth and at 8 weeks. By 3 weeks, treatment infants showed significantly longer sleep episodes at night. By 8 weeks 100% of treatment infants were sleeping through the night compared to 23% of control infants. Treatment infants were feeding less frequently at night but compensated for the relatively long nighttime interval without a feed by consuming more milk in the early morning. Milk intake for 24-hour periods did not differ between groups. Treatment infants were rated as more predictable on Bates' Infant Characteristics Questionnaire. It is concluded that parents can have a powerful influence on the development of their infants' sleep patterns. Frequent night waking in breast-fed infants often results in early termination of lactation. Parents can teach their breast- fed infants to lengthen their nighttime sleep bouts, making the continuation of breast-feeding easier for the new mother.

AB  - The nursing rhythms of 14 rabbit does and the activity of 18 litters from birth to days 14-16 were monitored continuously, as were the circadian rhythms of different behavioral functions of 10 young rabbits from weaning until day 380 of life. The does gave birth 2 hr, 26 min ± 2 hr, 8 min after lights-on in a light-dark cycle (LD 12:12). The first nursing occurred 20 hr, 30 min ± 2 hr, 21 min after parturition. Does that had continuous access to the nest boxes exhibited a regular once-a-day nursing rhythm; the nursing visits to the litters occurred during the dark phase (D). The nursing visits lasted 3 min, 42 sec ± 25 sec. Nursing advanced during the first 10 days of lactation by an average of 42 ± 16 min/day, and thus shifted to the first half of D. The pups anticipated nursing by a significant increase of activity, which was established between days 1 and 5 of life. In two does, the nursing rhythm split into two nursing visits per day, one during D and one during the light phase (L). When scheduled to nurse at an “artificial” phase in L with T = 24 hr, the pups’ anticipatory activity was entrained by the 24-hr nursing rhythm. During a 48-hr fast, the elevated activity persisted around the phase of prior nursing time, demonstrating that it was controlled by an endogenous oscillator entrained by the zeitgeber of maternal nursing. Of 10 weanlings, 6 first exhibited a trimodal rhythm, which turned bimodal within 3-6 days. Stable entrainment by the external LD zeitgeber was attained by about days 45-80, and full nocturnality was attained by about days 200-250 after weaning. Having attained steady-state conditions, 7 of 10 rabbits exhibited a stable unimodal, nocturnal rhythm in each of the five functions, while the other 3 retained a bimodal rhythm. © 1993, Sage Publications.

AB  - Twenty-five-day-old rats maintained in constant darkness since birth and born from mothers kept in the dark since the 14th day of pregnancy showed a circadian rhythm of α-amylase content in parotid glands, which may be explained by a mechanism of maternal co-ordination. Rats in the same conditions, except that their mothers had been submitted to bilateral excision of the superior cervical ganglia 30 days before mating, did not show diurnal variations of α-amylase activity in the parotid glands. When ganglionectomized mothers were treated with a daily dose of melatonin (1 mg/kg) from the 14th day of gestation up to the 10th day of lactation, their litters showed significant diurnal variations of amylase in the parotid glands, suggesting a role of the maternal pineal gland in the maternal-fetal and/or maternal-neonatal transfer of photoperiodic information. © 1993.

In the prepartum, a highly significant circadian rhythm was seen in Cortisol, with a lower-amplitude rhythm in progesterone (AM/PM = 1.12). Evening samples showed a rise in Cortisol, with a highly significant rise on day -1. The rise was small. The fall in progesterone in the 3 days before parturition was also small (approximately 6%). Neither change provides an obvious trigger for parturition. © 1993 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Circadian rhythms are present during fetal life in several mammalian species. To characterize the ontogeny of the neural mechanisms that account for circadian rhythmicity in a precocious species, we studied the prenatal development of the retinohypothalamic pathway in lambs (gestation period of 147 days), using horseradish peroxidase and wheat germ agglutinin as anterograde tracers. The suprachiasmatic nucleus was present as early as embryonic day 52 (E52). After E58, the suprachiasmatic nucleus reached its full number of neurons, estimated by the disector method in about 160,000 cells per nucleus at E62. The retinohypothalamic axons invaded the suprachiasmatic nucleus from E58, while neuroblasts were still migrating to the nucleus. At E62, there was a strong retinal projection that evolved until E121, when the retinal afferents established their definitive pattern of distribution in the ventral and central regions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and adjacent hypothalamic structures. The development of the retinohypothalamic pathway was delayed by about a week relative to the innervation of other subcortical visual centers. The present findings demonstrated an early prenatal development of the visual pathways in lambs, including the retinohypothalamic pathway, suggesting that the mechanisms for the visual entrainment of circadian rhythms in lambs may be functioning several weeks before birth. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

AB  - Continuous measurement of normal contractions in 57 primiparae and multiparae showed a minimum in the mornings and a marked peaking of frequency between 8:30 PM and 2:00 AM. This could be due to a periodic fluctuation in the parameters influencing uterine motility. At night, motility-enhancing factors such as estrogens and prostaglandins predominate. These results suggest that in cases at high risk for premature delivery, with high pelvic scores, therapy should be continued at night. In addition, the time when the contractions were recorded should be taken into account when assessing their frequency, and the measurement repeated if necessary.

AB  - This paper summarizes the recent knowledge on the role of melatonin in humans. The first part of the present review considers the following aspects: circadian rhythm of melatonin excretion, melatonin in body fluids, melatonin influence on sexual maturation, changes of melatonin blood concentration during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy, and the influence of melatonin administration on prolactin concentration. Current views on the relationship between melatonin and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal cortex axis, as well as on changes of melatonin concentration during hypothyreosis, hyperthyreosis, and hyperparathyroidism are also discussed.

AB  - Adaptations to our environment are of two types: Reactive, in which the adaptation follows an environmental change, and predictive, in which the organism anticipates the environmental change before it takes place. We live in an organized environment in which day and night, seasons, and tides alternate. These events repeat themselves with a given frequency, and organisms living on earth successfully adapt to them in a predictive fashion. The overt expression of these adaptations are cyclic changes in physiological processes known as circadian, tidal, and seasonal rhythms. Circadian rhythms are predictive adaptations to the daily periods of light and dark (day and night) induced by rotation of the earth around its axis (1). They are loosely defined as changes in a physiological function with a period of approximately 24 h. Their presence is established by obtaining frequent measurements of a variable over a period of 24 or 48 h; the data are then analyzed by standard statistical methods such as analysis of variance for repeated measures, lineal contrast analysis, or by fitting a mathematical function to the data such as cosinor analysis or Fourier analysis (2). © 1993 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Heavy water (D2O) lengthens the period of free-running circadian rhythms in most organisms. We compared the effect of D2O on freerunning locomotor activity rhythms in intact and SCN-lesioned (SCN-X) hamsters that had recovered circadian rhythmicity following implantation of SCN grafts. The animals were housed individually in cages equipped with running wheels, and locomotor activity was monitored using a computer-based data acquisition system. At the end of the behavioral tests, animals were anesthetized and perfused. Brain sections were immunostained for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and vasopressin (VP) to evaluate the extent of the lesion and the presence of a functional graft. The D2O similarly lengthened the period of free-running activity without affecting amount of activity in both intact and in SCN-X grafted animals. The results indicate that D2O acts directly on the SCN to lengthen the free-running period, and suggest that coupling between pacemakers within the grafted SCN is as efficient as in the intact SCN. © 1993.

AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) completes the diagnostic approach to hypertension of pregnancy, by providing a dynamic study of the blood pressure status of the pregnant woman. It corrects certain erroneous diagnoses of hypertension of pregnancy, in particular those related to the 'White coat' effect, especially common in pregnant women. ABPM enables the study of nocturnal blood pressured figures, known for their prognostic value in hypertension of pregnancy. Finally, while loss or reversal of circadian rhythm appears to be of good predictive value regarding the onset of eclampsia, it is above all blood pressure load which appears to be harmful to fetal growth and maturity. ABPM also facilitates management by improving the compliance of pregnant women with regular monitoring and with treatment, by more accurately guiding the surveillance of drug treatment.

AB  - To determine whether 24-h rhythms characterize hormone secretion and uterine activity in the pregnant sheep, blood samples were drawn every 1-4 h for 48 h from ewes and fetuses from day 120 of gestation to term. Repetitive 24-h rhythms were absent for cortisol, progesterone, and prolactin in maternal and fetal circulation and for hourly mean uterine contraction rate and amplitude. To test whether photoperiod or pineal melatonin contributes to the absence of rhythms, pineal-intact and pinealectomized ewes and their fetuses were studied in reverse photoperiod. Again, there was little evidence to suggest 24-h endocrine rhythms except for prolactin in two fetuses by cosinor analyses. Prolactin concentrations were increased in pinealectomized ewes and their fetuses. In the apparent absence of rhythms, 20 of 21 pineal- intact ewes gave birth at night; however, 6 out of 7 pinealectomized ewes gave birth during the day. Thus photoperiod and the maternal pineal gland profoundly influenced the time of day of birth in the absence of circadian endocrine or uterine activity rhythms.

AB  - Conventional time-unspecified single measurements of blood pressure and heart rate may be misleading because they may be influenced, among other factors, by the patient's emotional state, position, diet, and external stimuli. All of these effects depend on the stages of a (mathematical) spectrum of rhythms and trends with age. The evaluation of predictable variability in blood pressure and heart rate by (a) the use of fully ambulatory devices, and (b) chronobiologic data processing, assesses early cardiovascular disease risk, e.g., in pregnancy. We have used this approach to quantify changes in 24-h synchronized (circadian) characteristics of cardiovascular variables in two consecutive pregnancies of a clinically healthy woman. Blood pressure and heart rate were automatically monitored, with few interruptions, at I-h intervals, each time for at least 48 consecutive h, and for a total of 76 days of monitoring in each pregnancy. Circadian parameters of those circulatory variables were computed for each single day of measurement by the least-squares fit of a 24-h cosine curve. Regression analysis of parameters thus obtained revealed patterns of variation of circadian-rhythm-adjusted means and amplitudes with gestational age. In both pregnancies, the predictable variability of the circadian-rhythm-adjusted mean of blood pressure can be approximated by a second-order polynomial model on gestational age: a steady linear decrease in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure up to the 22nd week of pregnancy is followed by an increase in blood pressure up to the day of delivery. This longitudinal study confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable pregnancy-associated variability in blood pressure and heart rate and also allows the establishment of prediction and confidence limits for cardiovascular parameters in a healthy pregnancy. © 1993 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - Abstract: Although sleep disturbance is commonly reported in pregnancy, there have been surprisingly few studies on the etiology of this condition. Since most hormones show circadian rhythmicity and maintain specific phase relationships with that of the sleep‐wake cycle, it was of interest to establish whether sleep disturbances covaried with endocrine changes. This overnight study of pregnant women compared melatonin, cortisol, and prolactin secretion rhythms in six good sleepers and six poor sleepers. The groups were compared by ratios of the areas under the various hormonal curves. Significant differences in the cortisol/melatonin ratio were found between the poor sleeper group (lower values) and the good sleeper group (higher values). Nonsignificant trends, which might be expected to become significant with larger sample sizes, were found for decreased amplitude in the cortisol rhythm and increased amplitude in the melatonin rhythm in poor sleepers. The decreased amplitude of the cortisol rhythm in poor sleepers appeared to be due to a suppression of the early morning (0500–0800) rise. Prolactin levels were high and showed no rhythmicity in both groups. These differences may reflect changes in the circadian pacemaker system of poor sleepers, with increases in melatonin release being a response to counteract poor sleep.

AB  - Pregnancy-associated changes in metallothionein (MT) concentrations in blood plasma were examined using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to rat liver MT. Plasma MT of pregnant rats significantly increased after 8 days of gestation and remained high during pregnancy and for 7 days after delivery. Gel filtration showed that both Cu and Zn were associated with the plasma MT of pregnant rats. These results suggest that plasma MT may play a role in the transport of essential metals such as Cu and Zn to fetus during pregnancy, but the source of plasma MT is unknown. Injections of cadmium chloride and cadmium-metallothionein to pregnant rats further increased the plasma MT concentrations. After injection of CdCl2, both MT and Cd concentrations in the liver of the pregnant rats were significantly lower than those of the nonpregnant rats, whereas renal Cd and MT levels were higher in pregnant rats. This increased accumulation of Cd in the kidney of pregnant rats may be related to the increase of plasma MT during pregnancy. About 5% of 6 pg of in vitro added Cd (20 pg/ml) was bound to the MT in the plasma. Therefore, Cd may be transported by the circulating MT to the kidney, leading to an increase in renal accumulation of Cd in pregnant rats. © 1993, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The objective was to determine whether large antepartum decelerations in fetal heart rate were associated with a switch from high to low fetal heart rate variation, suggestive of a change in sleep state, and whether the variation predicted outcome. Study Design: Retrospective computerized analysis of 10,272 cardiotocographic records from 3998 patients at 37 to 42 weeks' gestation from four centers in England and Italy identified 140 good-quality records with large decelerations (more than 20 lost beats in area). Results: In otherwise normal cardiotocograms a large deceleration had a 40% chance of association with a downward change in fetal heart rate variation (69% when the deceleration exceeded 100 lost beats). The change resembled that occurring naturally with behavioral states. Uterine contractions did not always precede large decelerations. When they did, the lag time (peak of contraction — trough of deceleration) increased from 28 seconds (at 20 to 29 lost beats) to > 100 seconds with increase in deceleration area. Of patients with large decelerations 76% had a normal vaginal delivery. Conclusion: Large decelerations near term, present in up to 5% of patients with otherwise normal fetal heart rate and variation, are often associated with a fall in fetal heart rate variation characteristic of a change in sleep state, without ominous significance. © 1993, Mosby.

AB  - Mating stimuli received by female rats activate a neuroendocrine mnemonic system which produces daily diurnal and nocturnal prolactin (PRL) surges for the first half of gestation, surges which help maintain corpora lutea function and a viable pregnancy. Since these PRL surges may be regulated in part by endogenous opioids and opioid sensitivity declines as a function of multiple births, we decided to investigate the possibility that prior parity might affect the post-coital diurnal and nocturnal PRL surges, reducing their magnitude and/or occurrence. Age-matched, nulliparous and primiparous rats were mated to males from our colony. On days 5 or 10 of pregnancy females received jugular catheters. Blood samples were collected at regular intervals from 1000 h on day 7 to 1000 h on day 8, and from 1000 h on day 12 to 1000 h on day 13 of gestation in separate sets of multigravid and primigravid rats. Measurement of plasma PRL by radioimmunoassay revealed that prior reproductive experience altered the patterns and levels of plasma PRL. Plasma PRL levels were significantly reduced during both the diurnal and nocturnal surges on days 7-8 in multigravid rats when compared with levels in primigravid rats. No differences in PRL levels were found between primigravid and multigravid groups on days 12 to 13 of gestation. The changes in diurnal and nocturnal PRL surges during early pregnancy indicate that prior parity reduces the subsequent secretion of PRL, possibly by altering the neuroendocrine regulation of this hormone. © 1993.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that fetectomy will eliminate or substantially after rhythms in maternal estradiol concentrations and subsequently reduce or eliminate uterine activity rhythms. STUDY DESIGN: Six rhesus macaques underwent surgery for catheter implantation between days 117 and 122 of gestation (term = 167 days). At surgery the fetuses were removed and the membranes and placenta remained intact. Thirteen additional catheterized pregnant animals served as controls. Maternal arterial blood samples were collected for hormone analysis at 3-hour intervals for 24 hours, starting at 9 am. This sampling protocol was performed four times at weekly intervals until 151 to 157 days' gestation. RESULTS: A significant rhythm (p < 0.01) in estradiol was determined in the control animals with peak concentrations observed in the morning hours whereas the progesterone peak was observed at night. In the fetectomy group mean plasma estradiol concentrations decreased significantly from 312 ± 34 to 110 ± 8 pg/ml throughout the study (p < 0.01). Despite a trend toward elevated morning levels, the estradiol rhythm was ablated. The uterine contractile rhythm observed in the control animals with peak activity between 10 PM and midnight (p < 0.01) was also ablated after fetecomy. Basal concentrations of progesterone were significantly lower than control values. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Fetectomy resulted in the elimination of the maternal estradiol rhythm. (2) The uterine activity rhythm was lost after fetecomy. These data suggest that the fetus, by supplying precursors of estrogen, may play an indirect role in the regulation of maternal estradiol rhythms, which in turn appear to play a key role in regulating uterine activity rhythms. © 1993.

AB  - Objective: The advisability of sexual activity during pregnancy has been controversial for a long time. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between sexual activity and uterine contractility in the home environment. Design, Setting, Participants: We carried out a prospective cohort study of uterine contractions in low-risk pregnant women. The cohort consisted of 70 women who wore an ambulatory tocodynamometer continuously for three 72-hour periods, four weeks apart, at different gestational ages. Participants completed a diary questionnaire recording physical activities, including sexual activity, during each monitoring period. Results: Women who reported sexual activity in the evening or night experienced significantly increased nocturnal uterine contractions compared with women who did not report sexual activity. In this study, sexual activity during the evening or night appears to accentuate the normal diurnal variation in uterine contractions. Conclusions: This cohort study represents one of the first investigations of uterine contractility within the setting of the normal events of daily living. Although this study cannot address the issue of whether sexual activity precipitates preterm labor, there does appear to be a relationship between uterine contractions and nocturnal sexual activity as experienced in the home environment. The clinical implications of this finding should be evaluated in future studies.

AB  - In a prospective study of 36 pregnancies, the authors made use of the mother's counting of active movements in order to evaluate the correlation between daytime fluctuations in active movements and fetal hypotrophy. With a threshold peak mean evening motor activity no more than 20 p. cent greater than in the morning throughout the period counted, daytime variations were found to have optimal diagnostic capacity for hypotrophy. During the last week preceding delivery, a threshold mean peak evening active movements no more than 35 p. cent greater than in the morning yielded optimum diagnosis of fetal hypotrophy. Furthermore, there was a correlation between daytime fluctuations in active movements and the findings of fetal ultrasound biometry and utero-umbilical flow velocimetry.

AB  - Objective: To establish the profiles of 24-h non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) during the trimesters of pregnancy and the puerperium in normotensive healthy primigravidae. Design: A prospective study in which 24-h ABPM was performed on five occasions in each subject: in the first trimester between 9 and 16 weeks’ gestation; in the second trimester between 18 and 24 weeks; in the third trimester between 26 and 32 weeks and between 33 and 40 weeks; and finally at 6 weeks post partum. Method: One hundred and six Caucasian primigravid women who were normotensive at their first booking visit were recruited consecutively from the antenatal clinic and had 24-h ABPM performed with the SpaceLabs 90207 ambulatory system. Results: Of the 106 women recruited, 98 completed 24-h ABPM on four of the five measurement occasions. Four women delivered prematurely before 33 weeks’ gestation, thereby missing one ABPM measurement. Changes during pregnancy and the puerperium were assessed against the ABPM performed in the first trimester. There was no difference for daytime or night-time systolic blood pressure between 9 and 33 weeks, but it rose significantly from 33 to 40 weeks. At 6 weeks post partum, systolic blood pressure was not significantly different from the daytime pressure in the first-trimester ABPM but was raised significantly at night. Diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly between 18 and 24 weeks for both daytime and night-time. From 33 to 40 weeks it increased in parallel with systolic blood pressure, and at 6 weeks post partum it was raised significantly compared with first-trimester values for daytime and night-time. The nocturnal fall in blood pressure was preserved throughout pregnancy with a significant difference between daytime and night-time measurements present on all measurement occasions for systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures and heart rate. There were significant differences between daytime ABPM and clinic blood pressure for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure up to 33 weeks. From 33 weeks until 6 weeks post partum there was no significant difference between daytime ambulatory and clinic blood pressures. Conclusion: This study provides reference values for ABPM in healthy primigravidae with generally uncomplicated pregnancies. © Current Science Ltd.

AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure recording provides a better understanding of the 24 hours blood pressure profile and its variability. Although this method has been available for many years, its clinical applications have increased during the last decade. Technological advances have made the method reliable, simple and, above all, acceptable to patients; as a result, it has left the laboratory to become an everyday clinical investigation. Ambulatory blood pressure recording allows study of the physiological variations of blood pressure: nocturnal decrease and morning rise... The diagnostic value is maximal in certain well-defined indications: the detection of the 'white coat effect', the evaluation of border-line hypertension or toxaemia of pregnancy, the recording of paroxysmal hypertension or transient hypotension which may escape diagnosis by occasional blood pressure measurements. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring avoids confusion with the placebo effect in the evaluation of an antihypertensive drug and gives an accurate assessment of efficacy, duration of action and of possible rebond effects after stopping the drug. The technique is also useful for comparing two drugs and for evaluating certain drug associations. Finally it opens up new perspectives in the field of chronotherapy.

AB  - We report an HPLC assay for melatonin that incorporates automated injection, methanol/water mobile phase, and fluorescence detection. Plasma samples were extracted by solid and liquid phases. Recovery was >70% for 1- 10 mL of plasma extracted, ~40 pg-250 ng of melatonin. Samples were dried and reconstituted in 100 mL/L methanol. Injections were 25 μL or 150 μL, depending on sample concentration, and the melatonin peak was eluted in 380 mL/L methanol. The detection limit of the assay was 6 pg on the column, allowing a practical sensitivity in plasma of 11 pmol/L for 8-mL samples and 34 pmol/L for 2-mL samples. More than 100 plasma samples from volunteers and patients were assayed and the results compared with an established RIA. The mean daytime concentration of melatonin was 20.7 pmol/L (SEM = 1.2) and 18.5 pmol/L (SEM = 1.6) for HPLC and RIA, respectively, and the mean nighttime concentration was 82.4 pmol/L (SEM = 6.5) and 82.2 (SEM = 7.3), respectively.

AB  - Glucose utilization indices (GUI values) and rates of fatty acid synthesis in interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) varied during the diurnal cycle in virgin and late-pregnant rats permitted unrestricted access to food. In virgin rats, peak GUI values and lipogenic rates were observed at the end of the dark (feeding) phase, but were not sustained during the light phase. Whereas peak GUI values were comparable with those observed during re-feeding after 24 h starvation, maximum rates of IBAT fatty acid synthesis in virgin rats during the diurnal cycle were only approx. 25% of those measured during re-feeding after 24 h starvation. Despite hyperphagia, GUI values during the diurnal cycle in late-pregnant rats fed ad libitum were generally lower than those of age-matched virgin controls. The percentage of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex present in the active form (PDH(a)) was also significantly decreased. Suppression of GUI and PDH(a) was not parallelled by suppression of fatty acid synthesis. IBAT GUI values in late-pregnant rats during chow re-feeding ad libitum after 24 h starvation were only 25% of those of corresponding virgin controls, and stimulation of fatty acid synthesis was also dramatically attenuated. The suppression of IBAT GUI values after re-feeding in pregnancy was not due to depletion of GLUT 4 protein. The results are discussed in relation to the importance of glucose as a precursor for fatty acid synthesis in IBAT.

AB  - The number of identifiable mast cells and the intraluminal area occupied by porphyrin deposits was studied on semithin sections from female hamster Harderian glands during the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Although the serum levels of estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone exhibited significant changes throughout the cycle, no correlation between these changes and the variations in the number of recognizable mast cells was observed. However both during diestrous 1 and proestrous cycles, the number of identifiable mast cells was higher at midnight than at noon (in 14 h light:10 h dark photoperiod with lights on at 07:00 h). A more exhaustive study revealed the presence of 'degranulated mast cells' which were not stained with toluidine blue. Thus, a diurnal cycle in degranulation might occur in the Harderian glands from female hamsters. No significant variations were observed in the area occupied by intraluminal porphyrin deposits during the estrous cycle. However, both the relative number of mast cells and the area occupied by intraluminal porphyrins decreased from day 4 of pregnancy to day 14 showing a strong correlation. The Harderian glands from female Syrian hamsters might provide a useful model for the study of mast cell degranulation during porphyria. © 1993.

AB  - This study reports the results of a detailed investigation of pregnancy in the Djungarian hamster, Phodopus campbelli, with a 2-h time resolution from 2000 h on proestrus (Day 0) through 0600 h on Day 5. Comparisons of the serum levels of progesterone (P4) and estradiol-17β (E2), along with the extractable content of each in the corpora lutea and the nonluteal portion of the right ovary, were used to assess the sources and circulating levels of these steroids throughout preimplantation pregnancy. Simultaneous investigation of embryonic development and location within the reproductive tract permitted accurate staging of development. The time course for development and implantation was similar to that in other short-cycle rodents, with transit into the uterus on the evening of Day 3 and implantation beginning early on Day 5 of pregnancy. In three different circumstances, tissue accumulations of steroids were not associated with concurrent increases in serum levels. The first, late on proestrus to early Day 1 of pregnancy, was a significant accumulation of P4 in the nonluteal ovary while serum levels remained basal. The second, throughout Day 2 of pregnancy, was an accumulation of P4 in the corpora lutea that paralleled the pattern of serum P4 during a normal estrous cycle, but which, in these pregnant females, was not seen as elevated serum P4 levels. This response is likely to be coitally induced and thus advances the first maternal steroid response to pregnancy by 24 h relative to other short-cycle rodents studied. The final divergence between tissue accumulation and serum levels was a gradual accumulation of E2 in the nonluteal ovary on Days 2-5 of pregnancy while serum levels remained nondetectable. These patterns of accumulation versus release may enable the female to support a pregnancy while preparing for a subsequent ovulation.

AB  - During the past few years enormous progress has been made in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in parturition; however, the answer to the fundamental question of how labor is initiated remains elusive. This is a very important question because alterations in the timing of birth (preterm and post-term deliveries) are associated with much of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Currently available treatments for preterm labor are not clearly effective. Prevention of preterm delivery by home uterine monitoring has been proposed; however, the value of this technique has not been conclusively shown. A variety of substances have been implicated in the genesis of labor, including oxytocin, prostaglandins, cytokines, and endothelin. The role of infection in preterm labor has also been extensively studied, but it seems clear that a relatively small percentage of preterm labor is caused by infection. Attention has also focused on the role of estrogen and progesterone, and the possible uses of progesterone antagonists in the induction of labor. A better understanding of the relationship of intrauterine hypoxia and preterm delivery may also help us in establishing treatment and prevention strategies.

AB  - Manipulated the timing of seasonal cycles in red deer hinds by administration of melatonin between July and October and compared the subsequent grazing responses to either a low or high herbage biomass at the times of previously observed seasonal decline (autumn) and rise (spring) in voluntary food intake of enhoused animals. Melatonin treatment resulted in respective 15- and 10-day advances in the timing of the onset and termination of the breeding season of non-pregnant hinds, indicating a phase-shift in the underlying circannual rhythm of reproduction. Melatonin also caused a significant depression in herbage intake by hinds grazing high herbage biomasses during autumn consistent with an advance in the timing of the seasonal appetite decline. Treatment did not affect the intake of hinds on the low biomasses in the autumn or animals on either pasture during spring. Endogenous seasonal appetite changes thus influence level of food intake in grazing deer, but the expression of these seasonal cycles is dependent upon food availability. -from Authors

AB  - In a previous study, Meek and Lee (26) found that female meadow voles mated within three distinct time periods after pairing with a male, and fertility was influenced by the time of mating and photoperiod. In the present studies, we tested the hypothesis that different patterns of mating would correlate with high and low fertility. We found two very different patterns of mating were correlated with high fertility. Females housed in long daylengths (long day; 14 h light/day) and mating within 48 h of pairing with a male, received few mounts, intromissions, and intromissions per ejaculatory series, with very short interintromission intervals. All long-day females utilizing this mating pattern ovulated, and 86-100% produced litters. We suggest this pattern of mating is associated with spontaneous estrus. In contrast to long-day females mating within 48 h, females housed in short daylengths (short day; 10 h light/day) and mating between 14-48 h after pairing with a male, received significantly more short mounts and intromissions, with longer interintromission intervals. These short day females all ovulated and 86% produced litters. We suggest that this pattern of mating is associated with an induced estrus. Short-day females that did not exhibit this pattern of mating (66%) produced far fewer litters. We discuss two mechanisms by which fertility may be inhibited in most short-day females. © 1993.

AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is being widely used now that relatively simple, reliable and well-tolerated, non-invasive blood pressure measuring devices have become available. The following recommendations are only to help physicians to use this technique in their daily practice: - only use homologated devices; - ambulatory monitoring should be performed during normal, everyday activities; - at least one measurement of blood pressure should be taken every 1/4 hour during the daytime (7 h-22 h) and every 1/2 hour during the night (22 h-7 h); - the arm must be absolutely still and relaxed during the measurement; - the function of the measuring device should be checked when the patient is fitted up and when the device is removed; - data processing should provide at least: - all values of blood pressure and heart rate, and their times of measurement, - the mean values of systolic end diastolic blood pressure and heart rate during the day and during the night, - the maximal and minimal systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, - a chronogramme of the values. Reasonable indications of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring include: - elimination of the 'white coat' effect; - to confirm the diagnosis of borderline hypertension; - to demonstrate inversion of diurnal rhythm in severe hypertension; - to demonstrate episodic hyper or hypotension; - to confirm certain cases of toxaemia of pregnancy. It is also justified in the evaluation of antihypertension therapy, especially in cases of suspected drug-resistance.

AB  - We have studied the effects of independently altering the time of darkness and the phase of the daily melatonin rhythm during a 12-h photoperiod on the diurnal rhythms of fetal breathing movements (FBMs), low voltage electrocortical activity, and maternal and fetal plasma concentrations of PRL.Thirteen pregnant ewes were pinealectomized at 99-100 days gestation and held under a normal lighting regime (12-h photoperiod, lights off at 1900 h) until 135 days gestation. All ewes were then exposed to an altered lighting regime (12-h photoperiod, lights off at 1100 h) until 145 days gestation. Six of these ewes were infused with melatonin (12-15 µg/h iv) from 1100 h for 12 h each day between 125 and 135 days gestation while in the normal lighting regime, and from 1900 h while in the altered lighting regime. The remaining seven ewes were infused with saline at corresponding times.Infusion of melatonin produced a significant daily rhythm in maternal and fetal melatonin concentrations; concentrations were highest throughout the 12-h infusion period in each lighting regime.In the normal lighting regime (i.e. lights off at 1900 h) the peak incidence of FBM occurred at between 1000 and 1300 h in the ewes infused with saline or melatonin. Under the altered lighting conditions there was no 24-h variation in the incidence of FBMs in the saline- infused group, but a significant daily variation was present in the melatonin-infused group with peak incidence occurring at 1900-2200 h.The daily variation in maternal PRL concentrations was not affected by changes in the time of onset of melatonin infusion but was different in each of the two lighting regimes. In the normal lighting regime, PRL concentrations were highest at 2100 h (56.2 ± 21.6 ng/ml) whereas in the altered lighting conditions the peak in maternal PRL occurred at 1700 h (90.4 ± 25.1 ng/ml). The daily variation in fetal PRL concentrations was also not affected by changes in the time of onset of melatonin infusion but was different in the two lighting regimes; in the normal lighting regime, fetal PRL reached a peak (13.0 ± 3.7 ng/ml) at 0100-0300 h whereas in the altered lighting regime the peak (29.2 ± 9.8 ng/ml) occurred at 1700-2100 h. We have presented evidence therefore that the daily melatonin rhythm may entrain the daily rhythm in fetal breathing activity. In contrast, diurnal variations in maternal and fetal PRL concentrations are present in pinealectomized ewes, are unaltered by changes in the phase of the daily melatonin rhythm and appear to be under the control of the external light-dark cycle. © 1993 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Different mechanisms may play a role in the pathogenesis of the generalized osteopenia found in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We measured the calcium, osteocalcin (BGP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin (CT) and 25(OH)D3 levels as well as urine 24 hr calcium, Ca/Cr and OHP/Cr in a homogeneous group of 30 non-disabled patients (10 men, 8 premenopausal women and 12 postmenopausal women) recently diagnosed as having RA (disease duration 4 to 6 months). They had normal serum levels of vitamin K, were not on previous or present treatments known to interfere with calcium metabolism, and were not pregnant if females of fertile age. The group was compared with an age-matched control group of 32 healthy subjects (10 men, 8 premenopausal women and 14 postmenopausal women). We observed significantly decreased levels of 25(OH)D3 (29.9 ± 9.9 vs 48.7 ± 12.1 ng/mL; p&lt;0.005) and significantly increased levels of urine OHP/Cr (2.24 ± 0.71 vs 1.56 ± 0.82 mg/mg; p&lt;0.001) in the RA group. No differences in these two parameters were found between the three subgroups of RA patients. Male RA patients showed decreased levels of serum BGP (7.3 ± 1.0 vs 8.2 ± 1.7 ng/mL; p&lt;0.01). The remaining parameters did not differ significantly between RA patients and controls. These data suggest that the generalised osteopenia found in RA may be a consequence of increased bone resorption without a concomitant increase in bone formation, perhaps related to mechanisms inherent to the disease.

AB  - Epidemiological studies demonstrate that the incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) is age-dependent being rare prior to age 10, unusual prior to age 15, with a peak in the mid 20s. It has been suggested that the manifestation of MS is dependent upon having passed through the pubertal period. In the present communication, I propose that critical changes in pineal melatonin secretion, which occur in temporal relationship to the onset of puberty, are intimately related to the timing of onset of the clinical manifestations of MS. Specifically, it is suggested that the fall in melatonin secretion during the prepubertal period, which may disrupt pineal-mediated immunomodulation, may stimulate either the reactivation of the infective agent or increase the susceptibility to infection during the pubertal period. Similarly, the rapid fall in melatonin secretion just prior to delivery may account for the frequent Occurrence of relapse in MS patients during the postpartum period. In contrast, pregnancy, which is associated with high melatonin concentrations, is often accompanied by remission of symptoms. Thus, the presence of high melatonin levels may provide a protective effect, while a decline in melatonin secretion may increase the risk for the development and exacerbation of the disease. The melatonin hypothesis of MS may explain other epidemiological and clinical phenomena associated with the disease such as the low incidence of MS in the black African and American populations, the inverse correlation with sun light and geomagnetic field exposure, the occurrence of relapses in relation to seasonal changes and fluctuations in mood, and the association of MS with affective illness and malignant disease. Therapeutically, this hypothesis implies that application of bright light therapy or the use of other major synchronizers of circadian rhythms such as sleep deprivation or application of external weak magnetic fields may be beneficial in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of relapses in the disease. © 1993 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - Genetic risk is a primary contributing factor to the predisposition of a newborn child to elevated blood pressure later in life. An index of this factor is needed to assess in the neonate the success or failure of preventive interventions instituted for the pregnant women. This index could be based on characteristics of blood pressure and heart rate variability measured during the first 2 days after birth. In the search for such an index, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rates of 127 newborn babies were automatically monitored at about 30-min intervals for 48 h with a Nippon Colin device, starting early after birth. Circadian parameters (obtained by the linear least-squares fit of a 24-h cosine curve to each individual series) and descriptive statistics for the three circulatory variables were used in a multiple regression analysis to compute a linear prediction function for the cardiovascular risk score. This score was obtained for each neonate on the basis of the presence or absence of overt cardiovascular disease, elevated blood pressure, or obesity across two generations, those of the newborn's parents and grandparents. Results from regression indicate that the best model includes the circadian amplitudes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the circadian ranges of systolic blood pressure and heart rate. The contributions from patroclinous versus matroclinous family history were then compared. Results show that linear prediction models include the same variables for both paternal and maternal cardiovascular risk score. These results provide a neonatal index of cardiovascular risk, to be used later for the evaluation of the effects on the newborn of intervention for the pregnant women. © 1993 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - Six rhesus monkeys, fetectomized at 122-129 days gestational age (dGA), were studied to evaluate photoperiod-dependent differences in the myometrial sensitivity to exogenous oxytocin in the absence of a live fetus. One to two weeks before the study, at 150-162 dGA, sixteen maternal arterial samples were taken every 4 h to assess plasma concentrations as well as the presence of 24-h rhythmicity in plasma estradiol and cortisol. At 160-172 dGA, oxytocin was administered via the maternal inferior vena cava to elicit regular myometrial contractions. Each animal was studied twice: once during daylight and once during the early hours of darkness. Oxytocin was infused in a pulsatile fashion during the first minute out of every five over four consecutive 30-min intervals, during which the dose rate was increased after each 6-h oxytocin pulse (400, 800, 2000, and 4000 pg · kg-1 · min-1). The overall response of the myometrium of the fetectomized animals, evaluated as the number of contractions per pulse of oxytocin, was higher during the daytime study (p = 0.006). The response to oxytocin in intact pregnant animals is greatest during the early hours of darkness. Comparison of the overall myometrial response of the fetectomized monkeys with the response of intact pregnant animals showed that the daytime responses were similar, but that the nighttime response of the fetectomized animals was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.0002). These contrasting findings may be due to differences in the maternal neuroendocrine environment depending on the presence or absence of a fetal adrenal steroid contribution acting directly on the myometrium or acting indirectly through provision of precursors for estrogen formation. Estradiol concentrations were 30-50% lower than those reported for intact pregnant animals. No 24-h estradiol rhythm could be determined in any of the six animals, and peak values occurred unrelated to the significant 24-h plasma cortisol rhythm. We hypothesize that in the intact pregnant animal, the fetal adrenal steroid output, highest at night, modulates the myometrial threshold in such a way that during primate pregnancy, the myometrial response to oxytocin is increased during darkness. Conversely, in the fetectomized monkey, the myometrium is less responsive at night than during the day, because this fetal input is lacking.

AB  - Background: Exogenous antigenic peptides are presented to T cells by class II major histocompatibility complex (la) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Class II-associated invariant chain (li) is also required for effective antigen presentation. Because messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for li chain and for class II l-Aβ chain appear in the mouse intestinal epithelium after weaning, experiments were conducted to test the effect of age of weaning and diet on the appearance of la and li mRNA. Methods: Four litters were split at day 17; one half was weaned and the other remained with the mother until day 24. On day 23, 25, 27, and 29, enterocytes were isolated from full-length small intestine by vascular perfusion with 30 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and the RNA was extracted. Results: Appearance of li and l-Aβ was significantly delayed by late weaning, as judged by RNA hybridization blots (li chain) and complementary DNA amplification (l-Aβ chain). In mice on elemental diets, the appearance of li and l-Aβ chain was delayed compared with littermates reared on standard chow, li mRNA failed to appear in mice maintained on the elemental diet by day 40, despite normal growth. Conclusions: Appearance of mRNA for both la and li depends on the introduction of a complex diet and not the "stress" of weaning or elimination of breast milk. Introduction of foreign dietary antigens or development of an altered intestinal flora may contribute to this process. © 1993.

AB  - Chronically prepared near-term fetal lambs (129-133 days gestation) were exteriorized into a saline bath under maternal spinal anesthesia, and each head was rigidly connected to a stereotaxic frame. Multibarrel glass electrodes were inserted into the region of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) during fetal breathing (FB) in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Of a total of 223 neurons, it was possible to record only 6 neurons for which firing amplitude did not change during the transition from REM to non-REM (NREM) sleep. The burst frequency, number of spikes per breath, and association with diaphragmatic activity were variable, with phasic activity preceding FB or disappearing and reappearing during FB. During the transition from REM to NREM sleep, phasic neuronal activity ceased, became tonic, and finally ceased altogether. L-Glutamate increased the number of spikes per breath and caused previous phasic activity to reappear but in NREM sleep produced only tonic activity. We conclude that during REM sleep the fetal respiratory neurons in the region of the NTS are to a large degree influenced by nonrespiratory REM sleep factors and that quiescence of respiratory neurons during NREM sleep is due to the lack of phasic input rather than to direct inhibition. Inhibition of FB during NREM sleep must occur upstream of the NTS neuron.

AB  - Objective To investigate the relation between hourly fetal urine production rate (HFUPR) and behavioural states 1F and 2F (corresponding to quiet and active sleep, respectively) in normal near term fetuses. Design An observational study. Setting A clinic for antenatal care at a university hospital. Subjects Nineteen healthy pregnant women examined at 37 to 40 weeks of gestation. Main outcome measures Fetal behavioural states (1F and 2F) were assessed by means of fetal heart rate patterns (FHR A and FHR B). Using real time ultrasonography, HFUPR (ml/h) was estimated during behavioural states 1F and 2F. Results During behavioural state 1F, HFUPR was significantly higher than during state 2F (P<0.01). HFUPR falls by 47% from 50.8 ± 24.4 ml/h in state 1F to 25.7 ± 15.0 ml/h in state 2F. Conclusions During active sleep (state 2F) hourly fetal urine production rate is considerably reduced as compared to quiet sleep (state 1F). Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - In order to understand the mechanisms which regulate and control basal heart rate as well as heart rate variability in the fetus, a number of studies have been conducted in fetal animals. Information has been obtained largely from fetal sheep during the last third of gestation, although recently investigators have directed their attention to earlier gestations, such as 80-90 days, with term in the sheep being 145 days. A few studies have focused on the non-human primate fetus for additional information. A variety of techniques has been utilized experimentally to produce hypoxemia and/or acidemia in fetal animals, including umbilical cord compression, maternal hypoxemia, and uterine blood flow restrictions. Evidence to date would indicate that both chemoreceptors and baroreceptors are present and active in the late gestation sheep fetus, giving rise to acute changes in fetal heart rate (FHR) with changes in oxygenation. Factors which must be considered in interpreting alterations in both mean FHR and FHR variability in response to a decrease in oxygenation include: 1) the mechanism giving rise to decrease in oxygen delivery, 2) the duration of hypoxemia and/or asphyxia, 3) the effect of sleep states and behavioural activity, 4) gestational age, and 5) condition of the fetus prior to the decrease in oxygen delivery. Heart rate variability in fetal sheep has been studied extensively and it has been shown that accelerations in the FHR are closely associated with skeletal muscle activity much like the human fetus, suggesting similar control mechanisms in the 2 species. The late gestation sheep fetus consistently and reliably experiences an increase in heart rate variability with acute hypoxemia with and without acidemia until severe acidosis develops. In contrast, the hypoxemic human fetus, prior to labour, generally exhibits a decrease in FHR variability. The explanation for this apparent species difference remains unclear.

AB  - Objective To assess the effectiveness of second trimester 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement as a screening test for pre‐eclampsia. Design Prospective interventional study. Setting John Radcliffe Maternity Hospital, Oxford, and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London. Subjects One hundred and sixty‐two normotensive nulliparous women recruited at hospital booking clinics. Intervention Ambulatory blood pressure was measured at 18 and 28 weeks gestation using the TM2420 monitor. Main outcome measure The development of pre‐eclampsia. Results Awake systolic and mean arterial pressures were significantly increased (P<0.02) at 18 weeks in those who later developed pre‐eclampsia. Those differences were more apparent at 28 weeks at which time the diastolic pressure was also increased (P<0.01). At both stages of gestation the higher readings were sustained during sleep so that the awake‐sleep differences were similar in relation to each outcome. The group with incipient pre‐eclampsia had a significantly faster heart rate at both 18 and 28 weeks (P<0.002) The sensitivity in predicting pre‐eclampsia for a mean arterial pressure of 85 mmHg or greater at 28 weeks was 65%, with a positive predictive value of 31 %. The sensitivity and positive predictive value for a test combining a mean arterial pressure of 85 mmHg or greater and a heart rate of 90 bpm or greater were 53% and 45%, respectively. Conclusion Although second trimester ambulatory blood pressure is significantly increased in women who later develop pre‐eclampsia, the predictive values for blood pressure alone are low. The efficiency of the test is increased by combining the awake ambulatory heart rate and blood pressure measurement together. If an effective method for preventing pre‐eclampsia becomes available (commencing at 28 weeks gestation), then awake ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate may have some clinical value as a screening test.

AB  - Study objective: To describe the psychological and functional consequences of miscarriage in women after emergency department treatment and to identify variables that are associated with feelings of loss and grief. Design: A prospective telephone follow-up study. Setting: The ED of an urban teaching hospital. Type of participants: A consecutive sample of 44 women who were treated for miscarriage. Main results: Women were contacted a median of 17.5 days after their miscarriage. Although the pregnancy had been planned by only 12 women (28%), 30 (70%) stated they wanted the pregnancy once they knew they were pregnant. Women commonly felt a sense of loss (82%) and most experienced some limitations with daily functioning (77%). Although wanting the pregnancy was associated with a sense of loss, 40% of the women who did not want the pregnancy experienced loss. Conclusion: Grief reactions are pervasive after spontaneous miscarriage. There is no subgroup of women who could be expected not to experience loss and grief. The ED management of the woman who miscarries should address the anticipated loss and grief. © 1993 American College of Emergency Physicians. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Previous studies in human infants, rabbits, and rats have shown that states of sleep and wakefulness can be reliably identified from motility signals produced by respiration and body movement. Thoman has described a computer-scoring algorithm for automated scoring of behavioral states from motility signals in human infants. In the present studies, we report the use of the computer scoring program with motility signals obtained from electronic activity monitors. In the newborn rabbit, computer classification of the data into behavioral states agreed with visual scoring of the motility signals. In infant and adult rats, computer scoring across the entire age range was validated against direct behavioral observations, video-taped observations, and visual scoring of the motility signal. This procedure permits prolonged recordings of freely moving animals and eliminates the need for an observer to be present. © 1993.

AB  - A hypothesis, and supporting evidence, is presented for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Our model is as follows. Fetal hemoglobin levels are abnormally elevated in SIDS infants, which contributes to a state of chronic hypoxia. Chronic hypoxia produces pronounced depressive effects on the respiratory system during slow wave sleep (a state of normal respiratory depression). These depressive effects are particularly manifest during that period of development in which slow wave sleep begins to occupy a very large percentage of total sleep time in infants - 2-4 mo of age. A downward spiral is initiated in slow wave sleep such that hypoxia-induced decreases in ventilation produce more extreme hypoxia leading to further respiratory depression and ultimately death due to a cessation of respiration. © 1993 Pergamon Press Ltd.

AB  - Two-hour hypobaric hypoxia of rats on day 15 of their pregnancy led to a reduction in weight gain of pups within 20 days after birth, disturbed memory in active and passive paradigms, changed adaptive behaviour in the extrapolatory water avoidance test, and impaired sleep in adult animals. Postnatal treatment with sodium hydroxybutyrate given in a dose of 50 mg/kg/day on days 8 to 20 of life normalized mnestic functions of the brain, the process of falling asleep, and physical development which had been impaired by intrauterine hypoxia.

AB  - The physiology of parturition, and the pathophysiology of preterm labor, is incompletely understood. Infection of gestational tissues may account for a significant proportion of women who experience preterm labor. Interleukin-8 (IL-8), or neutrophil-activating protein (NAP-1), is a potent chemotactic and activating factor for neutrophils and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory injury to skin and lung, but has yet to be described in gestational tissues. Cultured chorion and decidual cells obtained from normal human pregnancies were used to evaluate whether these tissues produce IL-8 basally and in response to inflammatory cytokines. As measured by specific IL-8 RIA, chorion and decidual cells produce IL-8 constitutively and in response to IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor. Cotreatment of chorion cells or decidual cells with IL-1β and actinomycin D or cycloheximide abrogated IL-8 production. Northern blot analysis confirmed that IL-1β stimulation of chorion and decidual cells resulted in increased IL-8 messenger RNA expression. Our data support the concept that a complex cytokine network between maternal and fetal gestational tissues exists, and that activation of inflammatory cytokine production in these tissues, including IL-8, likely contributes to the pathophysiology of infection-induced preterm labor. © 1993 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Chronically prepared fetal sheep were subjected to 48 h infusions of theophylline, an adenosine antagonist, enprofylline, a xanthine without adenosine antagonism, or saline. Theopylline increased mean (±SD) incidence of REM sleep from 49.3 ± 8.3% to 57.3% ± 6.7% (p<0.02) and wakefulness from 1.3 ± 1.4% to 8.1 ± 7.1% (p<0.01). On the first day of theophylline infusion incidence of fetal breathing (FB) increased from 37.9 ± 8.1% to 53.7 ± 11.6% of total time (p<0.002) and from 76.4 ± 10.2% to 87.6 ± 10.3% of REM sleep (p<0.02). Diaphragmatic EMG/min increased from 6.9 ± 4.0 to 17.3 ± 13 arbitrary units (p<0.02). By the second day of infusion, FB had returned to baseline value. Enprofylline and saline had no effect. 125 μg phenyl isopropyl adenosine (PIA) i.v. caused fetal apnea that was reduced from 143 ± 45.5 min on the control day to 39.8 ± 34.7 min (p<0.001) during theophylline infusion. Enprofulline and saline had no effect, suggesting that the observed theophylline effect was due to its adenosine antagonism rather than to non-specific xanthine action. We conclude endogenous adenosine suppresses FB, but since theophylline did not alter the basic relationship between FB and REM sleep it is not primarily responsible for apnea during NREM sleep. © 1993.

AB  - Radiation doses to the family and genera] public from 131I therapy of outpatients were assessed for comparison with the 1990 International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) dose limits. Doses to family members of such patients, measured by previous workers, were converted to show that on average 5.6 + 3.7 μSv MBq-1is received by the spouse and 1.5 ± 0.87 μSv MBq-1by other family members. It was deduced that the average dose to the spouse (D μ-SV MBq-1) when couples sleep apart for T days after administration is given by: D = 2.528 + 3.072e-o11Tif an effective half-life, T<inf>off</inf>, of 6.35 days is used. The cumulative effect of repeated treatments should be considered and in view of ALARA it is recommended that couples sleep apart for at least 14 days after each administration, even if this is below limits permitted by authorities. The dose to a pregnant colleague or family member other than the wife should be below 2 mSv if the total administered activity is not more than 600 MBq. If the wife is pregnant, couples should sleep apart for at least 30 days after administration. © 1993 Chapman and Hall Ltd.

AB  - In utero exposure to alcohol has been associated with many physical deficits and behavioral abnormalities. The purpose of these studies was to determine the effects of in utero administration of alcohol on behaviors related to tolerance and sensitivity to alcohol in adult rats. Pregnant rats were maintained on a liquid diet containing alcohol [35% ethanol-derived calories (EDC)] throughout pregnancy. Offspring manifested physical characteristics of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The 35% EDC group was able to stay on a wooden dowel longer and at higher blood alcohol concentrations than were pair-fed controls. Following a hypnotic dose of alcohol, rats in the 35% EDC group slept longer than pair-fed controls. A greater alcohol-induced hypothermic effect was seen in females in the 35% EDC group than in controls. Treatment did not affect rate of metabolism of alcohol. These studies suggest that in utero administration of alcohol may be a factor in determining an individual's sensitivity and tolerance to alcohol and possibly their preference for alcohol. © 1993.

AB  - Cocaine use by pregnant women has been reported to cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that human neonates exposed to cocaine via maternal use during pregnancy might manifest changes in beat- to-beat heart rate variability, similar to those described in experimental animals. In this preliminary report, we present findings from the first systematic analysis of heart rate dynamics in a small group of (n = 5) neonates exposed in utero to cocaine compared to gestationally age matched controls (n = 6) without known drug exposure. Overall heart rate spectral power during ten minute periods of quiescent sleep was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in the cocaine-exposed group, reminiscent of the changes recently reported in an animal model. In two other cocaine-exposed newborns, a quiescent sleep period could not be found. We discuss the special methodological problems associated with collection and interpretation of such data.

AB  - We describe three fetuses at term that demonstrated abnormal behavioral patterns in utero when observed using real-time ultrasound. The abnormal patterns turned out to have neurologic correlations after birth. In case 1, despite a normal breathing pattern, no movement in any of the four extremities was observed, thus suggesting the existence of a spinal cord lesion at the rostral end, located at C4 or C5. In case 2 a lack of breathing movement was noted repeatedly, together with the abnormal finding that alternation of periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with those of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was not present. These findings implied a lesion involving the pons and/or medulla oblongata. In case 3 movement of the four extremities, breathing movement, and alternating periods of REM sleep and NREM sleep were found to be within the normal range. The concurrence of regular mouthing and the NREM sleep period was not observed, however, suggesting impairment in the brain function responsible for NREM sleep located from the pons through the thalamocortical connection to the cerebral hemisphere.

AB  - Little is known about the developmental profile of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the developing human brain, despite the potential importance of such information in understanding the pathogenesis of neurological abnormalities or increased risk for the sudden infant death syndrome in offspring exposed to nicotine in utero. In this study, we determined the distribution of [3H]nicotine binding in the developing human brainstem by quantitative tissue autoradiography. In midgestational fetuses, [3H]nicotine binding sites were heavily concentrated in tegmental nuclei related to cardiopulmonary integration, arousal, attention, rapid eye movement sleep, and somatic motor control. Over the last half of gestation, [3H]nicotine binding decreased 60-70% in the tegmental nuclei, with a significant difference in binding between midgestation and early infancy. In contrast, there was essentially no change in [3H]nicotine binding in the major cerebellar-relay nuclei (principal inferior olive and griseum pontis) between the same time-points. Tritium quenching by increasing lipid (myelin) content in tissue sections did not account for the decreases in [3H]nicotine binding in tegmental nuclei. Based upon the high levels of [3H]nicotine binding at midgestation, combined with experimental data demonstrating trophic properties for acetylcholine, we postulate that nAChRs play a role in the development of the brainstem tegmentum during this period, and that once this role is fulfilled, nicotinic cholinergic binding decreases and remains low thereafter. Alternatively, nicotinic cholinergic receptors may be critical for other developmentally related functions and/or neurotransmission in the brainstem tegmentum at midgestation. The high levels of [3H]nicotine binding in the brainstem tegmentum at midgestation and its rapidly changing profile over late gestation further suggest that mid-to-late gestation is a developmental period during which this region is likely to be most vulnerable to the harmful effects of nicotine in maternal cigarette smoke. The baseline information provided in this study is potentially relevant towards understanding attention deficits and risk for the sudden infant death syndrome in offspring exposed to cigarette smoke in utero. © 1993.

AB  - In a cross-sectional epidemiological study of headache disorders information on precipitating factors, age at onset, influence of menstruation and pregnancy and use of oral contraceptives was collected. The presence of migraine and tension-type headache was ascertained by a clinical interview and examination using the operational diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society. The prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache was also analysed in relation to variables of lifestyle: physical activity, smoking, consumption of coffee, alcohol intake and sleep pattern. In both migraine and tension-type headache, the most conspicuous precipitating factor was stress and mental tension. Other common precipitants were alcohol, weather changes and menstruation. Disappearance or substantial improvement of the headache during pregnancy was more frequent in migraineurs than in tension-type headache sufferers. The age at onset of both migraine and tension-type headache differs between men and women. Female hormones may be an important factor responsible for the sex difference of headache disorders. The level of physical activity showed no association with migraine, but a significantly higher prevalence of tension-type headache in men with exclusively sedentary activity emerged. Smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption showed no significant associations with the headache disorders. Sleep pattern was significantly associated with migraine and tension-type headache in both univariate and multivariate analyses. In conclusion, migraine and tension-type headache seem to be different with regard to a number of endogenous and exogenous factors. © 1993.

AB  - 86 women who suffered from a psychotic disorder for the first time in their life within 6 weeks after parturition, were investigated regarding sociodemographic and gynaecological parameters, time of onset and initial symptomatology, psychopathological symptoms during hospitalisation, treatment and short-term outcome of the illness. The majority of patients became ill after the first (75%), full-term normal (63%) delivery and within the first two postpartum weeks (78%). The most frequent initial symptoms were anxiety, restlessness, depressive mood, sleep disturbances, behaviour disturbances, catatonic excitement, delusions and hallucinations. By the time of follow-up investigation, 16 women had died; 61 women were investigated on average 25.6 years after onset (minimum 12, maximum 41 years), using standardised instruments of evaluation. Nearly two-thirds of the patients had suffered remanifestation of psychotic disorder during a long-term course (64%). The frequency of remanifestations of illness after additional pregnancies and deliveries was found to be 1:4, which is also known to be the expected frequency during the course of other psychotic disorders. These results do not justify the global recommendation to avoid additional pregnancies or carry out an interruption of pregnancy, if the patient has a history of postpartum psychosis. The climacteric period also seems to be a vulnerable phase for the remanifestation of illness. Nearly 3/4 of the investigated women displayed no disturbances in any of the evaluated dimensions (psychopathological, psychological, psychosocial status) at the time of follow-up.

AB  - We examined 96 normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation to determine the relationship between the duration of the active state following a single vibroacoustic stimulus (VAS) and the time spent in prestimulus state 1F, i.e. quiet sleep (QS). All fetuses were observed to enter state 1F prior to testing. After remaining in this state for 3 min, each fetus was randomized into one of three groups: no stimulation (Group I, N = 32); a single 1-s VAS delivered after 3-5 min of QS (Group II, N = 33); and a single 1-s VAS delivered after 18-20 min of QS (Group III, N = 31). Fetuses in Groups I, II, and III were otherwise behaviourally indistinguishable. Heart rate and eye and body movements were monitored until the fetus either returned to state 1F and remained in that state for 3 min or did not return to state 1F within 60 min. Of the 64 fetuses who were stimulated, 62 responded, indicating that there was no effect of prestimulus state duration on the sensitivity to VAS. Fetuses stimulated after 18-20 min of QS behaved similarly to fetuses who entered an active period spontaneously. However, fetuses who were in QS for 3-5 min remained in a more active state for a significantly shorter length of time than did fetuses who either had been in QS for 18-20 min before VAS (17.9 min vs. 38.0 min, P = 0.0002) or had entered an active period spontaneously (17.9 min vs. 41.1 min, P = 0.0001); 10 (30.3%) fetuses in Group II and two (6.5%) fetuses in Group III were active for ≤ 3 min following VAS (P = 0.015). Even when the 10 fetuses in Group II who did not make a state change were excluded from analysis, the mean duration of the active period was significantly less for Group II fetuses than for fetuses in either Groups I (P = 0.0010) or III (P = 0.0058). We conclude that, for fetuses who were otherwise behaviourally indistinguishable at the time of stimulation, the nature of the behavioural response following a single VAS was dependent upon the prestimulus duration of state 1F. © 1993.

AB  - It is well known that prenatal stress induces behavioral demasculinization and/or feminization in male offspring during adulthood. In this study, four different stressors were prenatally applied to rats. Pregnant rats were subjected to immobilization, unavoidable electric foot shocks, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REMd), or immersion in cold water. During adulthood, male offspring were tested for masculine and feminine sexual behavior. The results corroborated the fact that immobilization induced an impairment of masculine sexual behavior and a facilitation of feminine sexual behavior. Electric shocks showed only minor differences in masculine behavior when compared to intact controls, and no signs of lordosis behavior were observed. The REMd group displayed a major impairment of masculine behavior, even greater than that observed within the immobilization group. However, lordosis behavior was only induced with estradiol. On the other hand, water immersion seems to have a facilitatory effect on several parameters of masculine behavior and did not show lordosis behavior even with hormonal treatment. These results strongly suggest that changes in sex behavior induced by prenatal stress are linked to the nature of the stressor. © 1993.

AB  - Autonomic and behavioral response to fear stimulation (sudden noise 80 dB) was studied in 12 sleeping infants at ages 8–50 weeks. The aim of the present study was to identify a possible passive defense response in infants. The response, which is widespread in birds and mammals, is characterized by apnea and bradycardia with circulatory changes as seen during the forced diving response. Upon stimulation, two respiratory responses were elicited: apnea preceded by irregular respiration or simple irregular respiration. Apnea was elicited in 58% of stimulations at ages 8–16 weeks compared to 14% at 28–50 weeks. The mean duration of apnea decreased from 7.8 s(± 1.8 s) at 8–13 weeks to 4.7s (± 1.1s) at 17–20 weeks. The preceding irregular respiration increased from 5.3 s (± 4.4 s) to 10.6 s (± 5.4 s) at the same ages. The heart rate response was biphasic and were interpreted as the orienting response. The mean deceleration in relation to apnea was 16% at 8–16 weeks and was reduced to 8% at 28–50 weeks. Infants of smoking mothers were more prone to respond with apnea than infants of nonsmoking mothers (73% versus 38%). REM sleep and long postprandial sleep time increased the probability of apnea response (62% versus 38% and 66% versus 35%). The responses seen may be interpreted as expressions of the passive defense response. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The existing knowledge on the functional development of the fetus' central nervous system (CNS) in uncomplicated pregnancy is summarized. It is advocated that the current techniques to study normal prenatal neurology are used for testing behavioural teratogenicity in man. Any substance potentially noxious to the CNS, should ideally be subjected to this method of testing. Such a study, though extensive and time-consuming, is feasible. This is shown using diabetes mellitus as an example. Maternal diabetes poses a risk to the developing fetus. The risk for structural malformations of the CNS is increased. Abnormal functional development of the fetal nervous system exists also in diabetic pregnancy, even when well controlled. Indicative of this are a delayed emergence of fetal movement patterns in the first trimester of pregnancy, altered regulation of fetal breathing movements, delayed and/or disturbed emergence of fetal behavioural states ('sleep-wake' cycles) in the third trimester and, in the neonatal period, continuity of poor behavioural state organization, immature EEG patterns and a high incidence of periodic breathing.

AB  - The authors report on a 12-year old boy with a past history of impaired respiratory control during sleep secondary to extensive thrombosis of cerebral veins at age 6, requiring continuous ventilation during sleep, and severe psychological problems and self-destructive behaviour with onset in early childhood. Although schooling was impossible, the child was judged to have a normal intellectual level. Frequent absence seizures with atonic falls and numerous injuries occurred during a worsening of the psychological situation, triggered by the announcement by the parents of a new pregnancy and by neuroleptic treatment with fluphenazine. Clinical and polygraphic-video monitoring showed that the boy used a Valsalva maneuvre to repeatedly provoke syncopes; these were not associated with a cardiac pause, but only with a steep decline in blood pressure. After a slight bettering of the self-destructive behaviour during a hospital stay, there was a new exacerbation and the boy was found dead one evening in his bed six weeks after the evaluation.

AB  - One-hundred-and-thirty-eight women suffering from hypothalamicor hyperandrogenic ovarian failure were treatedwith daily doses of 25-150 mg of the opiate antagonist naltrexone for 4-100 weeks.In patients with hypothalamicovarian failure, treatment with naltrexone alone was followedby an increase of gonadotrophins and by normalization ofthe menstrual cycle in 70% of patients.Eight of 10 patientswho did not respond to naltrexone and had not previouslyovulated in response to clomiphene administration exhibitedovulatory cycles when both compounds were administered.Twenty-four pregnancies were achieved in 22 women, corresponding to an overall pregnancy rate of 26% with acumulative pregnancy rate closely resembling that of a normalpopulation.In contrast, in hyperandrogenic insulin-resistantpatients, the pattern of gonadotrophin secretion did not seemto change dramatically during naltrexone treatment.However, the rise of insulin in plasma following an oral load of glucose(oGTT)was blunted considerably, resulting innormalization of previously elevated circulating insulin levels.Since the time course of plasma glucose after oGTT did notappear to be affected by treatment, this indicates an increasein insulin sensitivity(or a decrease in insulin resistance)duringnaltrexone therapy.Side-effects of naltrexone treatment werenegligible in patients with hypothalamic ovarian failure.Hyperandrogenic patients, however, did experience moreintense and prolonged side-effects, such as nausea anddizziness.In conclusion, our data demonstrate dramaticeffects of the opiate antagonist naltrexone on gonadotrophinsecretion in hypothalamic ovarian failure and on insulinresistance and hyperandrogenism, suggesting a critical roleof endogenous opioids in the pathogenesis of both disorders.In addition, these findings may provide the basis for newforms of treatment. © 1993 Oxford University Press.

AB  - A carbon dioxide hypersensitivity theory of panic has been posited. We hypothesize more broadly that a physiologic misinterpretation by a suffocation monitor misfires an evolved suffocation alarm system. This produces sudden respiratory distress followed swiftly by a brief hyperventilation, panic, and the urge to flee. Carbon dioxide hypersensitivity is seen as due to the deranged suffocation alarm monitor. If other indicators of potential suffocation provoke panic, this theoretical extension is supported. We broadly pursue this theory by examining Ondine's curse as the physiologic and pharmacologic converse of panic disorder, splitting panic in terms of symptomatology and challenge studies, reevaluating the role of hyperventilation, and reinterpreting the contagiousness of sighing and yawning, as well as mass hysteria. Further, the phenomena of panic during relaxation and sleep, late luteal phase dysphoric disorder, pregnancy, childbirth, pulmonary disease, separation anxiety, and treatment are used to test and illuminate the suffocation false alarm theory. © 1993, American Medical Association.

AB  - We evaluated a program for prevention of preterm birth involving early detection and aggressive intervention with subcutaneous terbutaline pump therapy in a high-risk, private patient population. Risk factor screening, frequent cervical examinations, and intensive patient education were used to detect preterm labor before it progressed to an advanced stage. Home terbutaline pump therapy was prescribed for patients with uterine contractions associated with progressive cervical change, after stabilization with IV magnesium sulfate. In this study of 51 patients, home terbutaline pump therapy was successful in 98% of the cases, prolonging pregnancy an average of 6.6 weeks. Mean gestational age at delivery was 37 ± 1.4 weeks, and infant birth weight averaged 3 kg. Only 22% of infants required admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, with a mean length of stay of 7.25 days. Population factors in this compliant, well- educated patient group may have contributed to the positive outcomes achieved. © 1993 Southern Medical Association.

AB  - During the third trimester of pregnancy there is a gradual development of fetal behavioral states. These states are distinct and discontinuous modes of neural activity; they reflect a certain degree of maturity and/or integrity of the fetal brain and are homologous with those seen in newborn infants. Abnormal state development has been found in growth retarded fetuses and in fetuses of women with type‐1 diabetes. Behavioral state organization is not easily influenced by external factors and most stimuli fail to induce a state change when the fetus is in quiet sleep (state 1F). However, fetuses do react to vibro‐acoustic stimulation (VAS) with an electronic artificial larynx. This stimulus induces excessive fetal movements, prolonged tachycardia, disorganization of behavioral states, and state transitions normally not seen in healthy fetuses. The backgrounds for these excessive and unusual reactions are largely unknown. For the time being, it seems better not to use this device in clinical practice. In this review paper, data on the development of behavioral states and on fetal reactions to VAS are discussed. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Copyright © 1993 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - This study examines the effects of altering the prenatal maternal metabolic and hormonal environment via chronic cold exposure of under-fed ewes on developmental changes in breathing control of developing lambs. Breathing frequency and timing were measured during non rapid-eye-movement (non-REM) sleep in lambs born from either shorn or unshorn ewes after being maintained for at least one hour at warm (28-19°C) and cool (14-5°C) ambient temperatures at 1, 4, 14 and 30 days of age. Breathing frequency and oxygen consumption were significantly higher in 1 day old lambs born from shorn ewes compared with those lambs born from unshorn ewes, at both warm and cool ambient temperatures. In the shorn group breathing frequency decreased between 1 and 4 days of age and continued decreasing up to 30 days of age, during which period inspiratory and to a greater extent expiratory time, lengthened. Laryngeal 'braking' of expiratory airflow was observed in more than 50% of lambs born from shorn ewes during non-REM sleep in the warm at 4, 14 and 30 days of age, and in the cold at 14 and 30 days of age. In contrast, lambs born from unshorn ewes showed no change in breathing frequency between 1 and 4 days of age, but a decrease was observed between 4 and 14 days of age, whilst laryngeal 'braking' of expiratory airflow was rarely observed at any age. It is concluded that the development of breathing control over the first month of postnatal life can be affected by alterations in the fetal environment elicited by chronic cold exposure of the mother.

AB  - Primary dysmenorrhea, secondary dysmenorrhea, and cyclic pelvic pain syndromes represent a special subset of CPP. Although more common and no less debilitating, these conditions are better understood, more easily diagnosed, and more successfully treated than chronic pain states. It should be the expectation of both the physician and the patient that successful resolution of these complaints is possible.

AB  - Objective: To review the literature on fetal vibroacoustic stimulation as a method of changing the fetal sleep state during nonstress testing. Data sources: The MEDLINE data base and reference lists were used to select articles pertaining to human and animal fetal vibroacoustic stimulation. Methods of study selection: We reviewed the English language literature with respect to sound intensity, stimulus duration, and repetition rate as possible means of altering fetal sleep-wake cycles. Data extraction and synthesis: Several criteria have been used to measure fetal response: gestational age, fetal heart rate, fetal movements, fetal breathing movements, fetal habituation, and fetal behavioral states. The use of vibroacoustic stimulation for antepartum and intrapartum fetal assessment and safety issues are also reviewed. Conclusion: Although further research is needed, the ability of vibroacoustic stimulation to elicit FHR accelerations has been established, thus decreasing the false-positive rate associated with nonreactive nonstress testing.

AB  - The present studies investigated the effects of glutathione (GSH; γ‐glutamylcysteinylglycine) and its oxidized form (GSSG) on neuronal N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation in both acute and chronic preparations of ethanol exposure. It was demonstrated using fura‐2‐loaded dissociated brain cells from newborn rat pups that both GSH and GSSG (0–4 mM) produced concentration‐dependent increases in intracellular calcium similar to those produced by NMDA and other agonists of the NMDA receptor. GSH‐stimulated calcium entry was not inhibited by low intoxicating concentrations of ethanol, which contrasts with ethanol's typical inhibitory effect on NMDA‐stimulated receptor activation. Behavioral studies in adult rats demonstrated that ethanol‐induced sleep times were significantly decreased when 10 μl of GSSG (20 mM) were administered intracere‐broventricularly approximately 5 min before an intraperitoneal injection of 20% (w/v) ethanol (3 g/kg). These findings suggest that the less potent effect of ethanol on GSH‐stimulated calcium entry as well as the reduction in ethanol‐induced sleep times may be related to the presence of glycine in the peptide. The glycine found in GSH may activate the glycine site and block or reduce ethanol's action on this site. It appears that although GSH may play an important role in the activation of the NMDA receptor, this action does not involve a process that is sensitive to acute ethanol exposure. In contrast, when rat pups were chronically exposed to ethanol via prenatal exposure before the fura‐2 preparation, increases in NMDA‐ and GSH‐stimulated calcium entry were significantly decreased relative to those in pair‐fed and ad libitum‐fed controls. Thus, chronic in utero exposure to ethanol may alter the NMDA‐receptor complex, such that calcium entry mediated by NMDA or GSH activation is significantly reduced. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - Forty perinatal substance abusers were administered multiple psychosocial, addiction, and psychological measures before beginning treatment. Results indicate that these patients are limited intellectually, educationally, financially, and emotionally. Psychiatric comorbidity was high, with 45% having non-substance abuse axis I diagnoses and 75% having confirmed (by two or more tests) axis II pathology. The most frequently identified axis I disorders were depression and anxiety. The most frequently detected personality disorders were antisocial, borderline, paranoid, and dependent. The average IQ was 87 (low average range) and nearly one third of the sample were found to be somewhat impaired intellectually. These data suggest that treatment programs must take psychological characteristics into account if they are going to succeed in helping these women achieve and maintain abstinence. © 1993 by Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - In the United States, effective malaria prevention strategies for short-term travelers are available. Monitoring trends in imported malaria and continued evaluation of the effectiveness and chemoprophylaxis will allow prevention recommendations to evolve as the risk of infection and effectiveness of antimalarial drugs change. Our challenge is to increase the number of prospective travelers receiving pre-travel advice, to disseminate this information to health care providers, and to improve the quality of the advice given. The early recognition of Plasmodium infection and the institution of prompt and effective treatment will reduce morbidity and mortality from malaria in this country.

AB  - An epidemiological analysis of 38 cases of SIDS was carried out in the Pathology Institute of the University of Milan. Those cases were collected from Milan district in four years, from 1987 to 1991. In 1991 the incidence of cot death in the same district was 0.55 per 1000 live births. This study has led to the following conclusions. Most of SIDS victims were males, mostly aged between 40 and 90 days; the totality (except one case that happened during maternal feeding) of the cases occurred during night sleep; a greater prevalence during winter months was found. We didn't find any correlation between type of feeding and cot death. The weight at birth was mostly satisfactory; often the infants showed mild infections of the upper airways during the days immediately before death. It is possible to hypothesize a correlation between cigarette smoking and between drug abuse (during pregnancy) and cot death. We didn't recognize a significant association between sleeping position of infants and their death nor between type of cushion and cot death. For each case a complete autopsy was carried out. We extended histological findings to cardiac conduction system, to brain-stem (central) and to ganglion structures (peripheric), sites of cardio-respiratory control. In 65.7% of cases we found cardiac conduction system alterations; in 10.5% of cases we observed brain-stem anomalies, sometime these alterations were associated. In one case we noticed an hypertrophy of aorto-pulmonary paraganglia structures.

AB  - Use of addicting drugs among women during pregnancy exposes newborns to potentially serious disorders. A group of symptoms referred to as neonatal withdrawal syndrome (NWS) may occur in infants born to mothers addicted to certain drugs because, at birth, the infants suddenly are cut off from the drug supply. Classes of drugs that cause NWS are those that produce addiction in adults, including the opioids (heroin, methadone, morphine), barbiturates, alcohol, and benzodiazepines. Many of the manifestations of NWS occur regardless of the class of drug, including irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep pattern, high‐pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and failure to gain weight. The fact that these symptoms are nonspecific makes it difficult to identify NWS unless it is specifically looked for. The onset, duration, and severity of the disorder differ based on such factors as the addictive drug used, time and amount of mother's last dose, and rate of elimination of the drug from the newborn. Pharmacologic intervention may be required to control severe symptoms and signs. The most common drugs used to modify withdrawal are phenobarbital, paregoric, chlorpromazine, and diazepam. Treatment is complicated by conflicting information on the effectiveness of various agents. 1993 Pharmacotherapy Publications Inc.

The inhalational gases were self‐administered during contractions over a 3 h study period using a standard Entonox demand valve and breathing system. Isoflurane 0.2% was added from an Ohmeda Isotec drawover vaporizer and the inspired concentration ofisoflurane was analysed continuously using a Datex Ultima analyser. Linear analogue scores for pain were significantly lower (p < 0.001) during the Entonox‐isoflurane administration compared with Entonox alone. Drowsiness was not a clinical problem and there was a high acceptance rate for Entonox‐isoflurane inhalational analgesia during labour. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The work pattern of rural women revolves around a variety of jobs in the home, farm and livestock management. The National perspective Plan (1988) rightly pooints out, ‘For the majority of the women in the country, there is more work than wages, more load titan capacity and more compulsion than choice.’Studies on time utilization pattern (work load) of men and women in rural households in India, though few, indicate that rural women work longer hours than men. A 14–16 h working day is common in certain areas even among pregnant women. Review of the literature however, reveals major gaps in information especially pertaining to work status of rural women and how the time use pattern (workload) varies with their work status and/or agricultural season. The present study was therefore, an attempt in this direction. More specifically, the objectives of the study were: (a) to study time allocation pattern of rural women in work, rest, leisure and sleep and (b) to study the time utilization pattern in various categories of work according to women's work status and agricultural season.

AB  - The number of aircraft movements in our society is increasing at a rapid rate. As a consequence the airspace is becoming more crowded, in particular in the vicinity of airports. As a consequence pollution (both air pollution and noise) near the airports increases. One solution to 'rush hours' in the airspace around airports is to spread the number of flights more evenly over time. This leads to more flights in the sensitive parts of the day: evening and night. This leads to community reaction and places the potential health effects of noise in the focus of societal attention. Human functioning is affected by noise in many ways. Effects of noise become detectable at a relatively low noise level, approx. 30 dB(A). Above which noise levels and under what conditions these effects become threatening to health is still largely unknown. This holds true for cardiovascular effects, mental health, mortality rates, medicine consumption, pregnancy, delivery and physical development. On some aspects more certainty exists. Night time noise when it causes people to wake up or prevents them from falling asleep, or when it frequently disturbs the structure of sleep below the waking level, can be detrimental to health. Both for awakening reactions and for annoyance, exposure-response relations are rather well established. Reading ability is hampered by noise. For the vegetative aspects, no clear and stable exposure-response relations are known at this moment. Hopefully this conference will fill in the gap.

AB  - General pharmacological profiles of OPC-13340, a novel calcium antagonist, were studied in mice, rats, guinea-pigs, rabbits and cats. OPC-13340 showed inhibition of spontaneous motor activity at 30 mg/kg p.o. or more, acetic acid-induced writhing at 100 and 300 mg/kg p.o. and motor coordination at 300 mg/kg p.o. in mice. In conscious rabbits, the drug showed transient increase of the slow wave component of EEG in amygdala at 1 mg/kg i.v. and transient decrease of the amplitude of EEG in cortex and hippocampus at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg intravenously. However, OPC-13340 showed little effect on general behavior, hexobarbital-induced anesthesia and body temperature in mice at doses up to 300 mg/kg p.o. and sleep-wakefulness cycle in rabbits at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg intravenously. The drug did not show anti-convulsant and convulsion-inducing activities at doses up to 300 mg/kg orally. OPC-13340 showed no muscle relaxation in mice at doses up to 300 mg/kg p.o. and exerted no local anesthetic action in guinea-pig cornea at 0.01% and 0.03%. In anesthetized cats, the drug did not affect the neuromuscular transmission at doses up to 3 mg/kg intravenously. OPC-13340 showed little effect on the sympathetic ganglionic transmission in cats at doses up to 3 mg/kg intravenously. In the isolated smooth muscles, OPC-13340 inhibited the spontaneous movement of pregnant rat uterus at 10-8M or more and the spontaneous movement of rabbit ileum and dopamine-induced contraction of guinea-pig vas deferens at 10-7M or more. In addition, OPC-13340 showed non-competitive inhibitions of acetylcholine-, histamine- or barium chloride-induced contraction of guinea- pig ileum, serotonin-induced contraction of rat fundus, norepinephrine- or acetylcholine-induced contraction of guinea-pig vas deferens and oxytocin- induced contraction of non-pregnant rat uterus at 10-8M or more. However, the drug showed no relaxation in the isolated guinea-pig trachea at doses up to 3 x 10-5M. In anesthetized rats, OPC-13340 and nicardipine caused inhibition of the spontaneous movement of non-pregnant uterus at 1 and 3 mg/kg i.v. and pregnant uterus at 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg i.v., although the duration of inhibitory action of OPC-13340 for the uterine movement was longer than that of nicardipine. OPC-13340 inhibited the intestinal propulsion at 30 mg/kg p.o. or more in mice. In anesthetized rats, the drug inhibited intestinal movement at 0.1 mg/kg i.v. or more and gastric movement at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.v. and 100 and 300 mg/kg intraduodenally. OPC-13340 decreased the gastric secretion at 3 and 10 mg/kg intraduodenally. OPC-13340 decreased the urine volume and excretion of urinary Na+, K+ and Cl- in rats at 100 and 300 mg/kg orally. OPC-13340 inhibited the carrageenin- induced paw edema at 30 mg/kg p.o. or more. However, the drug showed no effect on the blood coagulation process at doses up to 300 mg/kg p.o., no hemolytic action at doses up to 10-5M or little eye irritative action at 0.01% and 0.03%. From these results, OPC-13340 was considered to have little effect on the central, somatic and autonomic nervous systems, digestive system and peripheral organs, although the drug showed several effects, which are qualitatively identical with those of other calcium antagonists or vasodilators, at doses 10-100 times higher than that of hypotensive action in vivo or vasodilatory action in vitro.

AB  - In this review, we have summarized various aspects as to how prenatal protein malnutrition affects development of the brain and have attempted to integrate several broad principles, concepts, and trends in this field in relation to our findings and other studies of malnutrition insults. Nutrition is probably the single greatest environmental influence both on the fetus and neonate, and plays a necessary role in the maturation and functional development of the central nervous system. Prenatal protein malnutrition adversely affects the developing brain in numerous ways, depending largely on its timing in relation to various developmental events in the brain and, to a lesser extent, on the type and severity of the deprivation. Many of the effects of prenatal malnutrition are permanent, though some degree of amelioration may be produced by exposure to stimulating and enriched environments. Malnutrition exerts its effects during development, not only during the so-called brain growth spurt period, but also during early organizational processes such as neurogenesis, cell migration, and differentiation. Malnutrition results in a variety of minimal brain dysfunction-type syndromes and ultimately affects attentional processes and interactions of the organism with the environment, in particular producing functional isolation from the environment, often leading to various types of learning disabilities. In malnutrition insult, we are dealing with a distributed, not focal, brain pathology and various developmental failures. Quantitative assessments show distorted relations between neurons and glia, poor formation of neuronal circuits and alterations of normal regressive events, including cell death and axonal and dendritic pruning, resulting in modified patterns of brain organization. Malnutrition insult results in deviations in normal age-related sequences of brain maturation, particularly affecting coordinated development of various cell types and, ultimately, affecting the formation of neuronal circuits and the commencing of activity of neurotransmitter systems. It is obvious that such diffuse type "lesions" can be adequately assessed only by interdisciplinary studies across a broad range of approaches, including morphological, biochemical, neurophysiological, and behavioral analyses. © 1993 Pergamon Press Ltd.

AB  - Pharmacological properties of the anti-ulcer drug 3-[[[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]carbamoyl]methyl]-amino-N-methylbenz amide (DQ-2511, CAS 104775-36-2) on the central and autonomic nervous systems, smooth muscle, gastrointestinal system, and other miscellaneous systems were investigated. 1. DQ-2511 showed little or no influence on general behavior, spontaneous motor activity, hexobarbital sleeping time (mouse), conditioned avoidance response (rat), body temperature (rabbit), EEG or spinal reflex (cat) after oral administration (300-1000 mg/kg) or intravenous injection (15, 50 mg/kg). It also had no anticonvulsant or analgesic activities (mouse). 2. DQ-2511 had no influence on pupil size (rabbit). It reduced or tended to reduce contractile responses of the nictitating membrane induced by electrical stimulation of pre- and post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve (cat) at the highest dose. The drug inhibited the pressor response to norepinephrine, but had little or no inhibitory effect on the depressor response to acetylcholine at the highest dose (dog). 3. DQ-2511 reduced contractile responses to nicotine, BaCl2, acetylcholine, histamine and serotonin (isolated guinea pig ileum), to acetylcholine and histamine (trachea), and to norepinephrine (vas deferens) at high concentrations. It also inhibited spontaneous and oxytocin-induced motility (isolated rat uterus). 4. DQ-2511 decreased gastric motility in a dose-related manner at intravenous doses of 5-50 mg/kg (dog). It also reduced gastric emptying rate at oral doses of 100-1000 mg/kg, and gastric secretion at intraperitoneal doses of 100-300 mg/kg (rat). On the other hand, it induced no definite changes in intestinal motility (dog) or gastrointestinal transit (mouse). 5. DQ-2511 showed no activity on urine volume or urinary electrolyte excretion (rat), and no local anesthetic activity (guinea pig) even at the highest dose. It produced a slight potentiation of skeletal muscle contractile response to direct (muscle) and nerve stimulation (rabbit), with potentiation of the response to nerve stimulation being somewhat larger than that to muscle stimulation. DQ-2511 is considered to have no significant general pharmacological activities, except on the gastrointestinal system.

AB  - Potential processes through which nutritional and non-nutritional factors can relate to infant state and behavior and mother-infant interactions were examined in 41 mother-infant pairs from semirural Egyptian households. All infants were breast-fed, and breast milk was the main source of their nutrient intake. Median birth weight was close to reference median; however, most infants showed growth faltering when they were 3-6 mo of age. Among the infant behavioral and state variables, only drowsiness (a proxy for activity and alertness) was significantly associated with the nutritional and non- nutritional factors examined. Among these factors, mothers' intakes of animal source foods and certain B vitamins were the strongest predictors of drowsiness. The nature of the association between maternal diet and drowsiness, examined by multiple regression analysis, showed clearly that inadequate diet of the mother was the major risk factor. Alertness of infants was further compromised when there were several children in the households. The small, less vocal and less alert infants received less vocalization from their mothers. In this environment, infants of undernourished mothers may not receive the extra care and stimulation needed and are at risk for subsequent developmental disabilities.
Each week physicians visited the households of 41 mother-infant pairs living in Kalama, Egypt, to examine infant behavior and caregiver-infant interactions from 3 to 6 months of age, as they relate to various factors, e.g., maternal nutrition and health and socioeconomic status. All the mothers breast fed their infants. Liquids which are inferior sources of energy and nutrients were the most customary food supplements during the first 6 months. Even though the median birth weight tended to equal that of the WHO international reference, most infants experienced faltering growth by 3 months. At 6 months, 75% were below the 25th percentile and 20% were in the 5th percentile. Growth faltering was linked with increased diarrhea (p .05). Even though the mothers' diets contained sufficient niacin, thiamin, folate, and vitamin C, the diets did not supply mothers enough riboflavin, vitamin B-6, vitamin A, calcium, and zinc. Breast milk did not have adequate amounts of vitamin B-6 and, perhaps, not even enough riboflavin and vitamin A. It did contain adequate amounts of calcium, however. Drowsiness was significantly related to maternal diet during lactation but not during pregnancy (especially energy intake from animal sources, p = .0001; energy intake from plant sources, p = .03); number of siblings (p = .009); crowding (p = .06); vocalization from mothers (p = .08); and low socioeconomic status (p = .07). Maternal diet was the best predictor of drowsiness followed by number of siblings. Without remediation in maternal nutrition, infants of undernourished mothers appeared not to receive appropriate care and stimulation, therefore placing them at risk of subsequent development disabilities. Intervention studies should be done to examine this main effect of maternal undernutrition and the importance of covarying environmental risk factors, e.g., crowding.

AB  - Objective: Hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea is associated with disturbances of pulsatile gonadotrophin secretion. The underlying mechanism remains unclear and the aim of this study was to investigate the 24-hour secretory pattern of gonadotrophins in women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea. The effect of opioid blockade using naloxone infusion on LH secretory pattern was also studied. Design: The secretory patterns of LH, FSH, PRL and their responses to naloxone infusion were studied by serial blood samples collected at 10-minute intervals for 24 hours. On the following day, naloxone was infused at a dose of 1.6 mg per hour for 4 hours. Patients: Eight women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea, two women hyperprolactinaemic but with normal ovarian cycles, and nine control subjects in the early follicular phase of menstrual cycle. Measurements: Concentrations of LH, FSH and PRL were measured in plasma samples obtained at 10-minute intervals for 24 hours. In one woman, concentrations of urinary oestrone glucuronide were measured daily during treatment with pulsatile GnRH. Results: The number of LH pulses per 24 hours was significantly fewer in women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea than in those with hyperprolactinaemia with normal cycles or control subjects (mean ± SEM 4.5 ± 2.4 vs 13.5 ± 2.5 vs 17.3 ± 0.8, P < 0.001). The magnitude of each episode of secretion was significantly higher in the hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoeic women (P < 0.05) so the overall mean concentrations of LH throughout the 24-hour period was similar in the three groups (5.2 ± 1.1, 4.8 ± 0.8 and 5.2 ± 0.4 U/l respectively). In women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea there was no significant change in the pattern of LH secretion during sleep in contrast to the control women in whom there was a slowing in the LH pulse frequency during the night. There was no significant change in the mean concentrations of LH, FSH and PRL during the naloxone infusion. There were also no significant changes in the LH pulse frequency in response to naloxone infusion when compared with an equivalent period of time in the previous 24 hours. In one hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoeic woman, follicular development, ovulation and pregnancy were induced when gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) was infused in a pulsatile manner at a dose of 5 μg every 90 minutes. Conclusions: The suppression of normal ovarian cycles in women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea is due to a significant reduction in frequency of LH (GnRH) secretion which is not due to an increase in hypothalamic opioid activity. As normal ovarian cycles can occur or be induced by exogenous GnRH in hyperprolactinaemia, it is unlikely that a high level of prolactin by itself inhibits follicular development and ovulation.

AB  - To investigate the role of the retino-hypothalamic tract on fetal prolactin regulation, we examined the effect of ocular enucleation on fetal plasma prolactin. Eleven fetuses of Suffolk ewes were chronically catheterized during fall, and six of them were subjected to bilateral ocular enucleation. All ewes were kept at 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle (lights on at 0800 and off at 2000). The experiments were performed 5-9 days after surgery (GA control fetuses 125 ± 1.5, optical enucleation 121.3 ± 1.5 days). Blood samples were taken from fetuses hourly around the clock, and plasma prolactin and cortisol were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Luteinizing hormone (LH) and Growth hormone (GH) were measured in pooled plasma samples from control and enucleated fetuses by RIA. Average plasma prolactin was 5-fold lower in enucleated than in control fetuses (9.6 ± 0.5 and 54.2 ± 3.3 ng/ml, SEM; P < 0.005). Both control and enucleated fetuses presented circadian rhythm of prolactin with acrophase between 1400 and 1830 h. An enucleated fetus was tested for response of prolactin to TRH. Prolactin increased as described in the literature. There was no change in plasma concentration of cortisol, LH or GH after ocular enucleation. Our data indicate that the optical pathway participates in prolactin regulation in the fetal sheep.

AB  - In summary, although the basic mechanisms involved in the control of breathing during fetal and neonatal life are similar to those investigated more extensively in adult subjects, there are some aspects that make this control unique at this age. First, sleep seems to have a very profound effect during this period of life, particularly in the fetus, in which breathing is allowed to occur only during REM sleep. Second, in utero breathing activity is present since early gestation and without apparent reason, since it is not responsible for gas exchange. Being the lung of the fetus, the placenta is responsible for gas exchange. The purpose of fetal breathing must therefore be discovered. Third, the discovery of fetal breathing is probably the most exciting contribution made in this area during the last 50 years. To learn why this episodic breathing in utero becomes continuous after birth is the major challenge of the moment. Trying to understand this change at birth may result in the discovery of key mediators that are at the heart of the mechanism controlling breathing in general.

AB  - Recently, investigators have reported an alteration of postnatal respiratory pattern, deficient hypoxic arousal from sleep, and an increased incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) among human infants exposed to cocaine prenatally, thus suggesting that prenatal cocaine exposure may perturb the maturation of respiratory control thereby increasing the risk for SIDS. To investigate the effects of prenatal cocaine on postnatal respiration, we evaluated the ventilatory response to 0.21 F(I)O2 (baseline) and at 0.15, 0.10, and 0.08 F(I)O2 by the barometric method on days 4-5 of life in 23 New Zealand White rabbit pups born to cocaine-exposed (30 mg/kg/day of cocaine HCl by continuous subcutaneous infusion), pair-fed and free-fed does. The chamber pressure deflection (proportional to V(T) after appropriate calculation) was computer-sampled at 200 Hz when the unanesthetized pups were resting quietly with no gross body movements. Recording was made after 10 min acclimatization to a specific F(I)O2. We found that baseline ventilation did not differ significantly among study groups. However, minute ventilation (V̇(I)) inspiratory flow (V(T)/T(I)), tidal volume (V(T)) increased significantly with hypoxia to peak values at 0.08 F(I)O2 in pair-fed and free-fed pups but these measurements did not increase significantly in cocaine-exposed pups. Our finding of a deficient second phase of the hypoxic ventilatory response among cocaine-exposed pups supports the hypothesis that prenatal cocaine perturbs the maturation of respiratory control. It is likely that manipulation of dose, gestational timing, and route of prenatal cocaine exposure in an animal model will provide a useful tool to probe the maturation of control of breathing and potentially the pathogenic origin of SIDS.

AB  - The effect of cocaine on the behavioral state of six fetal sheep was studied during gestational ages between 128-135 days. Two to eight days after surgery, fetuses received either a continuous 60 min intravenous infusion of cocaine HCl (33.4 mg) or saline. The infusions were preceded and followed by control periods of 102 min. Cocaine induced a disruption in fetal behavioral state cyclicity and a decrease in the amount of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep (P < 0.01) and non-rapid eye movement sleep (P < 0.05) during the infusion, but not during the recovery period. Spectral amplitude of the electrocortical activity at all three cortical locations increased within most one-third octave bands between 0.8-4 Hz and decreased within most bands between 16-25 Hz (P < 0.05) compared to controls. There were no differences in spectral amplitude between pre- and post-cocaine periods at any location over the 25 frequency bands studied (P > 0.6) except for one frequency band centered at 12.5 Hz. The effects of a one hour cocaine infusion on fetal cortical electrical activity are diffuse, but short-lived, and occur independently of changes in fetal oxygenation. © 1992.

AB  - The neocortical ventricular zone is composed of a desynchronized population of proliferating cells. These cells give rise to neurons in the infragranular laminae of neocortex. The present study documents a diurnal rhythmicity of cell proliferation in the ventricular zone and examines the effects of ethanol on this biological clock. Pregnant rats were fed one of 3 diets. They were provided an ethanol-containing (6.7% v/v) liquid diet ad libitum between gestational day (G) 6 and G18, pair-fed an isocalorir liquid control diet, or fed chow and water. Throughout the experiments, the rats were fed either at 08.00 h (E.S.T.) or at 17.00 h (lights on 06.00 to 18.00 h). Rats were given a single injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on G17 at one point during a 24 h period (03.00, 06.00, 09.00 h, etc.). The fraction of ventricular cells that incorporated the BrdU was determined using quantitative immunohistochemical methods. Pair-fed control rats (fed at 08.00 or 17.00 h) consumed their food within 4 h of presentation. The ratio of cells passing through the S-phase of the cell cycle changed diurnally; the ratio was highest during the day (0.52 ± 0.01 at 12.00 h) and lowest during the night (0.40 ± 0.02 at 03.00 h). In contrast, the ethanol-fed rats grazed on their food throughout the dark cycle regardless of when the food was presented. The mean peak blood ethanol concentration was 142 ± 13 mg/dl during the dark phase and less than 25 mg/dl during the light phase. Prenatal exposure to ethanol eliminates the fetal circadian rhythm in cell proliferation (mean labeling index of 0.45 ± 0.03). This ethanol-induced alteration demonstrates the resiliency of the developing system; its ability to compensate for traumas that alter the epigenetic control of development. © 1992.

AB  - The existence of an activatable dopamine system within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the site of a biological clock, was investigated in rats during fetal life. In situ hybridization studies revealed that D1-dopamine receptor mRNA was highly expressed in the fetal SCN and not expressed in other hypothalamic regions. Cocaine injected into pregnant rats or directly into rat fetuses on day 20 of gestation selectively activated c-fos gene expression in the fetal SCN; cocaine did not induce c-fos expression elsewhere in the fetal brain or in the maternal SCN. This cocaine-induced activation of c-fos expression in fetal SCN was mediated in part through D1-dopamine receptors, as the cocaine-induced activation was partially blocked by the D1-dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390. In addition, the selective D1-dopamine receptor agonist SKF 38393 induced high levels of c-fos expression in the fetal SCN. The presence of an activatable dopamine system within the fetal SCN provides a mechanism through which maternal signals could entrain the fetal biological clock and through which maternally administered psychotropic drugs could alter normal development of the circadian timing system.

AB  - 1. This study examines the effect of chronic cold exposure during pregnancy, induced by winter shearing twin‐bearing ewes 4 weeks before predicted lambing date, on O2 consumption and CO2 production during non‐rapid‐eye‐movement (REM) sleep in lambs maintained for at least 1 h at warm (28‐18 degrees C) and cold (14‐5 degrees C) ambient temperatures at 1, 4, 14 and 30 days of age. This was combined with measurement of the thermogenic activity (GDP binding to uncoupling protein in mitochondrial preparations) of perirenal adipose tissue from lambs immediately after birth and at 33 days of age. 2. Lambs born from shorn (cold‐exposed) ewes were 15% heavier (P < 0.01) and possessed 21% (P < 0.01) more perirenal adipose tissue that contained 40% more protein and mitochondrial protein than unshorn (P < 0.05) controls. Total GDP binding in perirenal adipose tissue was 40% greater (P < 0.05) in lambs born from shorn ewes but there was no difference in lipid content of this tissue between the two groups. 3. At 1 day of age, lambs born from shorn ewes exhibited a 16% higher (P < 0.05) rate of O2 consumption (per kilogram bodyweight) at the warm temperature and a 40% greater metabolic response to the cold ambient temperature. All lambs born from shorn ewes responded to cold exposure without shivering (i.e. via non‐shivering thermogenesis) whilst shivering was measured in four out of seven lambs in the unshorn group. These differences had disappeared by 4 days of age as a result of a 25% increased (P < 0.01) rate of O2 consumption in the warm in lambs born from unshorn ewes and a 20% decrease (P < 0.05) in the response to the cold in lambs from shorn ewes. Shivering during cold exposure was measured in six out of nine lambs born from shorn ewes indicating a rapid alteration in thermoregulatory responses to cold during the first few days of life. 4. The levels of GDP binding and mitochondrial protein in perirenal adipose tissue fell by one‐third in both groups of lambs during the first 33 days of life whereas lipid content either increased or was unchanged. This indicated that brown adipose tissue (BAT) was developing the characteristics of white adipose tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) © 1992 The Physiological Society

AB  - Photoperiodic information is transferred from female Siberian hamsters to their fetuses during gestation. Although maternal melatonin is known to be essential for the transfer of prenatal photoperiodic information, its specific role is not well defined. The duration of the daily melatonin signal, expressed as an elevation of serum melatonin levels in the maternal circulation, has been hypothesized to convey day length information to the fetus. If this hypothesis is valid, it predicts that identical maternal melatonin signals should affect the fetuses identically, regardless of the prenatal photoperiod. To test this hypothesis, adult females received melatonin in beeswax or beeswax alone. They were paired with males and housed in photoperiods of 12L:12D or 16L:8D. On the day of parturition, mother and young were transferred to constant light (LL). Young males were killed on Day 28 of life, and weights of testes were determined. Prenatal treatment with beeswax alone did not affect the nature of the signal transferred from mother to fetus; young gestated in 12L:12D and reared in LL developed small testes, while those gestated in 16L:8D had large testes. On the other hand, the effect of the prenatal melatonin treatment on postnatal testicular development in LL was inversely dependent on the prenatal photoperiod: testicular growth was stimulated in young gestated in 12L:12D, but inhibited in young gestated in 16L:8D. To verify that the melatonin pellets produced equivalent serum melatonin levels in adult females in 12L:12D and 16L:8D, unmated adult females were killed 6-10 wk after receiving melatonin pellets. Serum levels were elevated in both groups throughout the day and night. These results demonstrate that factors in addition to maternal melatonin may contribute to the transmission of photoperiodic information to fetuses.

AB  - The effects of mating time and of LD cycles on the timing of birth and length of gestation were examined in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Hamsters maintained on 14L:10D cycles were mated for 2 h either in the evening or in the morning, and groups of hamsters mated in the morning were subjected to either a 6-h advance shift or a 6-h delay shift of the LD cycle on Days 5-14 of gestation. For the last 2 days of gestation the hamsters were kept in constant dim light and observed every hour to determine the time of birth. Hamsters mated in the evening gave birth an average of 4.8 h before those mated in the morning, and the hamsters subjected to an advance shift gave birth an average of 8.1 h before those subjected to delay shift. The results show that 80-100% of births occur during the subjective day on Day 16 of gestation and that the minimum duration of gestation is 15 days and 2 h. The regulation of birth appears to involve two processes, an interval timer related to the time of conception and a circadian rhythm that is governed by the LD cycle.

AB  - Two clearly distinct epochs of myometrial contractility were observed in 13 pregnant baboons when recorded either as intraamniotic pressure (IAP) or myometrial electromyogram (EMG). Contractures, epochs lasting longer than 3 min, were the characteristic form of myometrial activity throughout pregnancy. Contractures generated only small increases in IAP. Short-lived contractions, generating larger increases in IAP, were characteristic of labor and delivery. Power spectral analysis of IAP and myometrial EMG activity proved to be an effective means whereby periods when the myometrium was in the contractures or contractions mode could be easily distinguished. Concomitantly recorded maternal intraabdominal temperature showed significant 24-h variations. When myometrial activity switched from low-amplitude, long- lasting regular contractures of pregnancy to contractions, the switch always occurred around the onset of darkness. Five baboons went into spontaneous labor, 3 prematurely and 2 at term. In these animals the switch from contractures to contractions occurred for several nights before delivery. The recurrence and timing of the switch from contractures to contractions for several nights before delivery were similar to the pattern we and others have observed in the pregnant rhesus monkey. The presence of 24-h periodicity in the patterns of specific types of myometrial activity in another nonhuman primate lends support to the view that similar 24-h patterns of myometrial activity may occur in pregnant women.

AB  - Infants experiencing apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) have been reported to have elevated frequencies of periodic breathing and obstructive apnea when compared to presumably normal control groups. Whether these characteristics extend to the siblings of ALTE infants remains unknown. This study compared, retrospectively, the apnea indices of 13 first-born infants experiencing an ALTE with their subsequent asymptomatic siblings who had undergone polygraphic sleep apnea evaluations (including electrocardiogram, chest wall movements, expired CO2, and transcutaneous pulse oximetry). Gestation, birthweight, age at study, apnea and periodic breathing indices, and oxygen desaturations were compared. Regression analyses revealed that adjustments for gestational and postnatal age eliminated differences in apnea indices. ALTE infants and their subsequent siblings experienced similar rates of apnea. Neither group had elevated rates of prolonged central apneas (greater than 10 seconds duration) or periodic breathing (greater than 5% sleep time). Neither group had subsequent severe apneas. The use of polygraphic study and cardiac/apnea monitors in subsequent siblings of ALTE are unnecessary and should be considered only when there is parental disagreement.

AB  - The 24-h activity patterns of variouns enzymes were determined in human serum, red blood cells and white blood cells of maternal and umbilical cord blood. Blood was drawn from the brachial vein of mothers and from the umbilical cord within ten minutes after delivery. Corresponding blood specimens were obtained from 83 spontaneous labors, occurring at different hours over a period of 60 days. For each variable (variable=activity of a specific enzyme in one of the blood components) the results were grouped according to delivery hour, forming a 24-h pattern which was analyzed to elucidate time dependency. Five out of six corresponding maternal and fetal variables were similar with regard to pattern and peak time. The activity rhythms of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glucose phosphate isomerase in red blood cells of mothers and fetuses possessed a significant bimodal pattern. The activity rhythms of the latter enzyme in white blood cells and sera exhibited a significant 24-h period. Hexosaminidase activity exhibited a distinct 24-h rhythm in maternal white blood cells, but no significant rhythm could be detected in the fetal white blood cells. The activity of hexosaminidase showed, identical 24-h patterns in maternal and cord serum when analyzed by best fit cosine, and no significant time-dependency when analyzed by ANOVA. © 1992 Birkhäuser Verlag Basel.

AB  - This case-controlled study examines some recently implicated risk factors for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (S.I.D.S.) in Irish infants. Irish S.I.D.S. infants are lighter at birth than controls (3463g) compared to (3542g) and boys out-number girls by a ratio of 1.3:1. S.I.D.S. infants are more frequently: breast-fed (42% vs 25%) and sleep in a location other than the parent's bedroom (54% vs 21%), but start solids at a similar age and appear not to be sicker prior to death than the control group. This study highlights the frequency of symptoms of possible ill-health (i.e. snuffles and being"chesty") in well infants during the first months of life with 32% of the control group having snuffles and 35% described as "chesty". In addition these symptoms are frequently treated with antibiotics with 31% of the control group having already received antibiotics by 2 months of age. A majority of S J.D.S. infants were described as cold when found (52%) with 39% described as warm and 15% as sweaty. Obviously the recently implicated role of overheating may be relevant in the latter 15% of S.I.D.S. cases. In this series, 88% of infants had died by 6 months of age. Of the 97 parents of S.I.D.S infants questioned, 78 had subsequently become pregnant by the time the study was conducted at an average time of 5 months post the S.I.D.S event. © 1992 Springer.

AB  - Eighteen non-pregnant woman complaining about insomnia were polysomnographically investigated for 3 nights with weekly intervals. They received placebo, 2 mg flunitrazepam or 10 mg zolpidem according to a cross-over double blind design. The patients were selected by general practitioners on the basis of subjective complaints. Zolpidem is a recently introduced short-acting imidazopyridine hypnotic, binding to a subunit of the benzodiazepine 1 receptor. Flunitrazepam is a well-known hypnotic, binding to both the benzodiazepine 1 and 2 receptor subtypes. Objective recording did not substantiate the subjective complaint of insomnia. Sleep patterns during placebo differed only little from that expected from age matched healthy persons. Both flunitrazepam and zolpidem significantly shortened sleep onset (5 min of continuous sleep beginning with NREM 1 sleep). The sleep composition following flunitrazepam was characterized by an increase in NREM 2, a prolongation of the time to REM sleep, a reduction of REM sleep and an increase in NREM 3-4 sleep during the first 2 h of sleep. The sleep composition following zolpidem resembled more that seen in persons without sleep complaints. However, as compared to placebo, there was a decrease of the time spent awake during sleep and an increase in NREM 3-4 during the first 2 of sleep. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The behaviour of fetuses in utero is often described using terms that were originally devised to describe behaviour after birth. This article considers a definition of the states of coma, sleep, and wakefulness, using criteria that might equally be applied before and after birth. Current knowledge of behaviour of the sheep and human fetus is discussed in the light of such criteria. It is concluded that these species do not appear to be comatose in utero. At present there is insufficient evidence to conclude that sleep and wakefulness exist in utero. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nonnutritive sucking has been found to affect movement, sleep, state regulation and arousal, oxygenation, and nutrition and growth. Its quality is used as an indicator of central nervous system well-being. Speculations have been suggested about improved outcomes from respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The possible effect of sucking movements on attachment between mother and infant has also been described. Further research in the many areas in which this sucking phenomenon has effects are indicated. Exploration of the impact of nonnutritive sucking on the preterm infant of less than 28 weeks gestation and less than 800 gm and on the infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia is recommended. Further research also needs to focus on implications of clinical applications of these findings to nursing care.

Based on perinatal animal studies and data from human foetuses and/or preterm infants it was concluded that human circadian rhythms are present as early as at 30 weeks of gestation. The significance of the mother and/or the environment regarding the entrainment of the "endogenous" foetal biological clock was emphasized. © 1992 Pergamon Press Ltd.

AB  - The circadian rhythm of α-amylase, E.C. 3.2.1.1. (α-1,4-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase) in the parotid glands of 25-day-old rats were studied under different experimental designs (fasting, reversed photoperiod, constant lighting conditions and treatment with reserpine and α-methyl-p-tyrosine). The rhythm of fasted rats did not change. There were modifications in the rhythm of rats submitted to a reversed photoperiod or treated with reserpine or α-methyl-p-tyrosine. The rhythm was present, with changes in the acrophase, in parotids of rats kept during their gestation and postnatal life in constant light or dark. Results suggest that the circadian rhythm of α-amylase in parotid gland of young rats is endogenous, synchronized by the photoperiod, and with maternal coordination. © 1992.

AB  - The circadian changes in serum estriol concentration in the case of gestosis (at 30-36 weeks gestation) and intra-uterine growth retardation-IUGR (at 28-36 weeks) were examined. The control group consisted of pregnant patients without placental insufficiency at 26-34 weeks gestation. No circadian rhythms of estriol secretion was found in patients with gestosis and IUGR, whereas such a rhythm was confirmed in normal pregnancies. The evaluation of circadian changes in estriol concentration in the third trimester of gestation may be useful when diagnosing chronic placenta insufficiency.

AB  - The studies have demonstrated a correcting and synchronizing effect of differentiated psychotherapy and dosed exercise on the maternal and fetal reactions to active postural load in women with gestational arterial hypotension, developing a blood circulatory disadaptation in the mother-fetus system and circadian desynchronization of the postural tone. Traditional physiopsychoprophylactic preparation to labor, carried out in the reference group of pregnant women, was of no avail in this respect.

AB  - A radioimmunoassay for the determination of progesterone in saliva using a 125J-labelled progesterone derivate has been developed. The assay is characterized by the excellent sensitivity of 3.12 pg progesterone/ml. During the menstruel cycle of normal women the biphasic rhythm of progesterone in saliva could not been clearly demonstrated. In the follicle phase high peaks of progesterone have been shown and even in the luteal phase individual low values have been observed. The circadian rhythms of progesterone in saliva are characterized by irregular oscillations. The saliva flow rate is not responsible for the progesterone concentration. The measurement of progesterone in serum seems to be more useful in the diagnosis of sterility.

Of these, one was a 26 year old female who had progressive dystonia of more than 20 years' duration with classical diurnal fluctuations exacerbated by exercise and relieved with sleep; she also had significant worsening during menstruation and the later half of her pregnancy, resulting in a stillbirth. She responded remarkably to low doses of L-dopa.

AB  - This prospective study of 63 women was designed to investigate the relationship between sleep disruption prior to the birth, during labour and in the early postpartum period and the subsequent development of the postnatal blues. The results from this preliminary study suggest that two factors: (a) a night-time labour; and (b) a history of sleep disruption in the latter stages of pregnancy, may have aetiological importance in the development of postnatal blues. There was little evidence from this study to suggest that sleep disruption on the nights following the birth, the third sleep factor investigated, had any impact on the expression of the blues. © 1992.

AB  - Nine pregnant rhesus monkeys maintained in constant low level lighting (5 Lux) from 56-80 days gestation (dGA) onward were studied to assess the presence or absence of circadian maternal body temperature and maternal plasma hormone variations. Maternal arterial blood samples were taken every 4 h in six monkeys (105-120 dGA) for 48-56 h and every 2 h in three monkeys (108-115 dGA) for 60 h. Maternal intraabdominal temperature was recorded continuously. Cosinor analysis was used to determine circadian rhythmicity. Individual endogenous timekeeping was demonstrated by 1) free-running circadian variations in maternal body temperature in all nine animals, 2) consistent internal acrophase relationships between the maternal body temperature and maternal plasma cortisol rhythm, and 3) idiosyncrasy of the temporal relationship of detectable rhythms to the external environment in individual animals. Only one animal had a significant maternal plasma ACTH rhythm, whereas the presence of 24-h variations in the other hormones varied in individual animals. The mean ± SD acrophase profiles in hours from the temperature acrophase in those animals who showed significant rhythms were 19.7 ± 0.6 (n = 8) for cortisol, 19.4 ± 2.4 (n = 6) for dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, 8.3 + 1.1 (n = 6) for progesterone, and 18.9 ± 1.6 (n = 3) for estradiol. We conclude that 24-h variations in maternal plasma hormones are truly endogenously generated and not passively dependent on the light-dark cycle. The maternal circadian system regulates the 24 h temporal organization of endogenous plasma hormone variations. We hypothesize that rhythms in cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, progesterone, and estradiol during pregnancy are directly or indirectly governed by the maternal hypothalamus via the circadian oscillatory output of the maternal adrenal. © 1992 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Twenty-four-hour energy expenditure (EE), daily and sleeping EE, and the energy cost of a standardized treadmill exercise were assessed in a respiration chamber in 41 young pregnant Gambian women at 12 (n = 11), 24 (n = 15), and 36 (n = 15) wk of gestation and compared with 13 nonpregnant nonlactating (NPNL) control women. The rate of 24-h EE was significantly higher (P < 0.001) at 36 wk gestation (8443 ± 243 kJ/d) than in the NPNL group (6971 ± 172 kJ/d) or at 12 and 24 wk (7088 ± 222 and 7188 ± 192 kJ/d, respectively). Per unit body weight, no more differences in 24-h EE, daily and sleeping EE, or energy cost of walking were observed between pregnant and NPNL women. There was no statistical difference in the 24-h respiratory quotient among the groups. We conclude that the state of pregnancy in Gambian women induces a progressive rise in 24-h EE, which becomes significant in the third trimester and is proportional to body weight.

AB  - Plasma concentrations of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) in healthy control persons do not change significantly during adult lifetime and no diurnal changes could be detected. In addition, no alterations of plasma EGF concentrations occur during acute and chronic stress and in all three trimesters of pregnancy. Thus, the previously suggested theories that EGF might play a causative role in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis during the stress reaction and in the prevention of peptic ulcers in pregnancy could not be confirmed by the present data.

AB  - Thirty female subjects examined in the first three months of pregnancy took part in the study. Ten of these suffered from severe gravidic hyperemesis, while twenty had a physiological pregnancy. All subjects with hyperemesis and six controls were subjected to measurement of cortisolaemia at the following times: 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 4.00 so as to obtain the circadian curve of the hormone, measurement of T3 and T4 and of TSH. The Cattell test in form C was carried out in all patients. The results obtained evidenced a global increase in the production of cortisol in the group of hyperemetic women, with maintenance of the circadian rhythm. The Cattell test identified characteristic personality traits in the subjects suffering from hyperemesis compared to the controls.

AB  - Background: Postpartum psychotic disorders are rare and poorly understood phenomena occurring after approximately 1 in 2000 births. Increasing attention has been given to the concept of postpartum psychosis as an affective spectrum disorder. We sought to characterize the responses to sleep deprivation of three women with postpartum psychotic and mood symptoms. Method: Three hospitalized postpartum women with no prior history of psychotic disorder were treated according to a partial sleep deprivation protocol. Each patient was awakened at 2:00 a.m. and kept awake until 9:00 p.m. the following night. A full and an abbreviated Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) were completed for each patient before and after partial sleep deprivation. Results: Two of the three patients became transiently manic and the third became hypomanic after sleep deprivation. HAM-D scores decreased drastically for each patient. After recovery sleep, each patient de-escalated but required further treatment with mood-stabilizing agents. Conclusion: These findings suggest that postpartum psychosis in our patients may represent a variant of bipolar affective disorder.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to determine whether plasma oxytocin concentrations show a daily rhythm. STUDY DESIGN: Ten women between 37 and 39 weeks of gestation volunteered for the study. They were admitted 1 to 2 days before the experiment. Three blood samples were taken with 2-minute intervals each time, at 8 AM, 4 PM, and 12 midnight. Oxytocin, 17 β-estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol were measured by radioimmunoassay with highly specific antibodies. Statistical analysis of variance by Friedman's test was followed by multiple range testing, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Significant daily rhythm was found for plasma cortisol, progesterone, and oxytocin and for the estradiol/progesterone ratio. Oxytocin showed a nocturnal peak and a strong negative correlation with the estradiol/progesterone ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The daily rhythm in plasma oxytocin parallels the rhythm in uterine activity (shown by others), suggesting a causal relationship between the two. Both may in turn be related to the ratio of circulating estradiol and progesterone. © 1992.

AB  - First-time parent couples from childbirth classes were randomly assigned to a four-session training group n = 29 or a control group n = 31. Members of the training group were taught behavioral strategies to promote healthy, self-sufficient sleep patterns in their infants, whereas the control group received the same amount of personal contact without the behavioral training. Six sleep variables were derived from a daily infant sleep diary completed by parents at two time points. Results show that at age 6-9 weeks, infants in the training group displayed significantly better sleeping patterns than did control infants. Training group parents awakened and responded less often to infant signaling and reported greater parental competence. By contrast, control group parents indicated increased stress over time.

AB  - Colic is periodic behavior occurring at the end of the day during the first 3 months of life characterized by crying. It is hypothesized that the crying at the end of the day is due to sleep inertia or a state dissociation during which the infant is simultaneously partially awake and partially asleep because of the absence of a melatonin diurnal rhythm. The melatonin timing mechanism, which codes for day length, is initiated prenatally by the maternal pineal gland, and after 3 months postnatally, the melatonin nocturnal secretion rhythm is maintained by the infant's pineal gland. To record the seasonal variation in day length away from the equator, 12 months are required to complete the melatonin chemical calendar. This circannual process is only 9 months completed at the time of birth, and 3 additional months are needed during which the infant may have difficulty reconciling cues for the timing of evening sleep due to discrepancies between the expected photoperiod derived from the prenatal maternal pineal melatonin circadian rhythm and the postnatally experienced photoperiod. Data is presented showing that the incidence of colic increases with increasing latitude in support of the hypothesis that infant crying at the end of the day during the first 3 months represents the last quarter of a circannual photoperiodic development process. © 1992.

AB  - An alteration upon the daily rhythm of blood pressure in patients with gestational hypertension has been reported, albeit inconsistently. Hence we have evaluated the daily rhythm of blood pressure in women with normal gestation (n = 100) and with pregnancy associated hypertension (n = 111). In an attempt to delineate a possible etiology of the hypertension, patients were subdivided according to a classification of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. (Group I. Preeclampsia-eclampsia; group II. Chronic hypertension; group III. Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia; group IV. Late gestational hypertension). Blood pressure quantitation was made with sphygmomanometer and by different observes. Those with normal pregnancy showed a higher increase in both systolic and diastolic pressure in the morning with a peak at 1200 H, that contrasted with a very low level registered at 2400 H. Altogether the hypertensive group exhibited a loss of rhythm; whereas by group: in I. There was absence of rhythm without a predominant pattern; II. & III. An increase of systolic pressure which was accetuated at 0600 H. group IV. Showed the lowest tensional levels without special characteristics. Through these data, it seems that the central nervous system loses control upon daily regulation of blood pressure in preeclamptic women.

AB  - Most wild and captive nonhuman primates give birth nocturnally. Circadian rhythm mechanisms are a principal determinant of the nonrandom initiation of labor, but it has been suggested that the decreased human activity and increased seclusion over the weekend in laboratory primate colonies may result in an effect whereby births are confined mainly to the quiet periods. This study tests for such an effect in the timing of 153 live, term births in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) housed in three institutions with various management practices. Eighty‐four percent of births occurred nocturnally, and peak delivery time was between 2400 and 0700 hours. When the total number of births was examined, significantly fewer births occurred on Wednesdays and Thursdays, during the mid‐week peak in colony activity, and significantly more births occurred on Sundays and Mondays. In facilities having marked alterations between weekday and weekend activity, significantly more births occurred Sunday and Monday. In the colonies where weekend and weekday surveillance and activity were similar, births were more evenly distributed throughout the week. These data suggest that parturition may be inhibited by routine colony activities that are perceived as stressful by some animals, and that the decreased activity and increased privacy on weekends may allow relaxation of parturient females, resulting in delivery during or immediately following the weekend. Colony managers should minimize colony activities that are potentially stressful to prepartal females in order to reduce risks to the fetus that may occur with delay or disruption of normal parturition. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine if dexamethasone alters myometrial responsiveness to oxytocin or oxytocin secretion. STUDY DESIGN: Studies were conducted in rhesus macaques (n = 6), between 144 and 148 days' gestation (term 167 days). The first study was conducted at 9 am and repeated 36 hours later at 9 pm. At 9 am the following morning a continuous maternal dexamethasone infusion (15 μg/kg/hr given intravenously) was initiated, and the study was repeated at 9 PM, 60 hours later. Four doses of oxytocin (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 pg/kg/min) were administered as 1-minute pulses every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. The number of contractions per pulse (contraction/pulse ratio) was used to determine differences in myometrial responsiveness. RESULTS: Before dexamethasone infusion there was a circadian rhythm in uterine activity with peak contractile events between 8 and 10 pm (p < 0.01), whereas during infusion the rhythm was ablated. At oxytocin dose 1, the 9 am contraction/pulse ratio (0.3 ± 0.1) was flower than that for 9 pm (0.6 ± 0.2) and for 60 hours later (0.6 ± 0.1) (mean ± SE, p < 0.05). Similar results were observed at dose 2, whereas no differences in the contraction/pulse ratio were noted at dose 3. Basal plasma oxytocin concentrations were unaffected by dexamethasone treatment, whereas plasma estradiol and cortisol concentrations were reduced compared with control values (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: (1) There is a differential sensitivity to oxytocin between morning and evening and (2) the dexamethasone-induced loss of the uterine contractile rhythm is not the result of a loss of myometrial sensitivity to oxytocin or to a suppression of plasma oxytocin concentrations. © 1992.

AB  - Despite numerous attempts in describing the many underlying events correlated with changes in behavioral states, the biological significance of state alternation remains unknown. There does not yet exist a satisfactory explanation for the biological need for such state changes, nor does there exist sufficient physiological evidence to explain the underlying processes leading to these state transitions. Nonetheless, the study of the ontogeny of behavioral states is important because it shows the progressive ability of the organism to integrate multiple neuronal systems. Available literature suggests that some rudimentary form of behavioral state is established in fetal life throughout the animal kingdom, although there is substantial difference in the degree and rate of development of organized behavioral states among the different animal species. Highly organized behavioral states that involve concurrence of many physiologic systems are present in the third trimester in the fetal lamb, while they are not seen until 2 to 3 weeks postnatally in the rat, rabbit, and cat. Subsequent maturation consists primarily of increased cycle length in all species. In addition, there is some evidence that a circadian rhythm may be superimposed on the ultradian rhythm of behavioral states in immature animals, but there is currently no information on the ontogenesis of this circadian rhythm. It is currently hypothesized that behavioral states cycling in the adult is generated by the interaction of multiple, anatomically distributed sets of neurons. 40 Electrophysiological and pharmacological studies have suggested that both the cholinergic and aminergic neuronal systems play important roles in the maintenance of state cycling. Studies in the fetal lamb also support these proposed mechanisms in early development. 41, 42 However, there is little evidence to indicate that changes in transmitter release or receptor sensitivity occur in the course of sleep deprivation in the adult. A number of other neuropeptides may also be involved in this complicated control system. The progressive organization of behavioral states in early development and the agerelated changes in cycle duration may provide valuable insight in understanding the neurobiological events that underlie state alternation and homeostasis. © 1992.

AB  - The interpretation of previous data on osteocalcin during pregnancy has been complicated by the fact that serum levels, at least in nonpregnant women, display a significant circadian variation. In the present study, serum concentrations of osteocalcin were recorded for 24 h in 12 individual women. In 4 nonpregnant women, there were striking diurnal fluctuations during the sampling period, with values ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 ng/ml. One woman who was investigated in the 11 th week of pregnancy showed similar fluctuations in osteocalcin concentrations whereas in the 15th and 17th week values were much lower with minor fluctuations. In 4 women investigated during late pregnancy (weeks 34-38), osteocalcin serum levels were extremely low (range 0.2-0.4 ng/ml), often below the detection limit of the assay, and there was no diurnal variation. Also, in 1 lactating woman, osteocalcin serum levels were low (0.3-0.8 ng/ml) and stable. Low osteocalcin values during pregnancy may indicate a reduced bone turnover possibly mediated via an altered estrogen and growth hormone secretion. © 1992 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Abstract: Female rats exposed to long (LD 18:6) or short (LD 6:18) photoperiods from 21 days of age were mated when they reached 55 days of age. On day 2 of gestation animals of each group were either pinealectomized or sham‐operated. Lighting regimens were not changed during the course of the study. Male offspring of the four groups of dams were sacrificed on day 70 after birth. Rats that were maintained on long photoperiod had higher testicular testosterone, androstenedione, and dihydrotestosterone content than those raised on a LD 6:18 cycle. Whatever the breeding photoperiod used, maternal pinealectomy induced no modification of reproductive function. Among rats kept in short photoperiod, neonatal pinealectomy (on day 5 after birth) resulted in an enhanced testicular androgen content without any modification of plasma androgen concentration. These results indicate that (1) the previously reported effect of the mother's pineal on pubertal rat testicular function is not present in adulthood and (2) the pineal of the offspring is required to maintain normal testicular androgen content in the adult rat but exerts no influence on circulating androgens.

AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that changes in photoperiod alter plasma catecholamine concentrations in the rhesus monkey during late gestation. Twelve chronically catheterized pregnant rhesus macaques were acclimated to a 12-h photoperiod (lights-on, 0700-1900 h). Under the control L:D cycle, blood samples were collected at 3-h intervals over 24 h for catecholamine analysis. Plasma concentrations (mean ± SEM, pg/ml) ranged from 678 ± 90 to 928 ± 142 for norepinephrine; 230 ± 22 to 631 ± 141 for epinephrine; and 282 ± 70 to 1090 ± 362 for dopamine. A diurnal rhythm was observed in epinephrine with peak concentrations during lights-on (0900-1800 h; p < 0.05, compared to lights-off). After the first sampling protocol, the animals were divided equally between two groups: phase shift, in which lights-on was shifted 11 h (2000-0800 h) and constant light, with lights on continuously. After the phase shift, a parallel shift in the plasma epinephrine rhythm was noted, with peak levels observed between 2200 and 0700 h (p < 0.05). Constant light abolished the rhythm in epinephrine, with an overall reduction in mean basal levels of all three catecholamines. Daily melatonin infusions (0.2 μg/kg/h, 1900-0630 h) under constant light failed to restore the epinephrine rhythm or to return basal catecholamine concentrations to control photoperiod levels. These data suggest that photoperiod entrains the rhythm in epinephrine secretion, but the rhythm is ablated under constant conditions. Further, melatonin does not appear to play a role in the regulation of catecholamine secretion in the pregnant rhesus macaque.

AB  - Objective: Our objective was to determine the normal sequence of neurobehavioral development in the human fetus between 14 weeks' gestation and delivery. Study Design: The study was performed by longitudinal ultrasonographic observation of 45 low-risk singleton fetuses. Results: During the first half of the midtrimester there was a high rate of spontaneous movement that appeared randomly distributed. By the end of that trimester an increase in the duration of intervals of quiescence resulted in activity appearing cyclically distributed, with the duration of quiet cycles progressively increasing to term. Fetal mouthing and breathing were linked with cyclic behavior from the time of their emergence. Fetal heart rate pattern A could be recognized from around 32 weeks, due to a reduction in baseline variability in quiet cycles after 30 weeks, whereas pattern B could be recognized several weeks earlier. From the time cyclic behavior and heart rate patterns could be recognized, intervals of coincidence of the fetal behavioral state variables increased progressively with advancing gestation. © 1992, Mosby.

AB  - Objective To determine the variability of protein excretion in patients with proteinuric hypertension and the accuracy of either a urinary protein/creatinine ratio or a Multistix examination for the estimation of a 24 h protein excretion. Design An indwelling urinary catheter was placed for 24 h and successive 8 h specimens examined. Setting A tertiary referral hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Subjects 22 women with significant proteinuria in pregnancy were studied. Main outcome measures The urine volume, protein excretion and creatinine excretion in eight hourly periods were measured. Multistix examination of each specimen was recorded. Results A large coefficient of variation in urine volume (41%), amount of protein excreted (44%) and the amount of creatinine excreted (22%) in the eight hourly specimens were noted. The protein creatinine ratio did not accurately predict the 24 h protein excretion. The Multistix examination was less accurate with increasing amounts of proteinuria. The amount of creatinine excreted correlated with the volume of urine passed (r = 0.43). Conclusion The analysis of a 24 h specimen or urine for protein excretion remains the best method of monitoring proteinuria in pregnancy. The amount of creatinine excreted in 24 h cannot be used as an index of completeness of collection of the 24 h specimen. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - As is proved by nuclear disaster in Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), iodine prophylaxis may be respected as one of the most urgent and effective methods of prevention of radiation injury of the thyroid gland in the population affected. Author has studied factors and methods of its efficacy and reliability. On the basis of experiments in rats, analytical ways of determination of the dietary iodine intake (iodine supply) of people living around NPP Paks (Hungary) as well as compartment modelling, experiments it is shown, that for optimisation of iodine prophylaxis in masses it is very important to increase the iodine supply up to the recommended values. Combined use of decreased doses of potassium iodide and perchlorate was found to be the optimal way for removal of radioiodine from pregnant organisms and their offsprings following accidental intake of radioiodine.

AB  - The antiepileptic drug valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid; [VPA]) is teratogenic in humans and a number of animal species. Using a murine model, we studied the mechanism of VPA-induced teratogenesis during a period of organogenesis sensitive to interference with closure of the neural tube (days 8 to 9). Teratogenic doses of valproic acid altered the pattern of folate metabolites in the embryo: Levels of 5-formyl- and 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolates decreased, and the level of tetrahydrofolate increased. These changes could be explained by VPA-mediated inhibition of transfer of the formyl group via glutamate formyltransferase. Neural-tube defects, alteration of embryonic folate metabolism, and inhibition of the specific enzyme are all produced by comparable doses and levels of the drug. A closely related structural analog of VPA (2-en-VPA, 2-propyl-2-pentenoic acid), which exhibits antiepileptic activity but not teratogenicity, did not influence the embryonic folate metabolism. Our results suggest that interference with embryonic folate metabolism might be an important aspect of the induction of neural-tube defects by VPA. The novel techniques described also should prove useful in studying the teratogenic mechanisms of other drugs. © 1992 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Aim: To show the extent of diurnal variations in serum urate concentration and the possible consequences on the clinical interpretation. Mehtods: Nineteen controls and 40 patients took part in this study. Preliminary investigations on selected subjects provided blood samples at regular intervals between the hours of 0800 and 2300 hours. From these observations the timing of venepuncture for the remaining subjects was chosen at 0800-0900 hours, with a second sample taken between 1700 and 1800 hours. Analytical quality was monitored using quality control procedures and all samples were analysed in a single batch to minimise errors. Results: All subjects, except some hypertensive elderly women, showed a diurnal rhythm. The mean serum urate value between 0800-0900 hours was higher than that observed between 1700-1800 hours. A decrease of up to 30% was observed in a group of diabetic patients. Nine subjects in the study had hyperuricaemia in the morning, but only six in the afternoon, indicating the requirement of a reference interval that takes account of diurnal variations. Conclusion: When studying the temporal relation for the medial importance, or when attempting to interpret the serum urate concentration, it is important to consider the diurnal rhythms of this analyte.

AB  - Considers significant discoveries concerning the host-seeking behaviour of adult tsetse Glossina (both sexes being obligate blood feeders), with emphasis on their implementation in improving the efficacy of baits. Following an outline of tsetse fly biology and their role as vectors, together with comments on the development of baits, major sections examine: 1) Host location, which is affected by both endogenous factors (eg a circadian rhythm of activity, level of starvation, and age, sex and pregnancy status) and exogenous ones (eg temperature, vapour pressure deficit, and visual, mechanical and olfactory host stimuli), it being the latter set of factors that is usually manipulated, particularly olfaction and vision, through bait design. 2) Theoretical models and tsetse control, largely based on the relatively slow reproductive rate of tsetse with predictions of the percentage daily mortality levels required to eradicate populations. 3) Traps and targets currently in use and potential future developments. Despite considerable efforts at their eradication over the last century, tsetse fly distribution over c40% of tropical Africa has remained farly constant, and suppression rather than eradication may be a more realistic goal. -P.J.Jarvis

AB  - To determine whether β2-adrenergic stimulant (clenbuterol) would exhibit beneficial effects upon the elimination of night-time calving, 42 Holstein Friesian cows and heifers at the first stage of labour were injected intramuscularly twice with clenbuterol; 300 μg at 18:00 and 210 μg at 22:00. Other 26 cows and heifers of the same breed at the first stage of labour at 18:00 were not treated and served as controls. All of the treated animals, but one, calved after 5:00 in the next morning, showing a peak of parturition between 5:00 and 10:00. In contrast to this, 42% of the control animals calved at night between 22:00 and 5:00. Thus, the double administrations of clenbuterol were shown to be effective for eliminating night-time calving. The cows treated with clenbuterol tended to show lower incidences of dystocia and retained placenta and a higher first insemination conception rate than the control animals. No adverse effects of the treatment on the viability of newborn calves and milk yields were observed. © 1992, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF VETERINARY SCIENCE. All rights reserved.

AB  - To study the relationship between estrous and circadian periodicity, we investigated the period of the estrous cycle in two types of female golden hamsters: normals (circadian period ∼ 24 h) and itτ mutants (circadian period ∼ 20 h). Records of running wheel activity, general locomotor activity, body temperature, vaginal secretion, and sexual receptivity of hamsters kept under constant lighting conditions indicated an estrous period of approximately 96 h for both groups of animals. The fact that animals with different circadian periods have the same estrous period suggests the existence of separate mechanisms in the control of circadian and estrous periodicity. Circadian periodicity is determined by a pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, whereas estrous periodicity is determined by positive and negative feedback loops involving the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads. Coupling of the two mechanisms takes place under at least some conditions, but additional research is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms by which this is accomplished. © 1978 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - The placenta secretes large amounts of the hypothalamic releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), into both the maternal and fetal circulation during pregnancy. We characterized the relationship between maternal plasma CRH and products of the pituitary and adrenal in order to investigate the physiologic role of placental CRH in modulating maternal pituitary-adrenal function. Plasma was obtained from 8 women at biweekly intervals between 21 and 40 weeks of full-term pregnancy for CRH, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α MSH), cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) measurements by radioimmunoassay. Eighteen women were also studied once at 22-34 weeks of pregnancy with plasma CRH and 24-hour urinary free cortisol measurement. Eight nonpregnant women served as control subjects. Plasma CRH was undetectable in the nonpregnant subjects and rose over the time period studied in the pregnant women. Concentrations of afternoon ACTH and cortisol also rose during pregnancy while DHEAS levels declined in the pregnant women. The a-MSH levels were beneath the level of detection (< 20 pg/ml) in both the pregnant and nonpregnant subjects. The overall mean afternoon ACTH concentration was higher in the pregnant than in the nonpregnant women (11.4 ± 1.8 vs. 5.9 ± 1.8 pg/ml; p < 0.05), although the ACTH levels in both groups remained within the normal range. The mean plasma cortisol concentrations were higher in the pregnant women, while the mean DHEAS levels were lower in the pregnant women when compared to the nonpregnant subjects. The urinary free cortisol concentration was also significantly higher in the pregnant than in the nonpregnant women (89.2 ± 14.5 vs. 29 ± 1 µg/day; p < 0.05). The maternal plasma CRH concentration was significantly correlated with the 24-hour urinary free cortisol level (r = 0.71; p < 0.001). Thus we show that maternal plasma CRH, ACTH, cortisol, and urinary free cortisol rise during pregnancy, while plasma DHEAS declines. The present data strongly support the hypothesis that placental CRH is a physiologic regulator of the pituitary-adrenal axis and that these alterations of pituitaty-adre- nal function during pregnancy may be due in part to chronic placental CRH secretion. © 1992 S.

AB  - The clinical implications of diminished circadian blood pressure variations during hypertensive pregnancies are not fully understood. We used the COSINOR-method to quantify circadian blood pressure amplitudes of 32 patients with preeclampsia (GG) and 21 patients with superimposed pre-eclampsia (PG). The two groups did not significantly differ in body weight, age, and gestational date at admission. No differences could be detected in 24-h blood pressure values between the two groups (GG: 127 ± 14/82 ± 12 mmHg; PG: 128 ± 16/86 ± 9 mmHg). Circadian amplitudes of systolic blood pressure variations (GG: 5.9 ± 5.5 mmHg, PG: 4.5 ± 6.9 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure variations (GG: 3.8 ± 3.0 mmHg, PG: 5.3 ± 4.1 mmHg) did not differ significantly. The slope between successive changes of mean arterial blood pressure and successive changes in heart rate was significantly higher in patients with superimposed pre-eclampsia (GG: 0.16 ± 0.27 mmHg/bpm, PG: 0.36 ± 0.24 mmHg/bpm, p < 0.005). We conclude that patients with pre-eclampsia and superimposed pre-eclampsia do not differ in 24-h blood pressure and circadian blood pressure variability, however, if blood-pressure variability is related to heart-rate variability differences become apparent that might be due to altered blood-pressure regulation.

AB  - Serum copper and zinc concentrations (μmol/L) were measured in nonfasting subjects aged 25-64 y participating in two independent population surveys in Northern Ireland. In 1983-84, copper in 1144 males was 17.2 ± 3.1 (x̄ ± SD) and zinc was 12.1 ± 1.7 (SD). Copper in 1055 females, neither pregnant nor taking estrogens or progestogens, was 19.0 ± 3.9 and zinc was 11.6 ± 1.4. In 1986-87 copper in 1142 males was 17.9 ± 3.3 and zinc was 13.2 ± 2.1. Copper in 1034 females was 20.1 ± 3.9 and zinc was 12.7 ± 2.0. Zinc but not copper concentrations decreased from early morning to late afternoon; both were unaffected by reported postprandial time. There was a positive relationship between copper and age for both sexes but zinc showed only a slight upward trend with age. A positive relationship between copper and the aggregation of classical risk factors for coronary heart disease was demonstrated.

AB  - The monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) obtained in mice immunized with human PRL coupled to an anti-PRL MAb were screened for their ability to distinguish the glycosylated (G-) and nonglycosylated (NG-) forms of PRL. The 431-29 MAb exhibited high affinity binding for NG-PRL but little or no cross-reactivity to G-PRL. Using this antibody in conjunction with other MAbs which equally recognized both forms, we developed 2 immunoradiometric assays which were used to determine the amount of G- and NG-PRL in plasma. In 85 normal subjects, NG-PRL baseline levels averaged 6.6 ± 3 Mg/L, and represented 76 ± 8% of the total PRL immunoreactivity. In 74 pregnant women, this proportion was significantly higher during the last 2 trimesters (84 ± 4% and 85 ± 6%), as compared to the first trimester (76 ± 7%). In 6 healthy volunteers studied over 24 h, 79% of the NG-PRL peaks detected using the cluster algorithm occurred concomitantly to a G-PRL peak. The mean NG-PRL/PRL ratio was significantly higher during NG-PRL pulses (81 ± 9%) than during valleys (71 ± 12%). Similarly, this ratio was significantly increased during TRH or metbclopramide stimulated PRL secretion (to 88 ± 7% and 86 ± 6%, respectively). We conclude that 1) NG-PRL is the predominant immunoassayable form of PRL in plasma; 2) both G- and NG-PRL are cosecreted but NG-PRL is the main PRL form released during spontaneous or pharmacologically induced PRL secretion.

AB  - The mechanism underlying diurnal variations in PAI-1 as well as the cellular origin of PAI-1 in subjects with high PAI-1 levels are unknown. We evaluated diurnal changes (8:00 am vs 4:00 pm) in PAI-1 (functional and immunological assays), t-PA Ag and t-PA/PAI-1 complex levels in controls and subjects with high PAI-1 levels. Three test groups were recruited among obese hyperinsulinemic subjects, emergency care unit patients with inflammatory syndrome or infection and pregnant women. The classical afternoon decrease of PAI-1 level was observed in controls and obese subjects but its amplitude was greater in the latter. The decrease in t-PA Ag and t-PA/PAI-1 complex levels was the same in controls and in obese. As, in previous studies, elevated PAI-1 levels have been correlated with insulin resistance and a decrease in insulin sensibility has been described in the early morning, it is proposed that this 'dawn phenomenon' could be implicated in the circadian variations of PAI-1 in controls and could be amplified in obese subjects. Great variability in PAI-1, t-PA Ag or t-PA/PAI-1 complex levels was observed in patients with acute inflammatory syndrome or infection for whom classical biorhythms are suppressed. No diurnal changes in PAI-1 and other fibrinolytic parameters were observed in patients with inflammatory syndrome or in pregnant women suggesting that other sources and/or other regulatory mechanisms of PAI-1 production are involved.

AB  - Insulin and glucose regulation plays a central role in regulating distribution of metabolites between udder and body tissues and, consequently, in ensuring optimum adjustment between milk yield and health stability. An experimental study was conducted into four dairy cows, between 17 weeks before and 52 weeks after calving to establish six diurnal profiles for insulin and glucose concentrations in blood plasma and undertake 18 glucose tolerance tests, nine of them simple and nine modified. The three methods used in examination provided differentiated but complementary data on the glucose-insulin system of dairy cow. Flow of metabolites in the mammary gland, in early lactation, was found to be supported by low insulin concentrations in blood plasma, reduced pancreatic response to insulinogenic stimuli, and decreased responsiveness of peripheral cells to insulin. Endocrine adaptation to catabolic metabolism had its onset as early as several weeks before calving. Alterations to insulin concentrations in blood plasma as well as to pancreatic reactivity to insulinogenic stimuli and to responsiveness of peripheral cells to insulin were found to take place at various junctures. It should be proved to use the common and modified glucose tolerance test for the description of the individual metabolic type of each single dairy cow.

AB  - We have explored temporal changes in the magnitude of dopamine (DA) interaction (DA tone) at the anterior pituitary lactotrophs related to both the nocturnal and diurnal prolactin (PRL) surges on day 8 of pregnancy, by utilizing a competitive DA D2 antagonist, domperidone (DOM). After withdrawal of blood from pregnant rats on day 7 in order to demonstrate the presence of a PRL surge, experimental rats received DOM (100 μg/kg i.v. or i.a.) at various times on day 8. Blood samples were taken immediately before and following injection of DOM at 5, 30 and 60 min. The peak PRL response to DOM occured 15 min after injection. Comparisons were made between circulating PRL levels immediately prior to and at several times following DOM administration for the various times of the day, and represented as incremental increases in PRL following DOM. During times on day 8 when PRL levels were normally low (24.00, 06.00, 12.00 and 16.00 h), pregnant rats exhibited a substantial PRL response to DOM. However, during the nocturnal PRL surge (02:00, 04.00 h) the peak PRL response to DOM was significantly lower. In sharp contrast, the PRL response to DOM administered during the diurnal PRL surge (18:00 h) was significantly higher than all other times of the day tested. In a dose-response study in which 10, 100 and 1,000 μg/kg DOM was administered at the two critical times when the response to DOM differed greatly, 02:00 and 18:00 h, there was a significantly reduced PRL response to DOM at 02:00 h compared to 18:00 h. This suggests that during the nocturnal PRL surge there is a decrease in DA interaction with D2 receptors on pituitary lactotrophs compared to the diurnal PRL surge in pregnant rats. An alternative explanation is that more PRL-releasing factor is present at 18:00 h, and removal of all the DA inhibitory input to the lactotrophs allows its full expression. In either case, this study provides clear evidence that the two PRL surges during early pregnancy are under different control mechanisms.

AB  - The present experiments investigated the hypothesis that lactation constitutes a chronic stress to the adre- nocortical system. To determine whether the normal circadian control of the adrenocortical system or the ability to mount an adequate ACTH response to stress are modified during lactation, we compared morning and evening basal and stress-induced ACTH, corticosterone (B), and PRL secretion as well as pituitary ACTH content and thymus weight in virgins and lactating females on day 10 of lactation. We also compared the capacity of B to suppress ACTH secretion in adrenalectomized virgin or lactating females, both given various B pellet replacement doses (40-130% B) for 5 days. In addition, we investigated the influence of decreased litter size and increased caloric intake on basal circadian activity in the adrenocortical system. Finally, we measured suckling-induced activation of ACTH and B release and restoration of basal morning ACTH and B levels after pup separation. In all 10-d lactating females, basal PRL levels were elevated compared to virgins and the circadian rhythm observed in virgins (P < 0.05) was absent in all lactating females. By contrast, diurnal variations in ACTH and B secretion (P < 0.05 or 0.01) were observed in all females regardless of lactation and changes in caloric intake or litter size. Plasma ACTH and B were elevated during the trough of the diurnal rhythm in mothers, compared to virgins. The amplitude of the increase in ACTH between trough and peak was greater in mothers than virgins; however, the amplitude of the increase in plasma B was greater for virgins than mothers, probably because of the higher levels of cortico- steroid binding globulin in the former. Diurnal rhythms in stress responsiveness and sensitivity of ACTH to B feedback were normal in mothers; however, the magnitude of their ACTH, B, and PRL response to ether stress was less in mothers than virgins. Attempts to normalize basal ACTH and B concentrations by increasing calorie consumption were unsuccessful. However, we found that suckling caused marked stimulation of ACTH and B secretion; moreover, within 24 h after pups removal, trough ACTH and B concentrations were restored to normal values. In summary, our results show that: 1) lactating females do exhibit circadian activity in all measures of adrenocortical system function, despite elevated ACTH and (trough) B concentrations; 2) suckling stimulates the adrenocortical system and probably accounts for the tonically elevated trough ACTH and B concentrations; 3) lactation is associated with reduced ACTH, B, and PRL responses to ether stress; and 4) B feedback on ACTH secretion is not modified in lactating mothers. We conclude that the adrenocortical system of lactating rats functions normally despite elevated basal trough concentrations of ACTH and B and the blunted responses to stress. It is unlikely that stimulated basal activity is caused by the caloric drain of lactation, and we believe that it is more closely related to the frequency and/or intensity of the suckling stimulus. © 1992 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) neurons participate in tonic inhibition of prolactin (PRL), whereas β-endorphin (β-End) and serotonin (5-HT) neurons appear to be important stimulatory links for nocturnal PRL surges that occur throughout the first half of pregnancy in the rat. The purpose of this study was to determine how these neuronal components might be organized within the pathway controlling PRL release during gestation. Maximal stimulation of DA receptors with the agonist bromocriptine mesylate (Bromo) completely blocked the PRL response to β-End (100 ng/μ1/min for 15 min) given intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) on day 8 of pregnancy. DA receptor blockade, produced by implanting a 25 mg pellet of haloperidol (Hal) on day 7 of pregnancy, resulted in PRL levels of 500-600 ng/ml by the following morning. β-End i.c.v. or 250 mg/ml/kg BW of the DA synthesis inhibitor, α-methyl-p-tyrosine (α-MPT), given during the intersurge period, were equally effective in significantly increasing PRL (p &lt; 0.01) above pretreatment levels. β-End and α-MPT evoked similar increases in rats pretreated with Hal, suggesting the stimulatory effect of β-End on nocturnal PRL surges may primarily be due to DA inhibition. The next objective was to determine how β-End and 5-HT might interact to stimulate the nocturnal surge. Day 8 pregnant rats were infused continuously with the opioid receptor blocker, naloxone hydrochloride (Nal), at a rate of 2.0 mg/10 min from 1000-13000h. The PRL response to an injection of 20 mg/kg BW 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) at 1200 h was greatly attenuated, compared to controls infused with saline instead of Nal. This suggests that 5-HT stimulates PRL, at least in part, by an action at opioid receptors. Distilled H2O or 10 mg/kg BW of the selective S2 receptor blocker, ketanserin tartrate (Ket), was given intraperitoneally (i.p.) during the intersurge period on day 8 of pregnancy. All animals demonstrated an identical response to β-End given 2 hours later, regardless of the type of pretreatment. It appears that β-End does not stimulate PRL by way of an S2 receptor. Although β-End induced a significant increase in PRL on day 16 of pregnancy, the response was attuenuated by more than 60% compared to the response on day 8 of pregnancy. This attenuation may involve placental lactogens, shown to be secreted during this time and to inhibit PRL secretion. Overall, the data from this report suggest that 5-HT acts through β-End, which in turn, inhibits DA, resulting in generation of a nocturnal PRL surge during early pregnancy, which is subsequently lost. © 1992.

AB  - We conducted a longitudinal polysomnographic study in five healthy primiparous subjects, whose sleep was first recorded between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation, then every 2 months until parturition and at 1 month postpartum. The first 6 hours of sleep were used for statistical analysis. In contrast to previous studies, we found no reduction in stage 4 sleep with pregnancy. Slow-wave sleep (comprising stages 3 and 4), was significantly higher at 27-39 weeks of gestation than at 8-16 weeks, as predicted by the restorative theory of sleep. There was no significant difference in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time. When compared to a group of normal ovulating women, however, REM sleep time decreased during the last two months of pregnancy and, although there was no change in sleep onset latency, the time spent awake during the first six hours of sleep was increased. Future research into the effects of cortisol and progesterone is indicated.

AB  - Although the circadian variation of melatonin content in the pineal gland appears during the 3rd week of extrauterine life, recent studies suggest that the fetus perceives the day length through maternal melatonin transfer. Accordingly, we determined serum melatonin concentrations in pregnant and lactat- ing rats and in their offsprings during the day (D) and at night (N). As compared with nonpregnant adult female rats (D: 6.0 ± 0.5 and N; 112.0 ± 5.0 pg/ml), significant increases of serum melatonin concentrations, both during the day and at night, were observed in 21-day pregnant (D: 21.0 ± 2.6 and N:± 7.2 pg/ml) and in 10-day (D: 20.0 ± 2.6 and N: 145.0 ± 12.3 pg/ml) and 20-day (D: 19.0 ± 1.2 and N: 140.0 ± 8.0 pg/ml) lactating animals, while a profound decrease was found in 5-day (D: 13.0 ± l.OandN: ± 5.6 pg/ml) lactating rats. In addition, melatonin levels were significantly higher during the night than during the day in all the experimental groups. High levels and circadian variation of serum melatonin were detected also in 21-day-old fetuses (D: 13.0 ± 0.8 and N: 108.0 ± 4.8 pg/ml) and in 5- and 10-day-old suckling (in 5-day-old, D: 13.0 ± 0.6 and N; 71.0 ± 3.1 pg/ml; in 10-day-old, D: 17.0 ± 1.4 and N: 63.0 ± 3.8 pg/ml) rats. Circulating melatonin was not detectable in pinealectomized 21-day pregnant and 10-day lactating mothers, and in their offsprings, except for small amounts of melatonin determined at night in fetal (6.0 ±1.1 pg/ml) and during the day (4.0 ± 2.0 pg/ml) and at night (15.0 ± 2.5 pg/ml) in suckling rats. These results demonstrate significant fluctuations of serum melatonin levels in pregnant and lactating rats and provide evidence that the circadian variations of circulating melatonin in fetal and suckling rats is dependent on maternal melatonin transfer. © 1992 S.

AB  - Endogenous opioid peptides (EOPs) stimulate prolactin (PRL) release in various physiological conditions in the rat. Moreover, EOPs are essential in initiating and maintaining the nocturnal PRL surges that occur over the first halfof gestation in the rat. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role of the opioid β-endorphin (β-End) in mediating the nocturnal PRL surges. Day 8 pregnant rats received an infusion of2.5, 10, 25 or 100 ng/μ l/min β-End intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) for 15 min at 12, 00 h, an intcrsurge period. PRL increased in a dose-dependent manner and from this, the largest dose was used in subsequent experiments to ensure maximal opioid receptor stimulation. The next experiment defined the temporal sensitivity of the neuroendocrine system regulating PRL surges to exogenous β-End. Day 8 pregnant rats showed dramatic PRL responses to β-End when given at midnight (presurge) or 12.00 h (intersurge), but greatly attenuated responses at 02.00 h (early surge) and 04.00 h (late surge). Animals treated at 06.00 h (postsurge) showed recovered responsiveness to β-End. To determine what may account for the significantly lower PRL increases to β-End during the surge, day 8 pregnant rats received 100 ng/μl/min β -End i.c.v. for 15 min at 10.00 h, and then again at 12.00 h. All animals showed PRL increases greater than 1, 140 ng/ml at 10.00 h. but the subsequent response to β-End at 12.00 h was reduced by 70%. In another experiment, β-End was infused at midnight and the animals were monitored for a subsequent endogenous nocturnal PRL surge. Although all animals showed a rapid increase in PRL following β -End treatment, 5 of 8 animals did not have a nocturnal PRL surge. This suggests that the initial β-End may down regulate its receptors, and therefore account for the much lower PRL response to β-End during the surge. To determine whether an insufficient amount of pituitary PRL may account for the small response to β-End during the surge, hemipituitary PRE concentration was measured. Pituitary PRL concentration was found to be lower at 04.09 h, when the incremental increase in plasma PRL to β-End was smallest, compared to the concentration at midnight, when the response was highest. However, at 02.00 h, pituitary PRL levels were similar to those at midnight, yet the PRL response to β-End differed greatly at these 2 times. Based on these results, lower pituitary PRL concentration during the nocturnal surge may only partially account for the attenuated PRL response to [1-End. Down regulation of β-end receptors or less dopamine available for inhibition by β-End in the tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons also are likely explanations. © 1992 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - This study was attempted to observe the rate of oxygen desaturation after full oxygenation in six parturients scheduled for Cesarean sections and six patients scheduled for transabdominal hysterectomies. We calculated the mean rate of fall of arterial saturation (slope of desaturation: less than SaO2 (t2)-SaO2(t1) greater than/t2-t1) and changes in arterial blood gases were observed. All subjects were denitrogenated then a single isolated apnea was carried out. The mean time to obtain 90% saturation was longer in the nonpregnant group (7.5 min vs 3.6 min in parturients). The mean slope of desaturation was steeper in the parturients (-3.34) than the nonpregnant group (-1.52). As far as the oxygen reserve is concerned, the parturients had a lesser margin of safety than the nonpregnant women. It was concluded that the lower the thoracic gas volume (parturients), the lower the alveolar O2 stores and, the more rapidly these stores are depleted.

AB  - Harris’ 1948 hypothesis (1) that anterior pituitary function is regulated by hypothalamic factors released into and carried by the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal blood to the adenohypophysis was not lost upon clinical investigators. Soon thereafter G. W. Liddle, for example, referred to this regulatory influence of the central nervous system as the “pituitary driving mechanism” (2), recognizing that such a mechanism was essential for explaining the diurnal rhythm in pituitary-adrenal axis function and its response to stress. According to this concept, the pituitary driving mechanism was the variable force against which cortisol exerted its negative feedback inhibitory action on ACTH secretion. Long before CRH [ovine CRH (oCRH) mol wt = 4671; human CRH (hCRH) mol wt = 4758] was isolated, characterized, and synthesized (3), vasopressin [either arginine vasopressin (AVP) or lysine vasopressin (LVP)] was known to cause release of ACTH from the pituitary gland and, as a consequence, to increase adrenal cortisol production. Although vasopressin saw limited investigative and diagnostic use, its acceptance as the major physiological mediator of the pituitary driving mechanism was limited because of its known vasopressor and antidiuretic activities, the observation that patients with isolated diabetes insipidus generally had normal pituitary-adrenal function, and the suspicion that the ACTH released in response to vasopressin administration was nonspecific, resulting from the stress of the unpleasant side effects of pharmacological doses of the peptide. Consequently, the discovery of CRH offered a potential explanation for many unsolved clinical questions, and the availability of pure synthetic CRH provided a research and diagnostic tool whose potential was quickly exploited by many clinical investigators. © 1992 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - OBJECTIVE - To develop a sensitive and reliable immunoradiometric assay to measure glycosylated lysine residues on serum proteins (GSP) and to evaluate its efficacy in monitoring glycemic control. RESEARCH DESIGN - The effect of acute and chronic in vitro and in vivo changes in glucose levels on GSP concentration was evaluated. GSP determinations from insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) patients, non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients, and control subjects were correlated with other indices of glycemic control. RESULTS - The GSP levels were unaffected by acute glucose changes after food or intravenous glucose administration but increased during storage at -20°C due to in vitro glycosylation by endogenous glucose. Immediate acidification of the serum prevented this, permitting long-term storage despite high ambient glucose levels. In randomly selected diabetic patients, 96% of GSP values were greater than the mean +3SD of nondiabetic control subjects. In diabetic patients, GSP levels correlated with mean plasma glucose concentrations (Kendall correlation statistics 0.47, P < 0.001), fasting plasma glucose levels (Kendall statistics 0.42, P < 0.001), and glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb, Kendall statistics 0.30, P < 0.005). Induction of near-normal glycemia in poorly controlled NIDDM patients reduced GSP levels with a slope consistent with a half time of disappearance of 4.7 ± 0.4 days. GSP levels remained elevated in 6 of 10 well-controlled NIDDM patients, despite normal GHb concentrations. Chronic hypoglycemic states, like pregnancy and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, were associated with significantly low GSP levels. CONCLUSION - We describe a reproducible and sensitive immunoradiometric assay for GSP that closely reflects the degree of glycemic control in diabetic patients. Further studies are needed to determine whether this assay may be useful in screening for glucose intolerance or gestational diabetes.

AB  - Infanticide is a violent but successful reproductive strategy found in many mammals, particularly rodents. In male house mice (Mus domesticus and M. musculus) the act of ejaculation provides a reliable neural signal for timing the birth of their offspring. However, a unique chronobiological aspect of this phenomenon is the extraordinary temporal latency that can occur between the stimulus (coital ejaculation) and its adaptive neural response (male mice cease killing pups and behave parentally toward them instead). Specifically, the inhibition of infanticide is often time delayed for many days after a male ejaculates, but virtually always occurs before or around the time his own sired offspring would be born 18-20 days later. Furthermore, infanticide spontaneously reemerges 50-60 days after mating. In CF-1 stock male mice this entire behavioral sequence is synchronized with the female's reproductive cycle, and occurs even in the total absence of social cues or changes in pituitary or gonadal hormones after mating. When entrained and mated at 22 h (lightdark 11:11) or 27 h (lightdark 13.5:13.5) T-cycles, photoperiodic cues appeared to synchronize this dramatic shift in behavior, because a sudden transition from pup killing to parenting was matched with the number of light/dark cycles experienced after ejaculation rather than the amount of real time experienced, suggesting a circadian timing link. Housing in constant light accelerated the postmating transition to parenting, whereas constant dark significantly delayed the transition to parenting, but still occurred by 3 weeks after mating. Most males tend to oscillate between infanticide and parental behavior for several days before locking in to constant parenting, regardless of lighting conditions. Variation in the time delay between ejaculation and the inhibition of infanticide was consistent within young individuals (<10 months of age), but in older males (> 18 months of age) the time interval between ejaculation and parenting was significantly prolonged and attenuated. Another unique aspect of this phenomenon is that variation among individuals in their timing and response to light cues is correlated with phenotypic variation in sex steroid exposure during late fetal development. So far, no simple physiological explanation can account for the neural mechanism triggered by ejaculation that coordinates these time-delayed behavioral changes toward pups. © 1992 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - A study of the knowledge, attitudes to and practice of contraception among the female students at the Institute of Management and Technology (IMT), Enugu, was carried out, involving 266 female students out of a total female student population of 1,510. The mean age of the population sample was 19.1 years and 254 (95%) were single. Ninety-six percent were aware of the availability of contraceptives. Knowledge relating to the practice of contraception was superficial since as many as 61% of the objectors believed that contraception subsequently led to infertility. One hundred and thirty (49%) of the studied population had used one form of contraception or another sometime in their lives. Seventy-six percent had not used any contraception for initial intercourse. The rhythm method followed by the barrier method were the most popular forms of contraception. Practice of contraception by the studied population was inconsistent as 21% of the students eventually had an unwanted pregnancy and 18% had an induced abortion. Health education is strongly recommended to our women folk in order to reduce the high incidence of unwanted pregnancy and its associated medical and social complications. © 1992 The Society of Public Health.

AB  - Rat choriocarcinoma (Rcho) cells, which are morphologically similar to trophoblast giant cells of the normal placenta and produce placental lactogen-I in vivo, were used to investigate placental feedback on PRL secretion and tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neuronal activity. Rcho cells were injected into female rats either intracerebroventricularly 60-65 h before use or under the kidney capsule 10-14 days before use. T(je following endocrine conditions were used: 1) ovariectomized rats with or without bromocriptine treatment, 2) immature (40-44 days old) rats, 3) adult cycling (diestrous) rats, and 4) pregnant rats. Serum PRL levels in ovariectomized, diestrous, and immature female rats were suppressed to less than 20% of control levels by secretions from the Rcho cells. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity in the stalk-median eminence (SME) was increased 2-fold above control activity in Rcho- treated ovariectomized and immature female rats. When TH activity was reduced to 40% of control levels by 50 h of bromocriptine treatment, secretions from Rcho cells increased TH activity 3.5-fold to levels similar to those for Rcho alone. Even though Rcho treatment suppressed PRL levels, TH activity in the SME of cycling (diestrous) rats was not altered after either central (65 h) or peripheral (12 days) administration of cells. TH mRNA levels in the arcuate nuclei were unaltered by Rcho cells in immature female and adult cycling rats. TH mRNA levels in ovariectomized rats were markedly reduced 75% by 50 h of bromocriptine treatment and modestly reduced 33% 65 h after injection of Rcho cells. However, Rcho cells partially reversed the bromocriptine-induced decline in TH mRNA to levels seen for Rcho cells alone. On day 7 of pregnancy, secretions from Rcho cells abolished the nocturnal and diurnal PRL surges characteristic of early pregnancy and suppressed circulating PRL levels throughout the day to less than 20% of intersurge PRL levels. Rcho cells eliminated the semicircadian rhythm in TH activity in the SME, which was out of phase with the twice daily PRL surges of early pregnancy. TH activity was increased by Rcho factor(s) at 0330 h (nocturnal surge) and 1800 h (diurnal surge), but not at 1000 h (intersurge). MMQ cells, pituitary-derived clonal PRL-secreting cells, similarly terminated the biphasic rhythm of PRL release and tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neuronal activity during early pregnancy. These data indicate that a factor(s) secreted by Rcho cells markedly suppresses circulating PRL levels, in part by increasing tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neuronal activity. However, the dopaminergic neurons are probably not the sole site for Rcho action. Furthermore, these results suggest that a factor(s) secreted by trophoblast cells, possibly placental lactogen-I, contributes to the elim-ination of the semicircadian rhythm in TH activity and, thus, to the termination of the PRL surges at midpregnancy. © 1992 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Self‐reported sleep disturbances and levels of vitality and fatigue were studied in a secondary analysis of 25 pregnant and 29 postpartum employed women. Results indicate that pregnant women have problems initiating and maintaining sleep, and postpartum women have problems maintaining sleep, but not falling asleep. The primary reason for midsleep awakenings was urinary frequency among the pregnant women, and child care responsibilities among the postpartum women. Chronic sleep disturbance was indicated by a greater percentage of postpartum women who fell asleep easily, very few who felt highly energetic at work, and most who perceived a high level of fatigue during the past week. Even with these sleep disruptions, no differences occurred in the mean scores for perception of fatigue und vitality between the two groups. Clinicians can use these findings to educate women about some changes they may anticipate and how they might manage them during pregnancy and postpartum Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - We observed fetal behavior by using three ultrasonic real-time scanners simultaneously in 30 normal pregnant women between 20 and 40 weeks of gestation and analyzed developmental changes in behavioral pattern focussing the attention on the characteristics of REM and non-REM sleep and wakeful state. The frequency of REM significantly increased with gestational age, and its occurrences formed a group in late pregnancy. REM and non-REM periods, which were defined as the phase with uninterrupted appearance of rapid eye movements and the phase without them over 3 min, respectively, became clearly distinguishable between 28 and 31 weeks of gestation. The correlation between the occurrence of rapid eye movements and breathing movements was high after 27 weeks. These results demonstrate the course of the development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in the human fetus. © 1992.

AB  - Several changes in maternal physiology may profoundly alter sleep, especially during late pregnancy. Any condition that causes maternal hypoxemia will be worsened during sleep, particularly in the supine position. Although high circulating levels of progesterone increase respiratory drive during sleep, in at least some women this protective mechanism is insufficient to prevent sleep-disordered breathing and hypoxemia. The true incidence of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy remains unknown. Although many women report sleep disturbance during pregnancy, those with severe snoring, observed irregular breathing with sleep, or excessive daytime somnolence should be referred for clinical polysomnography. With few data thus far available, nasal CPAP would appear to be the treatment of choice. Given the possible consequences of sleep apnea for fetal outcome, any significant sleep-disordered breathing is probably an indication for treatment.

AB  - Twelve women in their third trimester of pregnancy and 10 age-matched nonpregnant controls underwent complete polysomnography for one night in the laboratory. Seven of the original women returned for a second study 3-5 months postpartum. During late pregnancy, women showed increased wake after sleep onset (WASO) and a lower sleep efficiency in comparison with the control group. The percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was significantly decreased and the percentage of stage 1 significantly increased compared to the nonpregnant group. At 3-5 months postpartum, a significant reduction in WASO and increased sleep efficiency were noted. However, only a slight increase was noted in REM sleep during the postpartum period compared to the prepartum period. The most frequent sleep complaints in the pregnant group were restless sleep, low back pain, leg cramps and frightening dreams. In summary, in accordance with their complaints, women in their third trimester demonstrated polysomnographic patterns of sleep maintenance insomnia.

AB  - Continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep studies were obtained on healthy full-term and preterm infants at matched conceptional ages. Studies were recorded under environmentally controlled conditions. Eighteen healthy preterm infants were matched to 18 full-term infants based on conceptional age, sex, race and socioeconomic class. The initial 3 hours of a 12-hour recording were simultaneously recorded on paper and computer. The visually scored data based on the paper recordings for sleep architecture and continuity measures were studied. Differences in each sleep organization for the preterm infants included the following: a longer ultradian sleep cycle (70 minutes vs. 53 minutes, p = 0.02) was noted. More abundant trace alternant (34% vs. 28%, p = 0.02) and less abundant low-voltage irregular active sleep (13% vs. 17%, p = 0.05) were noted. Although no differences were observed for sleep latency and efficiency, the preterm infants had fewer numbers and shorter durations of arousals, fewer body movements and rapid eye movement (REM) (p < 0.01), particularly during quiet sleep. The extrauterine experience or the earlier birth of the preterm infant may influence specific sleep architecture and continuity measures when compared with the sleep of full-term infants who experienced a complete intrauterine gestation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE - To evaluate the incidence and predisposing factors of severe hypoglycemia (SH) in pregnant women with insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - SH (impairment of consciousness due to hypoglycemia subsequently treated with glucagon or i.v. glucose) was recorded in all pregnant type I diabetic women (n = 77) who attended our pregnancy clinic during 85 pregnancies from 1986 to 1990. RESULTS - Ninety- four SHs were reported during 35 pregnancies. Of 94 SHs, 84% occurred before the 20th gestational wk (median 12th wk) and 77% during sleep. In the group with SH, there was no permanent maternal sequelae, and there was a favorable fetal outcome (no perinatal death and no congenital malformation). Mean HbA(1c) values were not different between the group with and without SH for the first half (6.4 ± 1.1 vs. 6.3 ± 0.9%) and 2nd half (5.4 ± 0.6 vs. 5.5 ± 0.7%) of pregnancy. The percentage of women with SH before pregnancy (51 vs. 28%, P < 0.05) and the incidence of SH patients before pregnancy (0.49 vs. 0.08 SH/patient/yr) was different between the group with and without SH. CONCLUSIONS - SH is frequent during pregnancies of type I diabetic women with near normoglycemia. The risk for SH is particularly pronounced during the first half of pregnancy and in women with a history of SH.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that twins, when monitored simultaneously, show a remarkably high incidence of coincident fetal heart rate accelerations (about 58%). The current study examines synchrony of behavior patterns in twins. STUDY DESIGN: We examined 37 fetal monitor strips from 15 sets of twins with simultaneous fetal heart rate and fetal movement recorded by means of Doppler techniques (Toitu MT-430 fetal actocardiograph). The strips were analyzed for coincidence of fetal heart rate accelerations and fetal movement episodes and then conceptually for synchrony of fetal behavior patterns on the basis of descriptions of behavioral states by Prechtl. RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of fetal heart rate accelerations were found to be simultaneous. Forty-three percent of movement epochs were considered simultaneous. We found that twins exhibited synchronous behavior patterns (basically sleep or awake state) 94.7% of the time. CONCLUSION Twin-twin interactions are more consistently related than suspected when observation is limited to heart. rate alone, and the synchrony and role of fetal behavior states must be considered when twin interactions and behavior are studied.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to study the sleep quality in women with preeclampsia with a special reference to nocturnal body movement activity. STUDY DESIGN: Sleep quality was evaluated in nine women with preeclampsia and eight women with normal term pregnancy by means of questionnaires and by recording the nocturnal body movement activity with the static charge-sensitive bed. RESULTS: Subjective sleep complaints were similar in both groups. The total movement time and the total frequency of body movements in bed were, however, significantly increased in the preeclamptic group. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that sleep is impaired in preeclamptic subjects. © 1992, Mosby. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate whether micturition occurs, temporally related to the onset of the rapid eye movement (REM) period, in the human fetus. The study was made on 139 fetuses at 33-36 weeks and 153 at 37-41 weeks gestation. The discrepancies between the expected (Fexp) and observed (Fobs) frequencies of time lag between the onset of the REM period and the first micturition thereafter were assessed using the goodness-of-fit test. At 33-36 weeks gestation, there was no statistical difference between Fobs and Fexp (P &gt; 0.05). At 37 weeks onwards, however, significant differences were noted between Fobs and Fexp (P &lt; 0.005). Seventy-two percent of all micturitions occurred within eight minutes after the onset of the REM period. This indicates that there is a temporal relationship between the onset of the REM period and the first micturition thereafter, at term, during 37-41 weeks of gestation. © 1992.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Thirteen women in late stages of pregnancy underwent a polysomnographic study. Eight women (61%) complained of mild nocturnal back pain or back discomfort. Five women (39%) did not complain of nocturnal back pain. The two groups did not differ in total bed time, total sleep time, sleep latency, and wake after sleep onset (WASO). A significant decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and an increase in stage 2 were observed in the pain group. The same group had a statistically significant decrease in the basal O2 saturation level. The pain group also spent a longer time sleeping in the supine position. We hypothesize that a prolonged stay in the supine position leads to obstruction of the vena cava. In the presence of inadequate collateral circulation, increased pressure and venostasis in combination with a decrease in basal oxygen saturation may lead to hypoxemia, compromise the metabolic supply of the neural structures, and result in pain. It appears, therefore, that the vascular system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of pain. The role played by the disturbed sleep architecture in the production of pain remains to be established. It is possible that the changes observed in sleep architecture result from pain rather than contribute to pain production;. 1992 Munksgaard

AB  - Summary: We report the chance observation of two generalized seizures in a fetal lamb that received cocaine. Cocaine was infused intravenously into a 138‐day‐old fetus while electrocortical (ECoG), electroocular (EOG), and neck electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded. Fetal rapid eye movement (REM) and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep were disrupted during the cocaine exposure and returned to a normal pattern after infusions were stopped. Seventy‐two hours later, however, we recorded generalized seizures with ECoG spike and spike wave activity. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Periodic breathing (PB) is a pattern of breathing that is frequently recognized in infants being studied for possible sleep apnea. Infants presenting to a sleep laboratory over a 3 1/2 -year period who had evidence on their initial study of prolonged (>15% of total sleep time) PB were prospectively studied in an effort to determine the significance of this pattern of breathing. Of the 331 infants studied, 40 demonstrated prolonged PB. Sixteen of these infants, who were of 37 weeks' gestation or greater at birth and did not receive pharmacologic therapy, were studied on at least two occasions (group 1). Of the remaining 24 infants, 11 were treated with methylxanthines by their attending physician (group 2), and 13 did not return for sequential studies (group 3). All infants who were of less than 37 weeks' gestation at birth were separately evaluated (group 4). For group 1, who were studied at a mean age of 5 postnatal weeks, there was a mean of 36.4% periodicity which decreased on the second study to 18.0%. By the fourth study, this had decreased to 9.2%. In group 2, there was a mean of 41.3% periodicity during the first study which decreased to 6.4% on the second study. Infants of group 3 had a mean of 31.4% PB on their initial study and the premature infants, group 4, had 30.1% PB. All infants showed a decrease in PB with sequential studies and no infant was known to have died of sudden infant death syndrome or any other disorder in the first year of life. For the majority of infants, the abnormal duration of PB was the only abnormality noted on the sleep recording. The results suggest that excess PB as an isolated abnormality on a sleep recording is not an indicator of subsequent risk. Additional longitudinal evaluations of this respiratory pattern are needed.

AB  - Abstract New Zealand's high mortality rate from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) prompted the development of the New Zealand Cot Death Study. A report of the analysis of the data from the first year has been published. This report now gives the major identified risk factors from the full 3 year data set. In this case‐control study there were 485 infants who died from SIDS in the post‐neonatal age group, and 1800 control infants, who were a representative sample of all hospital births in the study region. Obstetric records were examined and parental interviews were completed in 97.5% and 86.9% of subjects, respectively. As expected many risk factors for SIDS were confirmed including: lower socio‐economic status, unmarried mother, young mother, younger school‐leaving age of mother, younger age of mother at first pregnancy, late attendance at antenatal clinic, non‐attendance at antenatal classes, Maori, greater number of previous pregnancies, the further south the domicile, winter, low birthweight, short gestation, male infant and admission to a special care baby unit. In addition, however, we identified four risk factors that are potentially amenable to modification. These were the prone sleeping position of the baby (odds ratio (OR) = 3.70; 95% confidence interval (Cl) = 2.91, 4.70); bed sharing (OR = 2.70; 95% Cl = 2.02, 3.62); maternal smoking of 1–9 cigarettes per day (OR = 3.47; 95% Cl = 2.50, 4.83), 10–19 cigarettes per day (OR = 3.94; 95% Cl = 2.87, 5.41) or more than 20 cigarettes per day (OR = 5.90; 95% Cl = 4.20, 8.31); and not breast feeding (OR = 2.39; 95% Cl = 1.88, 3.04). After controlling for all of the above variables, the relative risks associated with prone sleeping position (OR = 4.84). sharing bed (OR = 2.02), maternal smoking (OR = 1.79) and not breast feeding (OR = 1.89) were still statistically significant. Population‐attributable risk calculations suggest that these four risk factors may account for 82% of deaths from SIDS. The SIDS mortality rate may fall to less than 0.7/1000 live births if all parents stop putting their infants down to sleep in the prone position, do not sleep with their baby, do not smoke, and breast feed their infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to measure central nervous system insult from prenatal phenobarbital by quantified electroencephalographic evaluation of mature rat offspring. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four adult female rats were given phenobarbital as 0, 20, 40, or 60 mg/kg/day subcutaneously between 9 and 10 Ann for 28 days before breeding and throughout gestation. The electroencephalograms of 90-day-old offspring were sampled over 24 hours and converted to the power spectra. RESULTS: Female offspring exposed prenatally to 20 mg and males exposed prenatally to 40 mg displayed an increase in delta and a decrease in alpha and middle-beta waveform activities. Females exposed prenatally to 40 mg and males exposed prenatally to 60 mg displayed decreases in delta, theta, alpha, and middle-beta activities. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal phenobarbital exposure produced dose- and sex-dependent changes in the electroencephalogram of mature offspring consistent with a generalized deficit in the neuronal synchronization mechanisms that are critical for normal sleep and learning. © 1992.

AB  - Objective. —To evaluate cerebral cortical function with electroencephalography in infants of cocaine-addicted mothers. Design. —Patient series. Setting. —The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (Pa). Participants. —Thirty-five consecutive infants of cocaine-addicted mothers hospitalized for a comprehensive health assessment and 51 healthy, age-matched infants studied with electroencephalography and respiratory thermistor because they were siblings of sudden infant death victims (comparison group). Interventions. —None. Measurements/Main Results. —Behavioral states during spontaneous daytime sleep were classified as active sleep or quiet sleep; quiet sleep was further characterized as immature, tracé alternant sleep or mature, continuous, slow wave sleep. No episodes of ictal apnea or nonictal apnea were recorded in infants of cocaine-addicted mothers; nonictal apnea was observed in one control patient. No electrographic seizures were recorded. There were no significant differences between the proportions of infants exposed to cocaine in utero and that of controls who displayed excessive sharp electroencephalographic transients, background abnormalities, immaturity, and hypermaturity. Electroclinical sleep discordance was present in 5.7% of infants of cocaine-addicted mothers vs 0% of controls. Cocaine-exposed infants displayed mature, continuous, slow wave sleep below 45 weeks of conceptional age in a significantly higher percentage than those in the comparison group. Conclusions. —Although frank electroencephalographic abnormalities were infrequent in infants whose mothers were addicted to cocaine, they differed significantly in their younger age of onset of continuous, slow wave sleep. Our findings provide continued reason for concern that infants of cocaine-addicted mothers may suffer subtle adverse neurologic, cognitive, or behavioral effects later in life. The longitudinal assessment of sleep disturbance and its relation to later development might permit tracking of the long-term effects of prenatal exposure to cocaine. © 1992, American Medical Association.

AB  - To investigate the mechanisms controlling baseline fetal heart rate (BFHR) at different gestational ages (GA) and behavioral sleep states, 10 chronically instrumented (nonvagotomized, control) and 9 vagotomized fetal lambs were used. BFHR was assessed in active and quiet behavioral states at 124-147 days gestation. Fetal electrocorticogram, electrooculogram, and breathing movements were used to distinguish behavioral states. Inverse relationships were found between BFHR and GA for both states in the control group, with a steeper regression slope during active sleep (P < 0.001). Vagotomized BFHR decreased with GA and the regression lines for both states nearly coincided. In active states before 135 days, BFHR in the controls was significantly higher than vagotomized BFHR. After 135 days, control BFHR was significantly lower than vagotomized BFHR [P < 0.001 (< 135 days), P < 0.005 (> 135 days)]. During quiet sleep, control BFHR was greater than vagotomized BFHR throughout the entire gestational period [P < 0.001 (< 135 days), P < 0.05 (> 135 days)]. These results suggest that in the active state, vagal influence on fetal heart rate is enhanced after 135 days. During quiet sleep, vagal activity remains low before and after 135 days. In addition, sympathetic activity appears to be diminished in the vagotomized sheep. © 1992 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - To investigate the effects of bilateral cervical vagotomy on arousal and breathing responses, we studied eight sham-operated and eight chronically instrumented unanesthetized vagotomized sheep fetuses between 136 and 144 days of gestation (term ~147 days). Each fetus was instrumented to record sleep states, diaphragmatic electromyogram, blood pressure, pH, and blood gas tensions. In a randomized order, fetal lungs were distended with four different O2 concentrations: 0 (100% N2), 21, 50, and 100% at a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cmH2O via an in situ Y-endotracheal tube. Under control conditions, inspiratory time and the duration of the single longest breathing episode decreased from 598 ± 99 (SD) ms and 24 ± 10 min in sham group to 393 ± 162 ms and 11.0 + 3.0 min in vagotomized group (P = 0.04 and 0.033), respectively. In response to lung distension with 100% N2, breathing time decreased from 44 ± 17 to 20 ± 18% (P = 0.045) in sham- operated fetuses, whereas it remained unchanged in the vagotomized group. In response to 100% O2, fetal arterial PO2 increased in five of eight fetuses sham-operated from 18.2 ± 5.1 to 227 + 45 Torr (P &lt; 0.0001) and in six of eight vagotomized fetuses from 18.5 ± 4.4 to 172 ± 39 Torr (P &lt; 0.001). Although arousal was observed in all oxygenated fetuses at the onset of breathing, the duration of arousal was markedly attenuated in vagotomized fetuses (14 ± 10 vs. 46 ± 29 min in sham group; P - 0.024). Frequency and amplitude of breathing and respiratory output (frequency x amplitude) increased only in sham group (P = 0.02, 0.004, and 0.0002, respectively). We conclude that in response to lung distension and oxygenation, arousal and stimulation of breathing during active and quiet sleep are critically dependent on intact vagal nerves.

AB  - During evaluation for palpitations, presyncope, or syncope, seven pregnant women had documented ventricular tachycardia. Before pregnancy none had a history of significant cardiac disease or symptomatic arrhythmia. The tachycardia rate ranged from 117 to 250 beats/min and lasted up to 65 seconds. Arrhythmia evaluation in five of the patients suggested catecholamine-sensitive ventricular tachycardia. This diagnosis was supported by either a positive relation to exercise or isoproterenol infusion, suppression of arrhythmia by β-blockade or sleep, and lack of induction of arrhythmia by programmed electrical stimulation of the heart. The arrhythmias resolved in one patient soon after evaluation and in one other patient after 2 months of controlling therapy. Five other patients continued to receive therapy throughout pregnancy. Delivery was accomplished in all patients without significant maternal or neonatal complications. © 1992.

AB  - Current practices for the prevention and treatment of malaria in children and in pregnant women in the Brazzaville Region (Congo) were studied in 1989 and 1990. Information was obtained by interviewing a total of 1152 subjects. Overall, chemoprophylaxis was used less than was the systematic treatment of fever. Fever was treated before seeking medical advice in over 50% of the cases. Two-thirds of those interviewed reported that they slept under mosquito nets. Families with lower socio-economic standards were less likely to use chemoprophylaxis, to have antimalarials in the home, and to own mosquito nets; and they were more likely to prefer injections and to purchase drugs in the local markets.

AB  - The aim of this study was to reappraise the effects of maternal meperidine administration on breathing pattern during the first hours of life taking into account the state of alertness. Because breathing instability is more pronounced during active sleep, we hypothesized that meperidine administration might create a greater risk for respiratory instability during active sleep, the prominent sleep state in newborns. We studied eight full-term, healthy newborns whose mothers had received a continuous i.v. infusion of meperidine (81 ± 9 mg) that was terminated 5.5 ± 2.1 h before delivery. These infants were compared with a control group of eight full-term newborns whose mothers did not receive any opioids. In both groups, all babies were delivered vaginally after a normal labor and had Apgar scores of 9 or 10 at 1 and 5 min. Neonatal gastric secretion and maternal venous and umbilical venous blood were sampled at delivery for determination of meperidine concentration. From 60 to 300 min after delivery, behavioral sleep states and thoracic and abdominal movement as well as transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (Sao2) were monitored continuously. The number of apneic spells lasting more than 3 s during 100 min of recording and the percentage of time with Sao2 below 90% in each sleep state were recorded. During quiet sleep, all respiratory variables were similar in both groups. During active sleep, there were significantly more apneic episodes (37.1 ± 25.1 versus 11.2 ± 13.9) and a higher percentage of time with Sao2 &lt; 90% (143 ± 16.7% versus 1.3 ± 1.5%) in the meperidine group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, the percentage of time with Sao2 &lt; 90% was significantly correlated with maternal meperidine dose (p &lt; 0.02), drug-delivery interval (p &lt; 0.01), and gastric concentration of meperidine (p &lt; 0.01). These data show that maternal administration of meperidine induces respiratory abnormalities in healthy, full-term newborns that occur only during active sleep. This result indicates that the state of alertness has to be characterized during the monitoring of long-term neonatal respiratory effects of any narcotic agent. In addition, we speculate that maternal meperidine administration may provoke more severe respiratory disturbances in at-risk neonates and that respiratory monitoring during the first hours of life may be useful in these newborns. © 1992 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - The relationships between self‐reported assessments of the quality of the preoperative night's sleep, preoperative anxiety, and several biochemical and physiological indicators of stress reaction were investigated in pregnant women at term receiving no premedication (n = 15), a placebo tablet (n = 15), diazepam 5 mg p.o. (n = 15), or atropine 0.01 mg/kg i.m. (n = 15), in connection with spinal analgesia for elective caesarean section. In the patients receiving no premedication, the subjective estimate of the quality of the preoperative night's sleep was negatively associated with concentrations of noradrenaline (NA) and its metabolite, 3‐methoxy‐4‐hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in CSF, and with plasma adrenaline. The anxiolytic effect of diazepam was reflected as significantly lower plasma levels of another metabolite of NA, 3,4‐dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG). Placebo and diazepam, and to a lesser extent atropine, confounded the statistical relationships between the clinical and biochemical responses found in the patients with no premedication. On the whole, the biochemical monoamine measurements were of little use in determining the clinical effects of different kinds of premedicants. © 1992 Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Fonden

AB  - We developed a new method to monitor fetal medullary respiratory neurons utilizing a two-stage approach. At 129-133 days of gestation, sheep were anesthetized, and a window was placed over the area of the fourth ventricle. After a recovery period of 3-5 days, the fetus was exteriorized into a saline bath under maternal spinal anesthesia, and the head was connected rigidly to a stereotaxic frame. Microelectrodes were inserted into the area of the nucleus tractus solitarius during rapid-eye-movement sleep, and extracellular recordings of 223 respiratory neurons were analyzed: 76% were inspiratory, 9% expiratory, and 15% phase spanning, as classified by visual and computer correlation to diaphragmatic activity. More detailed analysis of 100 neurons was done to assess the respiratory component (η2) by use of a modification of the method developed by Orem and Dick (J. Neurophysiol. 50: 1098-1107, 1983). With use of cohorts of 25 breaths, fetal respiratory neurons were found to frequently change their phase relationship to diaphragmatic activity. The η2 statistic of fetal respiratory neurons was not a stable characteristic but changed over time. This could be a reflection of an immature central respiratory system before birth or the lack of major sensory inputs.

AB  - Sensitivity to alcohol may influence the severity of prenatal alcohol effects. To examine this hypothesis, the ontogeny of thermoregulation was measured in prenatal ethanol exposed offspring of mice selected for differences in alcohol sensitivity. Pregnant long‐sleep (LS) and short‐sleep (SS) mice were exposed to 3 or 4 g/kg ethanol or an isocaloric amount of maltose‐dextrin twice per day from day 7 through 18 of pregnancy. Doses were given six hours apart via gavage. Nonintubated lab chow controls were included for both genotypes. Offspring were fostered at birth to lactating mice of an outbred strain. Offspring temperatures were measured at 0, 60, and 120 min away from the nest on alternating days from 7 through 21 days of age. LS and SS offspring prenatally exposed to the high ethanol dose showed lower temperatures at the 60 and 120 min time points on each day of testing compared to all other treatment groups. Temperatures of offspring prenatally exposed to the low ethanol dose did not differ from controls. These results suggest a relatively steep dose‐response curve for thermoregulatory deficits in LS and SS offspring prenatally exposed to alcohol.

AB  - Recent advances in immunohistochemistry have revealed the precise distribution of various neurotransmitter systems, their projections and ultrastructure in the brain. Based on these data, the structure and function of specific neurons or a group of neurons in the brain can be understood in terms of the dynamics of the neurotransmitters they utilize. This strategy of neuroscience may be utilized to explore higher brain functions such as learning, memory, cognition and sleep. Prenatal exposure of pregnant rats to methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) on day 15 of gestation produces offspring with severe microcephaly (MAM‐rats). These MAM‐rats show various behavioral abnormalities in learning, memory and cognition as well as hyperactivity and reduction of paradoxical sleep. Developmental abnormalities of serotonin (5HT) fibers in the cerebral cortex and 5HT neurons in raphe nuclei are examined. The cell deficits of cortical target neurons and irregularly arranged cortical layers were observed. Developmental abnormalities of 5HT neurons are discussed in terms of target dependent secondary degeneration. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) has an important role in behavioral modification. VIP is suggested to have a functional correlation with 5HT in the brain. The reduction of VIP neurons and hypo‐aggregation of their axonal boutons were observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of infant MAM‐rats. However, in adult MAM‐rats, VIP axonal boutons showed layer‐dependent hyper‐ or hypo‐aggregation compared with the age‐matched control. The difference in the number of VIP neurons became small between the controls and MAM‐rats. These immunohistochemical observations of brain defects have an important implication for understanding the abnormal behavior of MAM‐rats. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Fetal exposure to cocaine is associated with increased perinatal cardiac risk. Because cocaine promotes adrenergic actions, we assessed the effects of cocaine on development of cardiac adrenergic receptors and cell signaling in the rat. Pregnant rats were given 30 mg/kg s.c. of cocaine from gestational day 8 through 20 and the ontogenetic patterns of adrenergic receptor subtypes and their linkage to control of adenylate cyclase activity were assessed from birth to adulthood. Neonatal overexpression of α2-receptors is required for maintenance of cardiac conduction during the hypoxia associated with birth or sleep apnea, and these receptors were present equally in both control and cocaine-exposed animals; the ontogenetic disappearance of α2-receptors also was unaffected by drug exposure. Similarly, the acquisition of cardiac β- adrenergic receptors, their link to adenylate cyclase activity, and the development of adenylate cyclase catalytic units (assessed with forskolin) remained essentially normal despite fetal cocaine exposure. These results suggest that adverse effects on perinatal cardiac function associated with human maternal cocaine abuse either result from indirect actions of cocaine, such as cell damage caused by hypoxia/ischemia, or alternatively from primary contributions of covariables known to affect cardiac development, such as cigarette smoking.

AB  - Summary: Fetal heart rate (FHR) characteristics of fetuses exposed and not exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were studied. FHR is considered to reflect central nervous system (CNS) integrity. Three intervals during pregnancy were investigated: 20,32, and 38 weeks. At 32 and 38 weeks, FHR was studied in relation to quiet (C1F) and active (C2F) sleep periods. For each tracing, a baseline was determined and accelerations and decelerations were identified. To assess FHR variability, the longterm irregularity, interval difference and absolute beat‐to‐beat indexes, and the bandwidth were calculated for 30‐s intervals between accelerations and decelerations. No marked differences were noted between study and control groups concerning basal FHR and the occurrence of accelerations. For FHR derived from the fetal ECG, all indexes of FHR variability and the bandwidth were lower for the study group as compared with the control group, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. Our study shows that chronic prenatal exposure to AEDs does not seriously interfere with modulation of fetal heart rhythm by the CNS. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) colocalizes within gonadotropin-releasing-hormone (GnRH)-containing neurons in adult hypothalamus and could play a role in the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary axis in adults. To support the possibility that DSIP also partici-pates in fetal neuroendocrine events and to demonstrate the ontogenic evidence of coexist ing neuropeptides, we have performed a detailed immunocytochemical study of DSIP- and GnRH-immunoreactivity in fetal hypothalamus of guinea pig. Using indirect immunofluo- rescent and sequential double-immunolabeling (elution-restaining) techniques, the results indicated that DSIP immunoreactivity was initially detected at the 38th day of gestation. In contrast to the first appearence of GnRH immunoreactivity at day 28, therefore, a 10-day delay was found. Such a delay remains as yet unexplained. From its first occurrence, DSIP immunoreactivity was always labeled with GnRH, whereas some of GnRH-immunoreactive structures did not display a DSIP immunoreactivity. But with the growth of fetus, especially before and after birth, a complete overlap between DSIP and GnRH immunoreactivity was observed throughout various regions of hypothalamus. Attention was also focused on prenatal morphological development of DSIP/GnRH- and GnRH-immunolabeled neurons. Initially, labeled neurons were visualized as uni- or bipolar types. Thereafter, their smooth and irregular subtypes could be distinguished. During later fetal age, relatively mature features were evident such as the increase of multipolar and irregularly labeled neurons. Taken together, these data provide, for the first time, anatomical evidence that DSIP exists in fetal hypothalamus and that, like GnRH, it could regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary axis during ontogenesis. © 1992 S.

AB  - A classic conditioning paradigm was used to examine the hypothesis that perturbations during sleep in the neonate rat can have a lasting impact on breathing. During the first 4 wk of life, stimuli were presented to rats during behaviorally defined sleep. In a conditioned hypoxic (CH) group, brief periods of hypoxic gas were used as the unconditioned stimulus. Tactile and auditory stimuli were used as the conditioned stimuli. In a conditioned control (CC) group, air was used as the unconditioned stimulus. A third group of unconditioned control (UC) rats was not exposed to the conditioning paradigm. Animals were provided routine care for 3.5 mo; ventilation was then assessed using plethysmography. Conditioning during neonatal life produced increased ventilatory irregularities and apnea during behaviorally defined sleep in adult rats. Both CH and CC rats showed a significantly greater number of apneic events compared with UC rats. Over a 2-h sleep period, CH rats exhibited a total of 105.1 ± 9.4 (SE) apneic events, CC rats 69.4 ± 4.2 events, and UC rats 42.1 ± 3.1 events [F(2,18) = 25.568; P < 0.0001]. These findings suggest that experiences in the first few weeks of life will alter ventilatory patterning in the adult animal.

AB  - While many aspects related to the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death remain unclear, the ultimate trigger event appears to be an acute regulatory disturbance of the cardiorespiratory neurons of the reticular formation of the brain stem. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that SIDS often occurs after infection of the upper respiratory tract. We present the case history of a 10-week old infant, where the respiratory pattern demonstrated highly pathological alterations induced by a mild infection of the upper airways, as confirmed by oxycardiorespirography. Oxycardiorespirography provides continuous recording of the respiration (transthoracic impedance) extending over several hours during sleep and during the critical phase just before going to sleep and waking up in relation to heart rate, partial oxygen pressure (measured transcutaneously) and nasal flow. The presented infant is a premature infant delivered in the 34th week of gestation according to Dubowitz (artificial respiration for 7 days due to hyalin membrane syndrome stage II). During infection periodic breathing was found to be 19,3% with partly severe hypoxemia. The longest single episode of apnea was 30 seconds. On the average, 5 episodes of bradycardia occurred (<100/min/measuring hour). An OCRG investigation performed at the age of 5 weeks and after disappearance of the infection at the age of 12 weeks yielded normal findings. This permits the conclusion that in our patient an infection of the upper airways may have induced a pathologic respiratory pattern, which could be a major trigger mechanism for sudden infant death.

AB  - 1. In unanaesthetized fetal sheep (greater than 0.8 term) prolonged anaemia initially reduced the incidences of low‐voltage electrocortical activity, rapid eye movements and breathing activity; but the incidence of each returned to normal within 4‐7 h. 2. Anaemia induced a persistent rise in fetal heart rate and plasma concentrations of adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol. 3. After 16 h the fetal haematocrit was returned to normal. Isocapnic hypoxia induced less than 1 h later also inhibited eye and breathing activity. 4. After 1 h fetal arterial PO2 (Pa,O2) was returned to normal. This rise in O2 tension was associated with an elevation in the incidence of low‐voltage electrocortical activity, eye movements and breathing. Breathing movements also occurred during high‐voltage electrocortical activity. 5. It is concluded that the brain PO2 set‐point for hypoxic inhibition adapts rapidly to alterations in O2‐carrying capacity and is probably due to changes in the concentration and/or receptor affinity of a central neuromodulator. Secondly, a rise in brain PO2 at birth may contribute to the onset of continuous breathing. © 1992 The Physiological Society

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish the time-course of foetal adrenal gland activation by ACTH at a period of intra-uterine development during which adrenal function is minimal (100-120 days of gestation). Blood samples for cortisol analysis were collected at 6-h intervals during the 24 h ACTH (0.05, 0.5 and 5.0 μg/h) infusion and during the subsequent 24-h period following cessation of the infusion. Plasma cortisol concentrations were measured using a newly developed radioimmunoassay, whose sensitivity was found to be comparable to that of the validated double-isotope dilution derivative method. There was a significant increase in foetal plasma cortisol concentration, from 3.9 ± 1 to 17.8 ± 1.9 nmol/l, within 12 h of commencement of the 2 higher doses of ACTH. Values are mean ± SEM; n = 5. Following termination of the infusion, cortisol levels fell significantly by the first 6 h, returning to basal levels thereafter. An increase in plasma ACTH from 4.6 ± 0.6 to 8.4 ± 1.0 pmol/l was sufficient to initiate a significant increase in cortisol production. The results suggest that the normal low values of cortisol at this period of gestation result from inadequate endogenous ACTH production at this stage. © 1992.

AB  - Obstetric anesthesia has been the object of public interest and patient advocacy from its introduction in the 1840s to the present. Early arguments concerned the significance of pain in childbearing and became a popular issue involving physicians, clergymen, and journalists. The first obstetric anesthesia, ether, given in the United States was administered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1847. For the next several decades general anesthesia was the only feasible means of relieving labor pain. At the turn of the century a combination of scopolamine and morphine was introduced in the United States by a popular women's magazine; the National Twilight Sleep Association was launched. After the decline of this movement, the “natural” childbirth method came into national prominence. In spite of their differing pharmacologic characteristics, there are sociologic parallels between the patient advocacy of Twilight Sleep and that of psychoprophylaxis. This study focuses on the public perception of these movements, which were begun by physicians and subsequently endorsed by militant lay groups. © 1992, Mosby. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anna Rose is a survivor of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Much of the abuse was “submerged” until her mid‐thirties, when she was pregnant with her second child, and finally began to remember and deal with the realities of what had happened to her. During her second pregnancy, Anna wrote, “it has taken me more than three years to even begin to deal with the rage I feel about my first birth experience, even though I have been in therapy most of that time. Now that I am pregnant again, the unresolved issues are coming to the surface, and intense fears that this birth will be a repeat of the first.” Anna's first child, Elliot, was born in 1987 in a hospital birthing room in the northeastern United States. Her husband Paul, a younger sister, and a close friend were present, and she was attended by an obstetrician named Bernie. She describes that birth as “19 hours of hard labor, absolutely exhausting and unmanageable, which required drugs at some point to let me sleep for a few hours.” Labor was induced by Pitocin due to premature rupture of membranes and lack of effective contractions after 12 hours. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring was used throughout labor. Anna breastfed Elliot for three years, and found La Leche League “extremely helpful and supportive” during that time. Tom, Anna's second child, was born at home in 1991. Two midwives attended the birth after she changed caregivers during the pregnancy because she “did not feel safe enough” with the obstetrician and nurse‐midwife team she had chosen for this birth. She maintained the team as backup, although they did not know of her plans for a home birth. Her second labor lasted under 6 hours, was noninterventive, and “incredibly intense and painful, partly due to the abuse memories that were coming up and getting in the way and partly due to the baby's position.” We thank Anna Rose for sharing her story with Birth. Her reason for doing so is, in her words, because, “I feel strongly that it is important to share this information in an effort to educate health care professionals so that other women may be helped.” Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - Patient acceptance is a particularly relevant method of assessing currently employed epidural and intravenous techniques of opioid analgesia after elective caesarean section. We have prospectively studied 71 such patients, randomised postoperatively to receive epidural morphine, intravenous morphine or intravenous pethidine. When compared with either intravenous opioid, epidural morphine provided twofold better average or excellent analgesia with 30% less drowsiness but with about 50% more pruritus. In spite of this trouble some complication, more patients (83% vs 74%) preferred epidural to intravenous opioid analgesia.

AB  - Noradrenaline neurotransmission becomes functional early in the development of the brain. Therefore, interference with this transmission by receptor agonists or antagonists, which are used clinically in various conditions in pregnancy, may alter brain development. Long-term biochemical, morphological, behavioural and electrophysiological effects have been reported after pre- or postnatal exposure of rats to adrenergic drugs, the α2-agonist clonidine and the β-antagonist propranolol in particular, and are summarized here.

AB  - The clinical syndrome of a new disease of pigs in four herds in the Humberside area is described. The first signs of the disease were anorexia, lethargy and pyrexia with up to 60 per cent of the dry sows affected. These signs were followed by an increased incidence of abortions which occurred in up to 3.3 per cent of sows, premature farrowings in up to 20.6 per cent of sows and stillbirths and late mummification which affected up to 26.0 and 18.8 per cent of fetuses, respectively. Mortality in neonatal and pre-weaning pigs reached up to 88 per cent and respiratory disease of high morbidity and low mortality occurred in fattening pigs. There were infertility problems in sows, with an increase in returns to service and a failure to show oestrus after weaning or aborting. The signs of the disease in boars were anorexia and malaise. Cyanosis of the extremities affected up to 2 per cent of the animals. The outbreak lasted 11 weeks in all the herds.

AB  - Unlike other pituitary hormones, PRL is under tonic inhibition by the hypothalamus by way of the PRL inhibitory factor, dopamine. GAP and GABA may also be inhibitory. PRL-releasing factors include TRH and VIP and possibly others. Circulating PRL is predominantly monomeric, although some patients with hyperprolactinemia appear to have increased quantities of the less biologically active polymeric forms. PRL is secreted episodically, with an increase in the amplitude of the secretory pulses with sleep. A transitory increase also occurs in response to the protein component of meals. Basal PRL levels increase in response to the hormonal milieu of pregnancy, and suckling postpartum triggers PRL release. Pathologic increases of PRL owing to hypothalamic dysregulation occur with a variety of medications, including the neuroleptics, metoclopramide, antidepressants, methyldopa, reserpine and verapamil, abuse of opiates and cocaine, renal insufficiency, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, neurogenic stimulation, and idiopathically. Hyperprolactinemia also may occur from structural lesions of the stalk and hypothalamus, which cause disinhibition with or without maintenance of PRF activity, ectopic neoplasm production, and, most commonly, from prolactinomas. Diagnostic testing consists of routine chemistry and thyroid testing and imaging with MRI or CT. Dopamine agonists are the freatment of choice of prolactinomas of all sizes. Transsphenoidal surgery is an alternative for the patient who does not respond to medical therapy or who wishes definitive tumor removal, realizing that long-term cure is achieved in only 50% to 60% of patients with microadenomas and a much lower number in those with macroadenomas. Radiotherapy is reserved for patients who do respond to either medical or surgical treatment. Patients wishing to become pregnant usually are treated with bromocriptine, although prepregnancy surgical debulking may be advisable for those with large macroadenomas to reduce problems with tumor enlargement.

AB  - Because infants of substance-abusing mothers (ISAM) have an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome and have abnormal sleeping ventilatory patterns, we studied the effects of mild hypoxia during quiet sleep on ventilatory pattern, heart rate, and arousal in 23 healthy ISAM (mean±SEM: 9.0±0.49 weeks of age) and 15 healthy, similarly aged, control infants. Hypercapnic challenges were performed in six ISAM and eight control subjects. Hypoxic arousal responses were elicited by rapidly decreasing inspired oxygen tension to 80 mm Hg for 3 minutes or until arousal occurred. Failure to arouse to hypoxia occurred in the majority of infants in both groups. All infants had a fall in end-tidal carbon dioxide tension during hypoxia, suggesting that each had a hypoxic ventilatory response. However, the fall in end-tidal carbon dioxide tension was significantly less in the ISAM (mean±SEM: -4.0±0.3 vs -8.0±1.0 mm Hg), suggesting blunted ventilatory responses to hypoxia. Periodic breathing occurred during 9.5% of hypoxic challenges in control infants compared with 37% in ISAM (p=0.056). Heart rates were significantly higher in the ISAM before, during, and after hypoxic challenges. Hypercapnic challenges (inspired carbon dioxide tension of 60 mm Hg for a maximum of 3 minutes) resulted in arousal in all infants: however, ISAM required a significantly longer exposure to hypercapnia before arousal (mean±SEM; 116±7.8 vs 79±13.9 seconds; p<0.02). We conclude that ISAM have an impaired repertoire of protective responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia during sleep, and that this may play a role in their increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome. © 1992 Mosby-Year Book, Inc.

AB  - Mechanisms for the control of episodic fetal breathing movements or the onset of continuous breathing at birth remain unknown. Lung distension with 100% O2 at a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cm H2O may induce arousal and continuous breathing. To investigate 1) the threshold range of arterial oxygen tension (Pao2) for the onset of arousal and breathing and 2) the graded response of breathing to various levels of Pao2, we studied 10 fetal sheep between 135 and 142 d of gestation (term = 147 ± 2 d). Each fetus was instrumented to record sleep states, diaphragmatic electromyogram, arterial pH, and blood gas tensions. Pao2 threshold was determined through an indwelling O2 sensor catheter. Fetal lungs were distended at a continuous positive airway pressure of 40 cm H2O with 100% N2 or with O2 ranging from 40 to 100% via an in situ endotracheal tube. At the onset of arousal (n = 10), Pao2, arterial carbon dioxide tension, and Hb O2 saturation increased from control values of 21.7 ± 0.75 torr (2.9 ± 0.09 kPa), 41.8 ± 1.1 torr (5.47 ± 0.15 kPa), and 52.9 + 2.6% to 65.6 ± 9.6 torr (8.74 ± 1.28 kPa), 46.9 ± 1.3 torr (6.25 ± 0.17 kPa), and 92.9 ± 2.06%, respectively, whereas the pH decreased from 7.31 ± 0.006 to 7.27 ± 0.009 (mean ± SEM; p = 0.001, 0.04, 0.002, and 0.001, respectively). Seven of 10 fetuses breathed continuously. In these fetuses, Pao2 and arterial carbon dioxide tension further increased and pH decreased; however, no further significant increase in Hb O2 saturation was observed. Breathing stopped at a Pao2 of 38.5 ± 9.5 torr (5.1 ±1.3 kPa) but could be restarted by increasing the Pao2. In response to an increase in fetal Pao2 (30-60 torr; 4-8 kPa), amplitude of breathing and total respiratory output significantly increased from the control values. Further increases in Pao2 or Hb O2 saturation did not significantly affect the respiratory output. Hb O2 saturation and arterial pH had the most confounding effects on frequency and amplitude of breathing, respectively. Among the various sleep states, arousal had the most profound effects on respiratory output. We conclude that 1) very high levels of Pao2 are not necessary to initiate arousal and continuous breathing and 2) further increments in Hb O2 saturation above the threshold level have no significant effect on breathing responses. © 1992 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Fetal movements with their associated FHR accelerations, as well as the cyclic alternation between episodes of low and high FHR variability, particularly in late pregnancy, give a clear indication of the fetal rest-activity cycle. FHR vari ability changes during labor indicate that the restactivity cycle continues even though perceived movements may diminish and fetal breathing may stop. Fetal behavioral states, known to be present by term and characterized by the concordant association of fetal movements, continue during labor. However, not all labors show evidence of fetal behavior despite a normal outcome, and the significance of this remains unknown. The influence of the fetal rest-activity cycle on FHR variability is such that recognition of behavioral cycles, when present, is essential for appropriate interpretation of the FHR during labor. © 1992.

AB  - We have examined the effects of prenatal protein malnutrition on interneuronally mediated inhibition and facilitation in the dentate gyrus of the rat using the paired-pulse technique. Field potentials were recorded in the dentate gyrus in response to paired stimuli delivered to the perforant path. The paired-pulse index (PPI) was used as a measure of the net short-term facilitation or interneuronally mediated inhibition effective at the time of the paired-pulse test and was computed by dividing the amplitude of the second population spike (p2) by the amplitude of the first population spike (p1). PPIs were classified according to p1 in order to compare PPIs between behavioral states and dietary treatments since population spike amplitudes in the dentate gyrus vary in relation to behavioral state. Testing was performed during 4 behavioral states: slow-wave sleep (SWS), paradoxical sleep (REM), immobile waking (IW) and exploratory locomotion (AW) using interpulse intervals (IPI) from 20 to 400 ms. The magnitude and duration of interneuronally mediated inhibition was significantly increased in prenatal protein malnourished animals when compared with controls. Paired-pulse tests performed using an IPI of 20 ms under the high p1 (p1>median) condition showed significantly smaller PPIs in prenatal protein malnourished rats regardless of behavioral state. For IPIs greater than 20 ms PPIs were consistently smaller in prenatal protein malnourished rats during SWS and IW. These data indicate that both the magnitude and duration of interneuronally mediated inhibition are increased in prenatally malnourished rats. No consistent diet-related differences were found during AW and REM using IPIs greater than 20 ms because interneuronally mediated inhibition was relatively suppressed during these behavioral states for both dietary groups. There was no consistent behavioral state modulation of paired-pulse facilitation (IPI = 40 to 80 ms) or late inhibition (IPI = 400 ms) in either diet group. In addition, a new relation between PPI and IPI was found under the low p1 (p1>median) condition. During AW the PPIs observed using IPIs of 40 and 50 ms were smaller than those observed using IPIs of 30 and 60 ms. This depression interrupts what is generally considered the "facilitatory" phase of paired-pulse response and may indicate an interaction between perforant path stimulation and hippocampal theta rhythm which is masked when p1 amplitude is high. Possible reasons for increased interneuronally mediated inhibition in the dentate gyrus of prenatally malnourished rats are 1. 1) increased excitability of GABAergic interneurons. 2. 2) reduced capacity for GABA reuptake. 3. 3) altered activity of extrahippocampal modulatory inputs to GABAergic interneurons. Such alterations may also help to explain why prenatally protein malnourished animals demonstrate both resistance to kindling and failure to maintain LTP. © 1992.

AB  - The behavioural response of rat pups, 1-20 days of age, to subcutaneous injection of formalin in a rear paw is described. Formalin-injected pups were compared to handled controls and to pups that received an injection of normal saline. Ongoing behaviour was recorded every 2 min for 60 min after injection. Injection of normal saline produced little disorganization of behaviour, although day-1, -3 and -6 pups did frequently flex the limb on the injected side early in the session. Injection of 10 μl of 1% formalin depressed active and quiet sleep in pups 10 days old and younger. Much less disruption of sleep was observed in day-15 pups, and in day-20 pups it was necessary to increase the concentration of formalin to 2.5% to produce a consistent behavioural response. The specific responses of pups to formalin injection were flexion of the limb, shaking the limb, and licking the injected paw. Pups of all ages displayed all of these responses, but in pups younger than 10 days, only limb flexion was consistent. Shaking became a consistent response in day-10 pups and licking in day-15 and -20 pups. Non-specific behaviours (squirming, vigorous rear kicks with both hind limbs and convulsive whole body jerks) were markedly increased by formalin in younger pups with a developmental pattern: squirming and kicking in day-1 pups, kicking and jerking in day-3 to -15 pups. Non-specific behaviours decreased and specific behaviours increased with age. In addition, the overall intensity and duration of the response decreased with age. The biphasic time course of the response of adult rats to formalin injection did not appear until 15 days of age. © 1992.

AB  - The recognition of factors other than asthma that make asthma worse, are confused with asthma, or occur concurrently with asthma and may or may not interact with asthma is as important as dealing with the asthma itself. In this article I have tried to give an overview of some of these factors: what they are, how they affect patients with asthma, and what to do about them. The recognition of a covert chronic sinusitis, for example, is often key to controlling a person's disease when it appears that everything is being done appropriately. Close attention to these factors will increase the success of treatment of asthma and improve the quality of life of patients.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of the favourite sleeping positions and other possible risk factors for SIDS among infants in a Danish county, and to compare the distribution af sleeping positions with the sleeping positions reported in SIDS-cases from the same district. Information about favourite sleeping positions at the age of one month and four months was collected by interviews with parents, performed consecutively by health visitors at the routine examinations of 174 infants aged eight months. Information about sex, birthweight, gestational age, complications of delivery, mother's age and maternal smoking in pregnancy was collected for each child from the Birth Registration form. Thirty-two SIDS-cases from the 10 year period 1982-91, mostly based on police reports, were analysed retrospectively as regards sleeping positions and other possible risk factors. The distribution of different sleeping positions at the age of one month/four months was: prone 59%/52%, lateral 39%/41%, supine 2%/6%. There was a significant negative correlation between birthweight and use of the prone position. Among the SIDS-cases, the prone sleeping position was reported in 18 of 21 cases (86%), where this information was available. In conclusion, the prone sleeping position seemed to be associated with an increased risk of SIDS (estimated OR 4.1) but some of this difference can be accounted for by the more frequent use of this position among children with low birthweight and other risk factors.

AB  - The pineal gland and melatonin exert a major influence in the control of brain electrical activity and have been shown to be involved in seizure and sleep mechanisms. Since pinealectomy has been reported to result in seizures in experimental animals, it is assumed that melatonin has anticonvulsant properties. Indeed, limited studies in humans with temporal lobe epilepsy indicate that melatonin attenuates seizure activity. In the present communication we present evidence, based on magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain measurements, that melatonin may exert proconvulsive activity in humans as well. The proconvulsive properties of melatonin may explain several phenomena associated with epilepsy such as the increased occurrence of seizures at night when melatonin plasma levels are 5 to 8-fold higher than during the day and the observed exacerbation of seizures premenstrually and during pregnancy as well as the attenuation of seizures in the menopause. Furthermore, our findings suggest that anticonvulsants which decrease melatonin secretion, such as the benzodiazepines, may exert their antiepileptic activity by attenuating nocturnal melatonin secretion. Finally, we propose that patients with nocturnal epilepsy or those experiencing exacerbation of seizures premenstrually may benefit from the administration of agents which block the secretion or action of melatonin. © 1992 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - Synopsis Hydroxyethylrutosides is a standardised mixture of semisynthetic flavonoids, mainly mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrahydroxyethylrutosides, which acts primarily on the microvascular endothelium to reduce hyperpermeability and oedema. In patients with chronic venous insufficiency or diabetes, hydroxyethylrutosides improves microvascular perfusion and microcirculation, and reduces erythrocyte aggregation. The preparation also has a possible protective effect on the vascular endothelium. In short to medium term placebo-controlled studies (up to 6 months) hydroxyethylrutosides therapy improved signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency, including venous insufficiency associated with pregnancy and lymphoedema, and was well tolerated. However, the long term effects of hydroxyethylrutosides administration have yet to be demonstrated. The preparation also alleviated symptoms in patients with severe haemorrhoids, although there were no corresponding objective improvements. Hydroxyethylrutosides administration has been associated with reductions in retinal vascular permeability in patients with diabetic retinopathy but has no apparent effect on signs of retinal haemorrhage, although a reduction in oedema and haemorrhage has been reported in other patients receiving oral hydroxyethylrutosides in the acute phase of central retinal vein occlusion. There are only limited effective pharmacological treatment options for patients with chronic venous insufficiency or lymphoedema, and hydroxyethylrutosides clearly improves signs and symptoms of these disorders. While its role in diabetic retinopathy and haemorrhoids requires some clarification, hydroxyethylrutosides therapy shows promise as a useful additional option for the management of oedema and other symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency. Pharmacological Profile Hydroxyethylrutosides is a standardised mixture of semisynthetic flavonoids, comprised mainly of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrahydroxyethylrutosides. It acts mainly on the microvascular endothelium where it reduces hyperpermeability and oedema. In healthy volunteers, and patients with chronic venous insufficiency, lower limb oedema, idiopathic oedema or diabetic microangiopathy, single doses of hydroxyethylrutosides (0.3 to 1g orally or intravenously) reduce capillary filtration rate. In addition, oral dosages of 1 to 3g daily have improved parameters of microvascular perfusion, including transcutaneous partial oxygen pressure (pO2), and have reduced oedema formation in patients with chronic venous insufficiency. Oral and intravenous administration of 3 g/day decreases microvascular permeability in patients with severe venous hypertension and patients with diabetic microangiopathy. Hydroxyethylrutosides inhibits erythrocyte aggregation in healthy volunteers and preserves erythrocyte deformability in patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement. Hydroxyethylrutosides attenuates nicotine-induced endothelial cell damage in healthy volunteers, and in animals, it has inhibited free radical scavenging. The preparation also appears to have an affinity for vein walls with a possible protective effect against endothelial cell damage and hydroxyl radical formation. There are limited data available on the pharmacokinetic properties of hydroxyethylrutosides in humans and none in special patient groups such as pregnant women, diabetics or elderly patients. Data from studies in healthy volunteers show that the proportion of a dose of hydroxyethylrutosides reaching the systemic circulation is low; about 10% of an orally administered dose is absorbed. In healthy volunteers peak plasma hydroxyethylrutosides concentrations are reached within 1 to 6 hours of oral administration. A maximum plasma concentration of 142 μg/L was reached following a single oral 900mg dose. The plasma elimination half-life ranges from 10 to 25 hours after oral administration and is approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration. The components undergo degradation by intestinal flora to aglycones, although mono-, di- and trihydroxyethylrutosides may undergo hepatic metabolism and are eliminated primarily via the bile. Three to 6% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine. Therapeutic Efficacy In patients with chronic venous insufficiency, hydroxyethylrutosides 0.6 to 1.2 g/day for up to 6 months significantly improves objective and subjective measures of lower limb venous insufficiency. In most placebo-controlled studies the improvements in leg volume, calf and/or ankle circumference, and relief from symptoms of pain, tired legs, night cramps, and restless legs achieved during hydroxyethylrutosides therapy were significantly greater than those reported during placebo therapy. The wearing of supportive elastic hosiery did not appear to affect response. Overall, 73 to 100% of patients had some improvement during hydroxyethylrutosides therapy and 25 to 90% responded to placebo treatment. Response rates (percentage of patients with improvements) for individual symptoms during hydroxyethylrutosides therapy ranged from 54 to 82% for pain, 35 to 55% for restless legs, 64 to 68% for tired ‘heavy’ legs and 59 to 91% for cramps. Improvements in signs and symptoms of venous insufficiency (including cramps, irritation, swelling and pain) and reductions in accumulation of extravascular fluid correlated with improvements in microcirculatory parameters. Reductions in ankle circumference, and improvements in symptoms of pain, night cramps and paraesthesia were achieved in patients with varicosis of pregnancy treated with hydroxyethylrutosides 0.3 to 1.8 g/day. However, effects on the healing rate of leg ulcers have been equivocal. Signs and symptoms of haemorrhoids, including haemorrhoids of pregnancy, have been improved by oral therapy with hydroxyethylrutosides (0.6 to 2g daily for up to 3 to 4 weeks), although in most studies the response of hydroxyethylrutosides-treated patients was significantly greater than that of placebo recipients only in patients with severe symptoms, and objective measures of haemorrhoid severity were not altered. Signs and symptoms of lymphoedema have been alleviated by hydroxyethylrutosides treatment (3 g/day for 6 months), and radiotherapyinduced damage to skin and/or mucosa has also been reduced using concomitant hydroxyethylrutosides therapy (0.6 to 2g daily). In addition, hydroxyethylrutosides has reduced foot swelling rates and reduced retinal vascular permeability of patients with diabetic microangiopathy and retinopathy, respectively, although it does not appear to have any effect on existing retinal haemorrhage in these patients. However, oedema and haemorrhage were reduced in patients receiving oral hydroxyethylrutosides early in the acute phase of central retinal vein occlusion. Clinical Tolerability Administration of hydroxyethylrutosides in clinical trials has generally been well tolerated. The incidence of adverse events reported by patients receiving treatment with hydroxyethylrutosides was similar to that reported by placebo recipients. Gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, dizziness and/or pruritus were the effects most frequently associated with either active or placebo therapy in most studies of patients with chronic venous insufficiency. In studies of patients with haemorrhoids, gastrointestinal disturbances were the most frequently reported adverse events. Hydroxyethylrutosides had no effect on glycaemic control in patients with diabetes. Dosage and Administration The recommended hydroxyethylrutosides dosage is 0.9 to 1.2 g/day orally, for patients with venous insufficiency and those with haemorrhoids, and 3g/day orally, for patients with lymphoedema. A dosage of 1.2 to 2.4g daily has been used in patients with diabetic retinopathy and dosages of 0.6 to 2 g/day have been administered to patients with skin and/or mucosal damage associated with radiotherapy. Hydroxyethylrutosides should not be administered during the first 3 months of pregnancy. © 1992, Adis International Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - To determine whether approximate entropy (ApEn), a new statistic of regularity, when applied to fetal heart rate (FHR) data antepartum or in labor, would offer an advantage over standard statistics of variation in predicting outcome. Methods: A large data base of antepartum FHR records collected in clinical practice over 10 years was available. Two data sets in labor were stored on disk in small computers interfaced to fetal monitors on-line. Outcomes were assessed using blood gas values on delivery and Apgar scores. Results: Antepartum, when the most favorable form of ApEn was used on 769 good-quality FHR records, the correlation with measurement of short-term variation was high. This was especially true when the fetal pulse interval variation fell below the normal range (less than 6 milliseconds short-term; r = 0.93) and in 20 other records with sinusoidal variation (r = 0.96). Approximate entropy varied with fetal sleep cycles and took longer to calculate than FHR variation. During the last hour of labor, in 319 records, there was no significant correlation between umbilical artery base deficit values on delivery and ApEn measurement. In 871 additional good-quality records of fetuses with normal outcome, the mean (± standard error [SE]) ApEn (0.95 ± 0.005) was significantly greater than in 22 records (0.88 ± 0.028) from fetuses with abnormal outcome (umbilical artery base deficit more than 12 mmol/L and Apgar score of 3 or less at 1 minute). However, consideration of the frequency distributions of these measurements showed that ApEn did not discriminate between normal and abnormal outcomes. The SD of fetal pulse intervals rose in labor whereas ApEn values fell, confirming that this new statistic of regularity differs from standard statistics of variation. Conclusion: Approximate entropy offered no advantage over measurement of short-term FHR variation antepartum, and neither measurement predicted outcome in labor. © 1992 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - The general pharmacological effects of felodipine, a novel calcium antagonist, were studied by comparing it with those of nifedipine. Felodipine and nifedipine at a high dose of 100 mg/kg, p.o. decreased the spontaneous motor activity in mice. Felodipine and nifedipine (10-100 mg/kg, p.o.) had little effects on the body temperature, rotarod performance, muscle relaxation, pentetrazole-induced convulsions, reserpine-induced ptosis and tremorine-induced behaviors in various experimental animals. Felodipine and nifedipine (≥10 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently prolonged the hexobarbital sleeping time in mice. These drugs (≥30 mg/kg, p.o.) tended to decrease the duration of tonic extensive convulsion in maximum electro-shock of mice. Felodipine (≥30 mg/kg, p.o.) and nifedipine (100 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased the metamphetamine-induced hypermotility in mice. These drugs (100 mg/kg, p.o.) tended to decrease the avoidance response rate and prolong the latent period of avoidance in rats. Felodipine and nifedipine (1-10 mg/kg, p.o.) induced no abnormal EEG pattern in cats. Both drugs, however, increased the arousal pattern on EEG and decreased slow wave deep sleep. Felodipine and nifedipine (30-100 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced or tended to reduce the acetic acid-induced writhing of mice. At a dose of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg, p.o. felodipine and nifedipine lowered the blood pressure, reduced the heart rate, tended to increase the respiration rate and slightly prolonged Q-T interval in cats. Felodipine (≥10-10 g/ml) and nifedipine (≥10-9 g/ml) inhibited the spontaneous motility on isolated ileum in rabbits. Felodipine (≥10-12 g/ml) and nifedipine (≥10-11 g/ml) antagonized ACh, Hist and BaCl2-induced contraction of isolated ileum in guinea-pigs. Felodipine (≥10-8 g/ml) and nifedipine (≥10-7 g/ml) inhibited the serotonin-induced contraction of isolated rat fundus strip. Felodipine (≥10-9 g/ml) and nifedipine (10-8 g/ml) inhibited the NA-induced contraction of isolated rat vas deferens. Felodipine (10-10-10-9 g/ml) and nifedipine (10-9-10-7 g/ml) inhibited the spontaneous motility of isolated non-pregnant and pregnant uterus in rats. Both drugs (≥1 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited spontaneous motility of both non-pregnant and pregnant rats uterus in situ and inhibited the gastric and intestinal motility of rabbits in situ. Felodipine had no effect on excretion of bile and on the stomach and duodenal mucosa in rats. Felodipine (1-30 mg/kg, p.o.) and nifedipine (3-30 mg/kg, p.o.) suppressed the charcoal transportation of mice and the gastric secretion of rats. Felodipine and nifedipine (30 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) did not affect the contraction of nictitating membrane in cats, the twitch tension of gastrocnemius muscle in rats, the twitch response of isolated rat diaphragm and the corneal reflex in guinea-pigs. In addition, these drugs had no effect on coagulation, osmotic fragility in blood cell, hemolysis and platelet aggregation in rats or rabbits. At a dose of 30 mg/kg, p.o. or more, these drugs increased the level of blood glucose and decreased the serum triglyceride level in rats. Felodipine and nifedipine (≥3 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently decreased the urinary excretion of Na+, K+ and Cl- in saline-loaded rats. Pelodipine (≥10 mg/kg, p.o.) and nifedipine (≥3 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased PSP excretion in rats. Felodipine (3 mg/kg, s.c. x 10 weeks) caused significant decreased in aortic atherosclerosis without reducing hypercholesterolemia in cholesterol-fed rabbits. In conclusion, these effects of felodipine were found to be qualitatively identical with those of nifedipine.

AB  - The general pharmacological profile of 7-fluoro-1-methyl-3-(methylsulfonyl)-4(1H)-quinolone (BTS 53 554, CAS 76568-68-8), the main metabolite of a new vasodilator, flosequinan (BTS 49 465), was investigated. 1. The central nervous system: BTS 53 554 at the dose of 30 mg/kg i.v. caused an increase in respiratory rate and a sedation in general behavior in rats. The drug also inhibited acetic acid-induced writhing and slightly decreased normal body temperature in mice. However, the drug at the doses up to 30 mg/kg i.v. had little effect on the spontaneous movement, hexobarbital-induced hypnosis, reserpine-induced hypothermia and motor coordination in mice. The drug showed neither anticonvulsant nor analgesic actions in mice. Furthermore, it had no effect on the spontaneous EEG, sleep-wakefulness cycle and EEG arousal response in rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg intravenously. 2. The somatic nervous system: BTS 53 554 induced no muscle relaxation in mice and exerted no local anesthetic action in guinea pigs by corneal reflex method. In addition, it had little effect on the neuromuscular transmission in cats. 3. The autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle: BTS 53 554 showed no effect on the sympathetic ganglionic transmission in cats. In isolated smooth muscles, at doses up to 10-3 mol/l it showed little effect on the acetylcholine- or barium chloride-induced contraction of guinea-pig ileum, norepinephrine-induced contraction of rat vas deferens or oxytocin-induced contraction of nonpregnant rat uterus. However, it inhibited non-competitively norepinephrine-induced contraction of isolated rat aorta at 10-4 mol/l or more and serotonin-induced contraction of isolated rat fundus at 3 x 10-4 mol/l or more. In the isolated guinea-pig ileum, the drug slightly inhibited the histamine-induced maximal contraction at 10-3 mol/l. These results suggest BTS 53 554 had no specific effect on norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine or histamine. The drug relaxed isolated guinea-pig trachea at 3 x 10-5 mol/l or more and inhibited the spontaneous movement of isolated pregnant rat uterus at 10-4 mol/l or more, although these actions were extremely weaker than those of isoproterenol (isoprenaline). BTS 53 554 also showed a slight inhibition of uterus movement in anesthetized rats at 30 mg/kg intravenously. 4. The digestive system: BTS 53 554 tended to inhibit the gastrointestinal propulsion in mice and showed a slight inhibition of gastric and intestinal motilities in rats at 10 mg/kg intravenously. In isolated rabbit ileum, the drug slightly inhibited the spontaneous movement at 3 x 10-3 mol/l. For the gastric secretion in rats, BTS 53 554 at 30 mg/kg i.v. tended to inhibit the secretion, however, the drug increased the pancreatic juice secretion in dogs at 3 and 10 mg/kg intravenously. It showed no effect on the bile secretion in dogs. 5. Other properties: BTS 53 554 at 30 mg/kg i.v. decreased the urine volume and urinary excretion of electrolytes (Na+ and Cl-)in rats. However, it had little effect on the carrageenin-induced edema and the blood coagulation system and did not show hemolytic and local irritative actions.

AB  - The term 'secondary hypertension' includes a variety of aetiological processes with no obvious common feature apart, perhaps, from the loss of normal blood pressure regulatory factors. It has been suggested that all forms of secondary hypertension, including renal/renovascular, accelerated phase, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid excess, phaeochromocytoma and toxaemia in pregnancy are associated with the loss of the normal nocturnal fall in blood pressure. The evidence for this view appears strongest for glucocorticoid-induced hypertension, but for most other forms the available data are conflicting and are mostly based on small numbers of patients without adequate control populations. Sleep is a powerful determinant of the nocturnal fall in blood pressure but few studies have addressed the quality of sleep in groups of patients who are often sick and/or hospitalized. Abnormalities in sympathetic drive (e.g. autonomic neuropathy and phaeochromocytoma) can abolish the nocturnal blood pressure reductions, and activation of the sympathetic nervous system may be a critical factor in determining the normal diurnal changes in blood pressure. As approximately 20% of patients with 'essential hypertension' have a blunted fall in nocturnal blood pressure it seems unlikely that ambulatory blood pressure could ever be useful in screening for secondary hypertension.

AB  - Eclampsia and pre-eclampsia are the most important obstetric causes of maternal mortality in the Western world. The current definitions of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy rely on arbitrary blood pressure limits based on intermittent clinic readings which are subject to bias and error. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can overcome many of these deficiencies but has only recently been introduced into antenatal care. Five pregnancy studies using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring are currently underway in Birmingham, Glasgow, Grenoble, Oxford and Dublin. The results so far indicate that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is an acceptable method of measuring blood pressure in pregnancy. It is also concluded that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may have several roles in the future antenatal management of hypertension, including modification of existing classification systems, a clinical confirmatory role and a possible predictive role for pre-eclampsia.

AB  - Pregnant rats were injected with a single dose of methylazoxymethanol (MAM, 25 mg/kg) on gestational days 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 or 19 which resulted in various degrees of microencephaly. Offspring were tested on a two-way shuttle box avoidance and residential maze activity at 60-90 days of age. Rats treated on gestational day 19 (GD19) were severely impaired in the acquisition of the two-way shuttle box task whereas the other groups did not show any significant difference from controls. Spontaneous activity measured for 23 hr in the residential maze was altered as total, time-course and pattern depending on the time of MAM administration: treatment on GD14 prolonged exploratory behavior, treatment on GD15 and GD16 increased nocturnal activity, treatment on GD16 and GD17 induced changes in locomotion patterns and treatment on GD18 and GD19 decreased total activity. These findings indicate that treatment with MAM results in selective deficits in the acquisition of a shuttle box avoidance and alterations of locomotion patterns in the offspring which are dependent on the time of administration.

AB  - Cardio-respiratory physiology in sleep was examined in eight preterm lambs born at 133 - 135 (134 ± 1, mean SEM) days of gestation after 3 - 5 days of pulsatile ACTH/TRH infusion, and contrasted with eight lambs born at term (147 ± 1 days). Lambs were instrumented with electrodes for recording electrocorticogram, electro-oculogram and nuchal electromyogram to define behavioural states, as well as carotid arterial catheters for determination of arterial pressure, heart rate and arterial blood gases. Compared to full-term lambs, the preterm lambs exhibited extended active sleep times, elevated PaCO2 and faster heart rate in all behavioural states than full-term lambs; with increasing postnatal age, sleep times and heart rate declined. As similar differences are found in preterm human infants, the preterm lamb will be a useful model to study the underlying physiology of these cardio-respiratory alterations.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure has a profound effect on the developing brain. In fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), mental retardation and microcephaly are commonly observed. A partial syndrome, fetal alcohol effects (FAE) can result in neurobehavioral sequelae, which may present at birth or appear later in development. This chapter discusses the clinical evidence supporting the concept of FAE, the range of cognitive disturbances seen in FAS and FAE children, and studies on long-term outcome. We review studies that suggest that even in the absence of the stigmata of FAS, neonatal signs of central nervous system dysfunction may predict later developmental deviation. However, the clinical research on the cognitive and behavioral disorders in the FAE population is limited. Examination of electroencephalograms, evoked potentials, and sleep pattern provide additional evidence that the functional integrity of the brain has been altered. An abbreviated review of behavioral animal studies provides additional support for the clinical investigations presented.

AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that fetal plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations vary diurnally, and the mean concentration and the amplitude of the rhythm vary as a function of fetal gestational age. Nine chronically-catheterized fetal sheep were studied between 120 and 142 days' gestation. All of the fetuses were born spontaneously and alive. The pregnant ewes were maintained in a room with a regular light cycle (on at 07.30, off at 17.30). Food and water were available ad libitum. Blood samples were drawn at 4-h intervals throughout a 24-h period. There were no significant daily variations in fetal plasma ACTH, cortisol, or progesterone concentrations, except in the last 3 days of fetal life. In these fetuses ACTH and cortisol concentrations were increased in the afternoon and evening. We conclude that there is no diurnal rhythm in ovine fetal hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, and that the increased plasma concentrations of ACTH and cortisol in the afternoon and evening hours of the last few days of fetal life might be a response to increased uterine contraction activity.

AB  - The association and possible interactions of fetal behavioural state, fetal heart rate and vascular resistance was studied in 23 healthy pregnant women between 36 and 40 weeks' gestation. Doppler flow velocity waveforms were obtained from fetal cerebral (anterior cerebral, internal carotid and basilar), descending aorta and umbilical arteries during fetal behavioural state 1F and repeated during 2F. The Resistance Index (RI) was used as a measure of vascular resistance. Decreased vascular resistance was observed in all vessels except the umbilical artery during fetal behavioural state 2F compared to 1F (P<0.001). A significant interaction was observed between fetal heart rate and fetal behavioural state on the RI of the vessels studied, with a greater negative slope for RI plotted against fetal heart rate in fetal behavioural state 2F (-0.00139) compared to 1F (0.00005) (P<0.001). We conclude that the transition from fetal behavioural state 1F to 2F is associated with a significant reduction in cerebral and systemic vascular resistance, with no apparent change in placental resistance. Furthermore, fetal behavioural state and fetal heart rate interact, demonstrating a stronger association of fetal heart rate and RI in fetal behavioural state 2F in keeping with an increase in baroreflex sensitivity at this time.

AB  - Local cerebral blood flow in four near term fetal sheep was evaluated continuously before and after natural alternations in fetal behavioral state. Measurements were made in fetuses several days following an aseptic surgery to place electrodes for behavioral state recordings as well as heated and reference thermojunctions in cortical and subcortical tissue. These thermojunctions were used to qualitatively assess local cerebral blood flow. The time of transition between rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) was based on visual inspection of strip chart recordings of electrocortical, electroocular, and neck electromyographic activity and application of published criteria for their assessment. To confirm that transition had occurred, the amplitude of the spectrum of the electrocorticogram in one-third octave bands centered around 1 Hz and 20 Hz was measured before and after the transition point. Mean cerebral blood flow rose significantly by 24 s (P < 0.05) after the transition from NREMS to REMS and fell by 12 s after the transition from REMS to NREMS (P < 0.05).

AB  - To assess how REM/NREM periods can be linked to the determination of the REM/NREM sleep and/or awake state, we have investigated the relationship between the REM/NREM periods and penile tumescence in the human fetus. This study was made on 11 male fetuses from 36 to 41 weeks of gestation. Eye movement and penile tumescence were simultaneously examined with an observation window of 60 min, using two separate real-time ultrasound systems. The mean percentage of the total duration of penile tumescence during the REM period and that during the NREM period was 77.7 and 15.8%, respectively. In all cases, the total duration of penile tumescence during the REM period against REM duration was greater than the duration of tumescence during the NREM period against NREM duration with statistical significance. This indicates that the fetal penile tumescence is strongly associated with REM period and the REM period containing penile tumescence in the human fetus can be considered equivalent to REM sleep in utero. In addition, the finding that there exists a part of the REM period lacking penile tumescence suggests the possible origin of the awake state, brought about by advances in fetal development at this stage of gestation.

AB  - The inspiratory times of fetal breathing movements were measured in REM and NREM periods, respectively, and their changes with advancing gestational age were investigated. Ten women without complications in their 20th to 40th week of pregnancy were examined. Fetal breathing movements and REM were observed simultaneously using ultrasonography. REM and NREM periods were selected for analyzing breathing movements separate from the whole examination period. The inspiratory times of fetal breathing movements were measured with the hand-held pressure transducer. The changes in inspiratory time with fetal age showed the same pattern both in REM and NREM periods. There were no significant changes in inspiratory time before 28 weeks gestational age. After that, the inspiratory time lengthened, showing the maximum at 32-35 weeks and then shortened at 36-40 weeks gestational age. There were no differences of the inspiratory time between REM and NREM periods before 32 weeks. After 32 weeks, the inspiratory time in the NREM period was longer than in the REM period. These changes in fetal breathing movements are thought to be caused by the morphological maturation of the fetal lung and the functional development of respiratory and sleep center of the fetal central nervous system.

AB  - The assessment of behavioural activity of the fetus is widely used to assess fetal health in clinical practice as part of the biophysical profile as well as the non-stress test. Considerable information regarding normal activity patterns of healthy human fetuses have been obtained from 24 to 40 weeks gestation. It is this information which has provided the scientific foundation for the development of fetal assessment protocols. Studies in chronically-catheterized fetal sheep have demonstrated that acute hypoxemia leads to an inhibition of fetal breathing movements although prolonged reductions in oxygen delivery to the fetus in the absence of acidemia are associated with adaptation by the fetus and subsequent return to normal incidence of behavioural activity. The behavioural responses of the fetus to specific stimuli including vibroacoustic stimulation have been examined in relation to gestational age as well as type of stimulus. it is proposed that fetal acoustic stimulation could possibly be used to assess fetal neurological function although prior to it being accepted as an universal method for assessing fetal health it is essential that a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in fetal responses to sound and vibration be determined using appropriate experimental techniques.

We have studied the effect of altering the time of darkness during a 12 h photoperiod on the diurnal rhythms of maternal and fetal plasma melatonin and prolactin concentrations and fetal breathing movements (FBMs) in the late pregnant sheep. 2. Four ewes were exposed to a ‘normal’ 12 h light‐12 h dark regime with lights off at 19.00 h. Eight ewes were exposed to an ‘altered’ 12 h light‐12 h dark regime with lights off at 11.00 h. FBMs were recorded continuously and 2 hourly maternal and fetal blood samples taken during 24 h experiments between 120 and 138 days gestation. 3. Plasma melatonin concentrations were higher during the hours of darkness in the ewes and fetuses in both the normal and altered groups; i.e. altering the time of darkness was associated with a shift in the timing of the daily increase in melatonin concentrations in the mother and fetus. 4. In the fetuses, the mean 24 h plasma prolactin concentration was higher in the altered lighting group (28.8 +/‐ 6.1 micrograms/l) compared to the normal lighting group (13.0 +/‐ 3.9 micrograms/l). There was no difference, however, between groups in the daily variation of fetal plasma prolactin concentrations, which were higher at 17.00‐01.00 h than at 05.00‐19.00 h. Thus, altering the time of darkness did not change the timing of the daily plasma prolactin rhythm in the fetus. 5. Under the normal lighting regime maternal plasma prolactin concentrations were higher at 17.00‐19.00 h (i.e. from 2 h before lights off) than at 09.00‐11.00 h. In contrast, under altered lighting, plasma prolactin concentrations were higher at 01.00‐07.00 h (i.e. 2‐8 h after lights on) than at 09.00 h. 6. In the normal lighting group the incidence (min/h) of FBMs were highest at 16.00‐21.00 h and reached a minimum at 05.00‐06.00 h. In contrast, in the altered lighting group the incidence of FBMs was lowest at 19.00‐20.00 h and reached a maximum at 11.00‐12.00 h. 7. The results suggest that the light‐dark cycle influences the diurnal modulation of FBMs, but not the daily variation of fetal plasma prolactin concentrations. The role of plasma melatonin concentrations, and evidence for a photo‐inducible phase of increased prolactin secretion in the fetus, is discussed. © 1991 The Physiological Society

AB  - Male and female Wistar rats were administered a diet containing 450 ppm atrazine as early as 60 days prior to the cohabitation period and the same diet was offered to their offspring. Hexobarbital sleeping time and further in vitro assays pointed to a monooxygenase induction which appeared to be more marked in males vs females and most significant in the offspring at weaning. At this age, induction involved also the cytosolic glutathione S-transferase, a phase II enzyme. Results would suggest that the inducing properties of the herbicide can be transferred to the offspring via the placental and/or the mammary route.

AB  - Until a short time ago, the view prevailed worldwide that children were less sensitive to pain than adults, and such operations as circumcision were performed in babies without adequate anesthesia or analgesia. This view is now considered a misconception, as psychophysiological and behavioral studies show that even neonates have a well-functioning nociceptive system. Nociception generally refers to the neural and sensory aspects of pain, which do not necessarily include conscious experience. There is no discontinuity in the development of the nervous system during birth, and therefore it can be concluded that the fetus is also responsive to noxious stimuli. The question arises as to the stage of ontogeny of the human at which nociceptive behavior begins. Literature on the fetal nervous system reveals that the first signs of somatosensory system function occur at week 7 of gestation and at week 22 the synaptic connection from the nervous periphery to the somatosensory cortex is becoming established. During this period, motor behavior matures, from stereotyped reflexes to spontaneously generated complex motor patterns reminiscent of the repertory of voluntary movement. From week 22 onward the electroencephalogram (EEG) shows increasingly more varied patterns, and sleep-wake states can be discerned after week 30 of gestation. Somatosensory evoked cortial potentials have been recorded from gestational week 28 onward. Substance P, a neuropeptide associated with pain in the adult nervous system, is present in the fetal spinal cord as early as week 12 of gestation, while the antinociceptive opioid peptide enkephalin does not appear until week 24. From week 15 onward, opioid peptides such as β-endorphin appear in the pituitary; their release becomes sensitive to environmental stimuli from about week 20 onward, which can be considered the onset of pituitary stress responses. In particular, parturition and abortion induced the release of opioid peptides. Studies of conditioned behavior show that the fetus has the ability to learn. It has been hypothesized that the fetus and neonate possess a procedural memory, which is not transferred to the language-based memory of later phases of life. Learning and memory are the most essential elements for the construct of "consciousness." Therefore, a primitive type or level of consciousness might exist in the fetus. Thus, a considerable range of sensorimotor function, including memory, develops during fetal life. Anatomical, physiological and behavioral data suggest that the nociceptive system is included in this development. Although we cannot be sure at present whether the fetus consciously experiences pain, beyond the protective nociceptive behavioral responses, anesthesia should be used for invasive procedures to protect the fetus and its nervous systems. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The analgesic profile of epidural nalbuphine for postoperative pain relief and the impact of local anaesthetic choice upon this profile was investigated in 58 patients undergoing elective Caesarean delivery under epidural anaesthesia. Patients were randomized to receive either lidocaine 2% with 1:200,000 epinephrine or 2-chloroprocaine 3% for perioperative anaesthesia, followed by either 10, 20, or 30 mg of epidural nalbuphine administered at the first complaint of postoperative discomfort. Postoperative analgesia was quantitated on a visual analogue (VAS) scale, and by the time from the epidural opioid injection until the first request for supplemental pain medication. The duration of analgesia after lidocaine anaesthesia followed by 10, 20 or 30 mg nalbuphine was 77 (53-127) min, 205 (110-269) min, and 185 (116-241), respectively (median, 95% confidence interval, P < 0.01, 20 and 30 mg vs 10 mg). Following 2-chloroprocaine anaesthesia, VAS remained consistently elevated: the median duration of analgesia was only 30-40 min and did not differ among the three doses of nalbuphine. Side-effects consisted only of somnolence, and were noted only following lidocaine anaesthesia. Somnolence was observed in 0, 20% and 50% of those receiving 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg of nalbuphine respectively (NS). No evidence of respiratory depression was noted in any patient. It is concluded that 20 or 30 mg of epidural nalbuphine provides analgesia for only two to four hours following Caesarean delivery with lidocaine anaesthesia, but anaesthesia with 2-chloroprocaine resulted in minimal or no analgesia from this opioid. Nalbuphine appears to be a disappointing agent for epidural use after Caesarean delivery. © 1991 Canadian Anesthesiologists.

AB  - Relationship between blood flow velocity waveform and fetal behavioral states was studied in 16 normal pregnancies at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation. The peak flow velocity has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction during active sleep, as against that in quite sleep. These data reflect reduced ductal flow and suggest a redistribution in the left-ventricular and right-ventricular output in favor of the left side of the heart during active sleep. In a prospective cross-sectional study of 49 pregnancies (50 fetuses) between 25th and 38th weeks an exponential increase in breathing-related ductal blood flow velocity modulation was observed with advancing gestational age, reflecting the developing pulmonary vascular bed. Fetal ductal flow velocity waveforms were also recorded in 13 cases of prolonged severe oligohydramnios after membrane rupture before 28 weeks' gestation. Normal ductal blood flow velocity modulation values were associated with normal neonatal lung performance, whereas reduced blood flow velocity modulation values were associated with pulmonary hypoplasia. Fetal breathing-related ductal flow velocity modulation appears to be a promising predictor of neonatal lung performance.

AB  - Today, more than ever, women can control their own fertility and dissociate it from long-term intimacy. Among the types of nonmarital fertility, one of the least studied and often most controversial is the phenomenon of childbearing out of wedlock among mature women who are threatened by their own biological clock. It is estimated that there are about 3,000 mature unwed mothers in Israel. No psychological study of this population has so far been undertaken. This article attempts to delineate the demographic characteristics, the reasons for pregnancy, and the moral dilemma of 50 unwed mothers who deliberately decide to give birth as single mothers when they are over the age of 30. © 1991 Human Sciences Press, Inc.

AB  - The effects of two different feeding regimes on the 24 h profiles of maternal and fetal plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) concentrations were studied in eight pregnant ewes between 123 and 144 days of gestation. Once daily‐fed ewes (n = 4) received 1 kg of lucerne‐chaff at 11.00 h, and multi‐fed ewes (n = 4) received 100‐200 g of lucerne‐chaff at 09.00, 11.00 and 13.00 h and then 150 g until 09.00 h the following day. There were significant differences between the two feeding groups in the 24 h profile of maternal plasma osmolality; once daily feeding at 11.00 h was associated with a peak in maternal plasma osmolality at 15.00 h whereas maternal plasma osmolality reached plateau levels at around 17.00 h in the multi‐fed group. There were also differences between the two feeding groups in the 24 h profiles of maternal and fetal plasma glucose. Maternal and fetal plasma glucose reached peak concentrations at 19.00 h in the once daily‐fed ewes in contrast to the multi‐fed group, where a plateau in maternal and fetal plasma glucose was reached between 19.00 h and 09.00 h the following day. A significant diurnal variation in the plasma concentrations of cortisol was present in the once daily‐fed ewes from 123 days gestation and in their fetuses after, but not before, 135 days gestation. Plasma cortisol peaked at 11.00 h in the ewes and at 13.00 h in the fetuses of this group. In the once daily‐fed group there was also a significant diurnal variation in maternal and fetal plasma ACTH; plasma ACTH concentrations were highest at 11.00 h in the ewes aged between 123 and 144 days and in fetuses after 135 days gestation. In the multi‐fed group, whilst ACTH was highest at 09.00 h in the ewes and at 13.00 h in the fetuses, there was no significant diurnal variation in the plasma concentrations of cortisol in the ewes or fetuses of this group at any stage between 123 and 144 days gestation. © 1991 The Physiological Society

AB  - To determine circadian rhythm of steroid levels in normal pregnant women, the following study was undertaken. Concentrations of Cortisol (F), pregnenolone-sulfate (P5-S), DHA, and DHA-S, which are considered to be secreted from adrenal glands, were measured by GC-MS in 9 normal pregnant women at 3 hour intervals through 24 hours. Except for DHA-S, a similar circadian rhythm tendency was observed for each steroid in the first second and third trimesters. The concentrations of F and DHA peaked at 6:00 and the circadian rhythms of both steroids were similar, but P5-S reached a maximum level at 9:00, which was different from F and DHA. DHA-S levels, however, did not fluctuate with a definite circadian rhythm. ACTH was given to normal pregnant women at 12 and 30 weeks of gestation. A significant increment of F and DHA values was observed after administration of ACTH. Although, there was no apparent change of DHA-S in response to ACTH stimulation, low response was observed in P5-S. These results suggest that the adrenocortical steroids measured each has its own circadian rhythm. The secretion patterns of F and DHA from the adrenal gland were similar but different from those of P5-S and DHA-S. Circadian rhythm of steroid concentrations in maternal plasma during pregnancy were demonstrated. © 1991, The Showa University Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the use of a chronic preparation to directly monitor blood pressure and heart rate in pregnant rats, continuous data were obtained over the last half of gestation in normotensive rats. Over this time span, the animals showed significant decreases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate. Heart rate exhibited marked and consistent circadian rhythmicity with peaks occurring near the midportion of the dark phase of the 24-hour cycle. Blood pressure rhythms were less prominent and peaked later. The trends observed in blood pressure and heart rate over gestation suggest that the pregnant rat is a useful model for studying the cardiovascular effects of pregnancy. © 1991.

AB  - Six chronically catheterized rhesus macaques maintained on a 12-hour-light/dark cycle (lights on from 7 am to 7 pm) showed a nocturnal uterine activity rhythm with peak contractile events between 9 and 11 pm (p < 0.05). In blood samples collected at 3-hour intervals over a 24-hour period, we determined that plasma melatonin and progesterone concentrations were elevated at night whereas estradiol, estrone, and cortisol reached peak concentrations in the early morning (p < 0.05). Lights were then left on for the remainder of the study. After 12 days in constant light, daily rhythms in uterine activity and plasma steriod levels were relatively unchanged, whereas melatonin concentrations were suppressed. Animals then received a timed infusion of melatonin (0.2 mg/kg/hr each day from 7 pm to 6 am daily until delivery). The nocturnal uterine activity rhythm and the rhythms in plasma steroid concentrations were maintained. We conclude that the 24-hour patterns in maternal uterine activity and plasma steroid hormone levels are circadian rhythms generate by an endogenous biologic clock and do not appear to be driven by the pattern of melatonin in circulation. © 1991.

AB  - Circadian rhythms in salivary [glucose], [Na+], [K+] and conductivity were measured in 2 age groups of men (men A, 20-45 years and men B, 46-60 years) and 8 different states of fertility in women (normally menstruating, taking oral contraceptives, pregnant, lactational amenorrhea, lactational amenorrhea and taking oral contraceptives, lactating and menstruating, menopausal, and post-menopausal). Unstimulated whole saliva (2-3 ml) was collected every 3 h over a 48 h span. Analysis of Spearman Rank Correlations indicated significant circadian rhythms (significant positive coefficients) for all groups of [Na+] (mean = 0.577 +/- 0.040) and conductivity (mean = 0.410 +/- 0.050). There was no evidence of differences in prominence of rhythm across groups for [Na+] and conductivity. [K+] showed less evidence of rhythms and much greater variability between groups (mean correlation coefficient = 0.198 +/- 0.055). Rhythms in [glucose] (mean correlation coefficient = 0.409 +/- 0.051) were evident in all groups except men B (0.016), menopausal women (0.151) and post-menopausal women (0.310). Model analysis of the data showed no discernible rhythmic trend with age for either conductivity, [Na+] or [K+], where any differences were explainable by the group characteristics. The rhythm in [glucose] showed a significant weakening with age over all groups (F-ratio = 7.46**), and was different between men A and men B (F-ratio = 6.95**). It was concluded that circadian rhythms were present in whole unstimulated saliva for conductivity and [Na+] and that these rhythms were independent of reproductive state, whereas circadian rhythms in [K+] were dependent on reproductive state. Circadian rhythms for [glucose] were dependent on age. The loss of a rhythm in [glucose] with age indicates that glucose, Na+ and K+ are not linked in their entry into saliva. The influence of entry and reabsorption on the final concentrations of glucose, Na+ and K+ in saliva is discussed.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if a skeletal photoperiod administered at the appropriate time of a 24-h day could stimulate prolactin and somatotropin release in dairy cattle. Cows in mo 8 of gestation were exposed to either 12 to 13 h of continuous light or to three skeletal photoperiods consisting of a total of 8 h of light. Cows in the skeletal photoperiod light regimens received 6 h of light from 0500 to 1100 h and a 2-h light pulse at either 1500 to 1700 h, 1800 to 2000 h, or 2100 to 2300 h. Cows exposed to the light regimen pulse at 1800 to 2000 h exhibited a circadian rhythm of prolactin and somatotropin release. The mean prolactin and somatotropin concentrations were also higher in this treatment. It is concluded that a circadian rhythm with a photosensitive phase is present for prolactin and somatotropin release in the lactating dairy cow. The photosensitive phase for both hormones occurs between 13 and 15 h after subjective dawn. The expression of the circadian rhythm of these hormones depends on the photoperiod to which cows are exposed. © 1991, American Dairy Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Twenty very premature babies, born at 24-29 weeks gestation, have been studied while they were maintained in intensive care with continuous intravenous feeding and constant ambient lighting and temperature. Hourly records of insulated skin temperature and heart rate were made for a continuous period of 6-17 weeks, always starting the recording within 24 h of birth. The development of rhythms within the ultradian, circadian and infradian domains was sought by methods including maximum entropy spectral analysis and autocorrelation. Circadian and ultradian rhythms were present, but not regularly so; rather they appeared and disappeared erratically in successive weeks. As a consequence, the group as a whole did not show an increasing rhythmicity with chronological age. In some cases, babies were later placed in a ward in which the lighting was dimmed at night, and feeding by mouth at regular intervals was instituted. There was some evidence for increases in circadian and ultradian rhythmicity after these changes. These results enable inferences to be drawn as to the origin of fetal rhythms in the third trimester of pregnancy, as well as speculation to be made on the ontogeny of ultradian and circadian rhythms in the neonate. © 1991.

AB  - The blood pressure shows circadian variation in normal subjects with higher diurnal than nocturnal values: the difference between day and night time blood pressure is about 10-20 mmHg for systolic and for diastolic blood pressure. These variations are mainly related to physical and/or psychosensorial stress: the physician is himself a cause of increased blood pressure (the 'white coat' effect). The degree of the nocturnal decrease in blood pressure which is maximal 2 and 3 o'clock is related to the quality and depth of sleep. The nocturnal decrease is followed by an increase in blood pressure when the person wakes up (early morning peak). Diagnostic signs: a physiological inversion of the circadian rhythm may be observed in people who sleep during the daytime and work at night. There would seem to be less of a nocturnal fall in black persons in the United States. Some pathological conditions can inverse or at least disturb the circadian variation: apart from hypertension, this has been reported in autonomic nervous system disease, in diabetics with autonomic neuropathy, in some elderly patients, in Cushing's syndrome, after cardiac transplantation, etc... In hypertensives, the lack of nocturnal decrease of the blood pressure or an inversion in circadian rhythm should be looked for in severe and secondary hypertension such as associated with pheochromocytoma, or in renal dialysis patients. In toxaemia of pregnancy, this abnormality may herald an eclamptic crisis. Prognostic signs: in normotensives (especially in black persons) and hypertensives, inversion of the circadian rhythm is associated with more severe left ventricular hypertrophy and a higher morbidity.

AB  - We have investigated the effect of maternal pinealectomy between 104 and 120 days gestation on the daily rhythm in plasma prolactin concentrations in the ewe, foetus and newborn lamb. There was a 24 h prolactin rhythm present in both the intact (n = 4) and pinealectomized (n = 4) ewes. Plasma prolactin concentrations were highest at 2100 h (i.e. 2 h after lights off) and a daily prolactin rhythm was present until at least 24 h before delivery. The mean 24 h foetal plasma concentration of prolactin was significantly higher (P<0.001) in the pinealectomized (35.3 + 1.9 μg/1) than in the intact group (6.9 ± 0.6 μg/1). There was a significant 24 h rhythm in foetal prolactin concentrations and the timing of the daily peak (2100 h) was the same in the foetuses of intact and pinealectomized ewes. During the first 10 weeks after birth there was a significant effect of time of day on prolactin concentrations but the 24 h prolactin profile was significantly different in the lambs delivered to pinealectomized ewes than in the lambs delivered to intact ewes. In the lambs delivered after maternal pinealectomy, plasma prolactin concentrations were higher between 1900 and 2300 h than between 0700 and 1100 h, whereas in lambs delivered to intact ewes, prolactin concentrations were higher at 0100 h than between 1500 and 1700 h. We conclude that the ontogenesis of the daily rhythm in foetal and newborn lamb plasma prolactin concentrations is not dependent on a daily melatonin signal from the ewe.

AB  - A typical diurnal variation in blood pressure is observed in patients with essential hypertension. Attenuation or lack of circadian periodicity might be expected in patients with secondary hypertension. Therefore, non invasive ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring was performed in 172 patients with secondary hypertension and in 201 patients with essential hypertension. The following patients with secondary hypertension were investigated: renoparenchymatous nephropathy (n = 29), diabetic nephropathy (n = 24), morbus Conn (n = 6), renal artery stenosis (n = 32), pheochromocytoma (n = 5), hemodialysis patients (n = 30), and patients after kidney transplantation (n = 44). In addition, 36 pregnant women (17 normotensives, 19 hypertensives) were studied. 98.5% of patients with essential hypertension showed a nightly decline in blood pressure of at least 15 mmHg (systolic + diastolic), whereas 70% of patients with secondary hypertension showed either an attenuated circadian rhythm or no circadian rhythm. Patients with pheochromocytoma who had a nighttime increase in blood pressure demonstrated the greastest difference in the essential hypertension collective, followed by patients with diabetic nephropathy and patients after kidney transplantation. After successful treatment of the condition leading to hypertension, circadian periodicity returned in some patients. In summary, these results suggest that the absence of a nighttime decline in blood pressure during 24-h-ambulatory monitoring is an indication of secondary hypertension, which should be further investigated. As a practical consequence, antihypertensive drugs should also be applied in an evening dose in secondary hypertensives. Noninvasive ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring is recommended for treatment control, especially in patients who need an efficient blood-pressure control.

AB  - The nocturnal spontaneous locomotor behavior of vitamin B-6 restricted and control rats was measured using activity chambers. The results show a generalized hypoactivity in indices of horizontal and vertical activity in neonatal rats fed vitamin B-6 restricted diets during gestation and lactation. This pattern of locomotor behavior changed in the postweaning period to a gradual increase in indices of locomotor activity to a pronounced hyperkinesis in vitamin B-6 restricted young adult rats. This study suggests that long-term vitamin B-6 restriction results in damage and/or abnormal development of neuronal system(s) associated with locomotor behavior. © 1991.

AB  - Serum melatonin concentrations from 55 pregnant healthy women (13 during the first, 18 during the second and 24 during the third trimester) and 11 non-pregnant control women were measured radioimmunologically at 11.00 h (Study A). In addition, serum melatonin concentrations from 12 women in early and 11 women in late pregnancy were measured every four hours throughout the day (Study B). Serum melatonin levels during the third trimester of pregnancy (76.5 ± 38.3 pmol/l) were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those during the first (29.7 ± 9.9 pmol/l) and the second trimester (39.1 ± 11.2 pmol/l) and those of non-pregnant control women (41.7 ± 15.5 pmol/l) and there was a positive correlation between the week of gestation and serum melatonin at 11.00 h (Study A). A clear diurnal rhythm in serum melatonin concentrations was found both in early and in late pregnancy (Study B). The amplitude and duration of the nocturnal rise of melatonin were higher during late pregnancy, but there was no clear phase shift. Increased serum concentration of melatonin in late pregnancy may be due to increased synthesis and secretion or retarded metabolism of melatonin during late pregnancy.

AB  - Thyroid function was investigated during and after pregnancy in 12 healthy euthyroid women. During pregnancy, serum total T<inf>4</inf> (TT<inf>4</inf>) levels were significantly elevated and nearly stable, while thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels progressively increased till the 7th month. A slight elevation, though not significant, of free T<inf>4</inf> (fT<inf>4</inf>) was recorded in early pregnancy. In the following months, fT<inf>4</inf>, free T<inf>3</inf> (fT<inf>3</inf>) and the T<inf>4</inf>/TBG ratio progressively diminished, reaching a plateau at the 7th month. Serum TSH levels, measured by an ultrasensitive immunofluorometric assay, were comparable to postpartum values during the first trimester and showed a moderate upward trend with the progression of pregnancy. The evaluation of 24-hour TSH profiles was performed in 5 women during the first trimester of pregnancy. In all women, the circadian rhythm of TSH was present with a normal nocturnal surge, though anticipated in 1 case. In summary (1) during the first trimester of pregnancy, the increased thyroid activity does not seem to be only sustained by pituitary TSH which remains unmodified; the negative correlation between TSH and hCG levels might suggest that hCG also stimulates the gland to increase thyroid hormone output, and the presence of a normal TSH circadian rhythm indicates that the central mechanism of neuroregulation of the pituitary-thyroid axis is preserved in early pregnancy, and (2) in late pregnancy, a marked decrease in free thyroid hormone fractions is accompanied by serum TSH levels still in the normal range, indicating a modification of thyroid homeostasis which might recognize various etiological factors. © 1991 S.

The intracardiac, umbilical arterial and uterine arterial waveforms were recorded in 24 normal pregnancies, ranging from 18 to 30 weeks gestational age. Studies were performed at 10 a.m., 1-2 p.m. and 4-5 p.m. Analysis of variance showed no significant change in combined cardiac output, or in uterine or umbilical blood flow velocities in this gestational age range, between the three times of the day. © 1991 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - The 24-h pattern of oxytocin (OT) concentrations in maternal plasma was investigated serially from 112-168 days gestation in four chair-restrained pregnant rhesus monkeys. No change in the mean daily plasma OT concentration was observed with advancing gestational age; there was a change in the pattern of plasma OT secretion throughout the period, however. About 21 days from delivery (150.8 ± 1.8 days gestational age), plasma OT levels showed occasional fluctuations, distributed throughout the day. About 8 days from delivery (163.2 ± 2.4 days gestational age), a clear circadian pattern of OT was detected, with an acrophase at 2200 h. These results suggest that there is a relationship between the pattern of OT secretion and advancing pregnancy. This may account partially for the increase in uterine activity known to occur in term rhesus monkeys. © 1991 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Eighty-nine black women without major medical risks for preterm labor participated in this longitudinal, prospective study for the evaluation of usual prelabor uterine activity and for the assessment of how gestational age, time of day, maternal weight, age, and parity affected contraction frequency. Participants wore an ambulatory tocodynamometer for 72 consecutive hours at three points in gestation during the second and early third trimesters while engaged in usual home and work activity. Data obtained from the 81 women with uncomplicated term pregnancies demonstrated a significant increase in contraction frequency with advancing gestational age between 22 and 33 weeks. After 26 weeks, significantly more uterine activity occurred at night. Perhaps because of detection difficulties, contraction frequency was inversely related to maternal weight in women weighing > 112% ideal weight. Maternal age and parity did not affect contraction frequency. Contraction characteristics of eight women experiencing preterm labor or medically indicated preterm delivery are described. © 1991, Mosby. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fetal heart rate variation in early labor was measured by computerized analysis in cyclic episodes of low or high variation in 136 women at 37 to 42 weeks' gestation. The amplitude (mean ± SE) in episodes of low variation was 20.6 ± 0.4 milliseconds; in high variation it was 57.3 ± 1.1 milliseconds. The duration (mean ± SE) of low episodes (24.3 ± 1.3 minutes) was less than that of high episodes (45.1 ± 2.7 minutes) but was sometimes >1 hour. In episodes of low variation the amplitude was <5 beats/min long term in 11% and <2.5 milliseconds (pulse intervals) short term in 8%; these measures would be predictive of intrauterine death if persistent before birth. We conclude that the use of decreased fetal heart rate variation as a diagnostic sign of acute fetal hypoxemia in labor is incorrect, because changes of this size occur randomly as a consequence of fetal sleep states. There was no significant correlation between fetal heart rate variation over the last hour of labor and umbilical arterial base deficit on delivery. © 1991.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine whether there were circadian variations in serum osteocalcin in normal horses and to determine whether it was important to regulate the time of blood sampling in clinical investigations. Osteocalcin or bone Gla-protein (BGP), alkaline phosphatase, total calcium, phosphate and total protein were studied over a 24 h period. Blood samples were taken every 60 min from nine adult Standardbred horses. There was a correlation between serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (r = 0.3, p less than 0.01), phosphate (r = 0.42, p less than 0.01) and serum osteocalcin levels. There was a very marked individual effect on serum levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase (p less than 0.01). This effect was present for phosphate levels but not significant for total calcium. The individual effect was lower and time effect was higher for serum osteocalcin if the subjects were divided into two age groups, one of horses of five years or less (n = 4) and a second group older than five years (n = 5). In both groups a circadian rhythmicity was observed. Serum osteocalcin showed a biphasic pattern. Levels were constant during daytime (light period) and underwent significant variations during the night (dark period), going through a nadir at 2000 h and through a maximum peak at 0500 h. It was concluded that in normal horses the blood osteocalcin level follows a circadian variation. Also daytime (light period) seems to be the more appropriate period for blood sampling.

AB  - Changes in 24-h synchronized (circadian) characteristics of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HP) are quantified in two consecutive pregnancies of a clinically healthy woman. BP and HR were automatically monitored, with few interruptions, at 1-h intervals, and for a total of 76 days of monitoring in each pregnancy. Circadian parameters of BP and HR were computed for each single day of measurements by the least-squares fit of a 24-h cosine curve. Regression analysis of parameters thus obtained revealed patterns of variation of circadian rhythm-adjusted means and amplitudes with gestational age. This longitudinal study confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday-life conditions the predictable pregnancy-associated variability in BP and HR, and also allows the establishment of prediction and confidence limits for cardiovascular parameters in a healthy pregnancy.

AB  - Continuous administration of a GnRH agonist (GnRH-Ag) at a dose of 5 μg/day, commencing on day 7 of pregnancy resulted in the suppression of daily nocturnal surges of prolactin (PRL) on day 8, and serum progesterone (P4) levels with subsequent termination of pregnancy. Replacement with dydrogesterone, a synthetic analog of P4 at a dose of 4 mg/day s.c. restored the magnitude of nocturnal PRL surges. These data suggest that GnRH-Ag may act either at the level of the brain to suppress the nocturnal PRL surge, resulting in a fall in serum P4 levels or at the level of the corpus luteum itself or at both sites simultaneously to terminate pregnancy. © 1991.

AB  - The distribution of the duration of labor during the day was analyzed. Material A one‐year material consisting of 1,881 deliveries at the Department of Obstetrics, Regional Hospital of Trondheim, Norway. Only singleton pregnancies with spontaneous onset of contractions and intended vaginal delivery were included. Duration of labor was routinely recorded by the midwife. Methods Stepwise multiple regression. Logarithmic transformation of the dependant variable (duration measured in hours) was applied. Parity (0/1±) and hour of birth were the independent variables. This reflects a clustering of cases with longer duration of labor, unfavourable progress and less good prognosis during the latter half of the day, which has practical implications for the obstetrical staff. This may explain the similiar circadian pattern in perinatal mortality which has been repeatedly documented, the etiology of which has remained enigmatic. 1991 Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand

AB  - A 24-h rhythm has been demonstrated in fetal and maternal melatonin plasma concentrations in pregnant sheep in the last third of gestation. Melatonin in the maternal circulation can cross the placenta and is the major source of melatonin in the fetal circulation. Melatonin has been postulated to act as a prostaglandin (PG) synthetase inhibitor in the uterus. PG synthetase inhibitors decrease myometrial contractility. To assess transplacental passage of melatonin and potential influences of melatonin on uterine contractility, we infused melatonin continuously into the maternal jugular vein in seven pregnant sheep at 138-142 days gestation (term in our instrumented animals is 147 days gestation) at three infusion rates for successive 1-h periods during the late morning to late afternoon. There was no change in the total time during which the myometrium was active, as indicated by myometrial electromyographic activity or the myometrial contracture frequency during the 3 h before and after melatonin infusions and for each hour of the infusions.The MCR for melatonin in the ewe was 4128 ± 410 ml/min (mean ± SE; n = 7; weight, 50-70 kg). The resting maternal to fetal melatoninconcentration ratio was 0.8; this ratio was maintained at 2.28 during melatonin infusion to the ewe at a wide range of maternal melatonin concentrations. Melatonin concentrations in the range of 3-200 times normal had no effect on the maternal plasma PGF2a metabolite concentration, but caused a 40.4% fall in fetal plasma PGE2 (P < 0.05). We conclude that changes in maternal and fetal plasma melatonin concentrations within the physiological range observed throughout the day do not alter myometrial contractility, but do alter fetal PGs. © 1991 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The serum concentration of corticosterone was examined in control and stressed pregnant female mice (Mus domesticus) as well as male and female fetuses due to our interest in the behavioral effects of material stress on offspring in mice. Pregnant females were restrained under flood lights (2 sessions/day, 45 min/session) from Day 13-17 of pregnancy. On Day 17 of pregnancy a significant increase in maternal serum corticosterone was exhibited 1 h after the onset of a stress session, and serum corticosterone did not return to baseline until 16 h later. We also observed a significant increase in serum corticosterone in male fetuses during the first 4 h after maternal stress, while no significant change in serum concentration of corticosterone was observed in female fetuses throughout 24 h after maternal stress. Daily variation in serum concentration of corticosterone was also determined at 4-h intervals in pregnant mice and their fetuses from Day 16-18 of pregnancy. Pregnant females maintained on a 12 L:12 D cycle exhibited peak serum corticosterone concentrations at and just before the onset of the darkness. Daily fluctuations in serum concentrations of corticosterone in male and female fetuses reflected the pattern observed in the mothers. A sex difference in serum corticosterone in fetuses was observed at some, but not all times of the day, with the difference being greatest during the dark phase of the mother's light:dark cycle. © 1991.

AB  - This retrospective study involving 3,896 births is performed to see if there is any association between time of delivery and feto-maternal outcome. 34 pc of all deliveries occurred in the four-hour period 2000 hours to 2400 hours. Generally, there were more unbooked women arriving during the night. The higher caesarean section rate during the day time is probably related to the number of elective procedures performed during this time. This study, however, failed to confirm others which demonstrate a poorer outcome during the night infant outcome, in fact tended to be worse during the period 0800 hours to 2000 hours, and this was particularly so for the women delivering between 1600 and 2000 hours. Implications for reorganisation of the mid-wifery staff are discussed.

AB  - The maternal transfer of circadian rhythmicity and photoperiodic information to the fetus has been clearly demonstrated in several species, as has the importance of the pineal hormone, melatonin, in conveying this information. Maternal melatonin is known to readily cross the placenta and be taken up by the fetal brain. Specific melatonin receptors have been demonstrated in the rodent brain and pituitary from the 21st day of gestation. To better understand the mechanisms by which melatonin brings about the transfer of information to the fetus and to define the receptivity of the fetus to the melatonin signal, we have followed the ontogeny of central melatonin binding sites in the rat from the 13th day of gestation to 5 days after birth. The use of in vitro autoradiography allows for the precise localization of binding sites as well as their quantification. In the present study melatonin binding sites were first found on the 15th day of gestation, at which time specific binding was limited to the pituitary. At birth it was possible to identify a strong label in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary, whereas the pars distalis appeared to be less intensely and more unevenly labeled. Neuronal melatonin binding sites became apparent from day 17 of gestation in an area of the dorsal brain that in older fetuses and in neonatal rats appeared to be the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. Moreover, melatonin binding sites are identifiable over the suprachiasmatic nuclei from day 18 of gestation. These data show that the fetal pituitary may have the potential to respond to the maternal melatonin signal as early as the 15th day of gestation, and that the brain may attain that potential at the 17th or 18th day of gestation. © 1991 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Daily (9 am and 6 pm) blood samples were obtained from the inferior vena cava during the last trimester of pregnancy in a tethered baboon model. In addition, three 24-hour (hourly blood sampling) studies were performed at days 143 to 147, 158 to 162, and 172 to 177 of pregnancy. Dramatic 24-hour rhythms in progesterone and estradiol were detected, with both steroids surging nocturnally. Early in the third trimester the estradiol surge followed the progesterone surge. However, approximately 10 to 12 days before delivery, the initiation of the nocturnal estradiol surge shifted forward, thus preceding the progesterone surge. This forward shift in the estradiol surge created a daily (3 to 5 hours) window of elevated estradiol-to-progesterone ratio and appears to coincide with the initiation of nocturnal uterine contractions. The nocturnal uterine contractions can be inhibited by an oxytocin antagonist. We hypothesize that this forward shift in the initiation of the estradiol surge induces nocturnal uterine contractions by oxytocin release and/or increase in uterine oxytocin receptors and generates molecular messages that are the genesis for labor and delivery in the baboon. © 1991, Mosby.

AB  - The posterior pituitary gland contains a potent PRL-releasing factor (PRF). The aim of this study was to determine whether this PRF was involved in the luteotropic PRL surges of early pregnancy. The posterior pituitary was removed from a group of rats at least 4 weeks before the experiment (LOBEX). LOBEX rats were tested for diabetes insipidus and checked postmortem for the absence of posterior lobes. Plasma samples were taken from these chronically LOBEX rats as well as from sham-operated and unoperated controls beginning at noon on day 3 of pregnancy and continuing for 3 days at times most likely to demonstrate the twice daily surges of PRL secretion.PRL in all srrouns was hasal (<12 ng/ml) at noon rose to a diurnal peak at 1800 h. While the unoperated and sham- operated controls then displayed a clear nocturnal surge of PRL, peaking at 300-400 ng/ml at 0300 h, LOBEX rats had a significantly attenuated peak of 102.7 ± 17.7 ng/ml (P < 0.001). On subsequent nights the nocturnal peaks were similarly attenuated in LOBEX rats, averaging 80.3 and 42.1 ng/ml on days 5 and 6, respectively. LOBEX rats all had normal sized litters, but lactation yields were depressed.These data support the hypothesis that the posterior pituitary secretes a potent PRL-releasing factor because its removal partially blocked the mating-induced nocturnal surge of PRL. © 1991 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The plant compound, 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (6-MBOA), is found in the meristematic tissue of young, vegetatively growing grasses, and its ingestion stimulates the reproductive system of rodents in both short and long photoperiods. The present study demonstrates the existence of a novel mechanism whereby the presence of 6-MBOA in the diet of pregnant prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) enhances gonadal development in their male offspring. Female voles were fed specially milled food in which 6-MBOA was present (50 μg of 6-MBOA/g food) or absent (0 μg of 6-MBOA/g food) prior to the birth of their young; all of these dams received a diet that lacked 6-MBOA after the pups were born. Other females were fed food without 6-MBOA throughout pregnancy, but received one of the two diets during lactation. The pups from all experimental groups were weaned at 3 weeks of age and fed thereafter one of the two diets for 3 additional weeks. Prenatal exposure to 6-MBOA enhanced male reproductive development. Maternal ingestion of 6-MBOA during lactation or postweaning intake of 6-MBOA by the young did not influence reproductive development of males. This mechanism may be involved in the rapid rate of sexual maturation observed prior to peak population densities of microtine rodents. © 1991.

AB  - Conflicting indirect data exist as to whether diurnal variations occur in fetal urine flow rate. In addition, the extent of diurnal rhythms in fetal venous pressure or arterial pressure is unknown, although 24-h rhythms do exist in fetal heart rate. In the present study, we used on-line computer techniques to continuously monitor these variables in chronically catheterized ovine fetuses. Fetal urine flow rate and vascular pressures were successfully recorded in 6 of 11 animals over a 24-h period on 21 days out of a total of 45 days of monitoring. We found highly significant diurnal variations in fetal urine flow rate (P &lt; 10-6). Hourly means displayed a maximum at 2130 h and a minimum at 1330 h with a maximum amplitude of 28 ± 5% of the 24-h mean. A secondary maximum (at 0630 h) and minimum (at 0330 h) of smaller amplitude also occurred. There were simultaneous and highly significant (P &lt; 0.0001) diurnal rhythms in fetal arterial pressure (±2%), venous pressure (±7%), and heart rate (±5%). The maxima in arterial pressure and heart rate occurred within 1h of the maximum in urine flow, while venous pressure changes were opposite those in arterial pressure. Hourly mean urine flow correlated significantly with arterial pressure but not venous pressure or heart rate, suggesting that the observed 24-h variations in fetal urine flow rate may be partially mediated by a pressure diuresis. Thus the present study suggests that there are highly significant but low amplitude 24-h rhythms in venous pressure, arterial pressure, and heart rate concomitant with high amplitude 24-h rhythms in urine flow rate in the late gestation ovine fetus.

AB  - The diurnal variation of folate concentrations in mouse plasma and embryo between day 8.5 and day 9.5 of gestation (light cycle = 0900-2100) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Folate concentrations in the embryo were high during the evening hours, decreased during the night, reached their lowest levels at 0500, and then increased again during the day. High levels of folates may be related to increased food intake by the pregnant mice. Small changes of the two major maternal plasma folate metabolites were observed. The relative amount of each folate metabolite in the embryo, as compared to the total folate concentration, remained in a narrow range. The main metabolites were tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) (32.4% ± 2.1% of total folates), 5-CHO-THF (24.2% ± 2.3%), and 10-CHO-THF (17.0% ± 1.9%). A dramatic alteration of these ratios occurred only between 1100 and 1400. The relative content of THF increased (52.7% ± 2.5%), whereas the relative concentration of 5-CHO-THF in the embryo decreased (6.5% ± 1.9%). Before 1000 when the ratios of folate metabolites were stable, the rate of valproic acid-induced neural tube defects was reduced from 49% of living fetuses to 12% by coapplication of folinic acid via subcutaneously implanted minipumps. During the period in which dramatic changes in ratios between the folate metabolites in the embryo occured, no protective effect of folinic acid on volproic acid-induced exencephaly could be observed. Our results indicate that the diurnal variation of folate metabolism in the embryo is important in regard to valproic acid teratogenesis and its protection by folate supplementation. © 1991.

AB  - Transvaginal ultrasonography with colour flow mapping has been used to study changes in intra-follicular morphology and blood flow during a pen-ovulatory period in one volunteer. Aspects of uterine morphology and blood flow were also recorded. The intervals from a defined luteinizing hormone (L rise and peak to the mean time of follicular rupture were 37.5 and 17.5 h, respectively. Blood flow velocity waveforms were observed clearly at the time of the LH rise and blood vessels were visible when the hormone level reached a peak. Concurrently, the wall of the follicle became less clear, crenated, thicker and more echogenic. A structure resembling the detached cumulus and oocyte was seen before the follide had ruptured. Peak systolic blood velocity was highest immediately after ovulation had occurred. Blood flow impedance In the uterine arteries suggested the presence of a circadian rhythm, but no pronounced daily changes were observed over the study period. In contrast, flow velocity waveforms were clearly visible in the endometnium around the time of ovulation. These preliminary data suggest that Intra-follicular vascularization or angiogenesis may be critical processes that might be used to predict ovulation and could possibly be modified to help achieve or avoid a pregnancy. © 1991 Oxford University Press.

AB  - Pregnant rhesus monkeys exhibit diurnal changes in uterine activity (UA), with episodes of increased UA during the early hours of darkness. The estrogenic environment during late pregnancy serves a permissive role in the maintenance of nocturnal UA episodes and may involve myometrial interactions with oxytocin (OT) and/or α-adrenergic stimuli. In the present study we have used chronically catheterized pregnant rhesus monkeys to measure diurnal changes in maternal plasma OT, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. We also determined the effects of infusing an OT antagonist (ORF 22164) and the a-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine on nocturnal UA episodes. Animals were exposed to a 16-h light, 8-h dark photoperiod, with the hours of darkness between 2300–0700 h. Maternal plasma samples were collected at 3-h intervals for 36 h and analyzed by RIA for OT and by high performance liquid chromatography for catecholamines. Plasma OT was correlated with UA in animals that displayed nocturnal UA episodes (r = 0.76; P < 0.01). Maximal OT concentrations occurred at 2400 h in these animals; plasma OT was higher during the hours of darkness compared to levels during the light phase (10.4 ± 1.9 and 3.0 ± 0.3 pmol/L, respectively; n = 4). Some animals did not display nocturnal episodes of increased UA and showed no increase in OT concentrations during the hours of darkness. Maternal plasma catecholamine concentrations were not correlated with nocturnal UA and were maximal during the light phase. Nocturnal UA was abolished within 30 min of infusion of the OT antagonist, but phentolamine infusions had no effect on nocturnal UA. We conclude that 1) changes in maternal plasma catecholamine concentrations are not involved in the generation of nocturnal UA; 2) the presence of episodes of increased UA at night results from increased maternal plasma OT concentrations; and 3) the absence of nocturnal UA in some animals can be explained by a reduced level of OT secretion. © 1991 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - We have demonstrated previously that the administration of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) decreases plasma progesterone levels within 24 h and thus, results in abortion during the first half of pregnancy (Am. J. Physiol. 241 (1981) E444-E448). The purpose of this study was to determine (a) if the administration of DHT suppresses plasma prolactin levels or its nocturnal surge within 24 h after the treatment, (b) how soon after the commencement of treatment do the concentrations of DHT increase and progesterone levels decrease in the circulation, (c) the ultrastructural changes that occur in corpora lutea, and (d) the changes in luteal P-450 side-chain cleavage (P-450SCC) enzyme and mRNA content upon DHT treatment. Within 24 h after the commencement of DHT treatment, the nocturnal surge of prolactin, detected in both groups on day 10 at 03.30 h, was inhibited in DHT-treated rats as compared to controls. The non-surge levels of prolactin at 05.00 and 06.00 h were not different between groups. The intraovarian DHT pellet increased plasma levels of the steroid 3-fold within 2 h (blood samples were taken at 2-hourly intervals) when compared to controls. By 24 h DHT levels were decreased but were still higher than controls. Plasma progesterone levels began to fall 6 h after the commencement of treatment. Luteal tissue from animals treated with DHT appeared steroidogenic, and contained more lipid droplets than controls. No changes in mitochondrial structure or number were observed. Although the amount of luteal P-450SCC mRNA was lower in the DHT-treated rats compared to control rats, this decrease was not associated with a decline in P-450scc protein content within 24 h after DHT treatment. These data suggest that exogenous administration of DHT in pregnant rats results in acute high levels of plasma DHT leading to decreased plasma progesterone levels. The decline in plasma progesterone may be due to decreased cholesterol transport to the mitochondria or to decreased esterase activity. The lower progesterone levels, in turn, may lead to inhibition of the nocturnal prolactin surge. This study provides new information and insight into the abortifacient mechanism of DHT. © 1991.

AB  - Endogenous opioids stimulate PRL release in the rat during proestrus, stress, and lactation. This study investigated the potential role of opioids in regulating the daily nocturnal PRL surges that occur during the first half of pregnancy. On day 8 of pregnancy, infusion of naloxone (NAL; 0.25, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/10 min), an opioid receptor antagonist, from 0100-0400 h blocked the nocturnal surge in a dose-dependent manner. PRL remained at basal levels throughout the infusion when the highest dose of NAL was used. A PRL surge was still present in this group, but its delayed onset occurred 1 h after termination of the NAL infusion. In another experiment NAL was used to determine whether opioids are needed to maintain the nocturnal surge or only to initiate the surge. On day 8 of pregnancy, infusion of NAL (2.0 mg/10 min) was started at 0300 h, after initiation of the surge had occurred, and was continued until 0600 h. After 1 h of infusion, PRL levels were less than 20 ng/ ml, compared to more than 200 ng/ml in controls (P < 0.002) and remained low. A PRL surge occurred approximately 2-3 h after the infusion was discontinued, at a time when the surge was completed in controls (P < 0.01). Experimental animals did not differ in their surges relative to controls on the next day when no infusion was given. Another set of experiments was performed to determine whether blockade of endogenous opioids inhibited the nocturnal PRL surge by stimulating tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons. Day 8 pregnant rats infused with NAL (2.0 mg/10 min) from 0100-0400 h demonstrated no nocturnal PRL surge. Subsequently, the medial basal hypothalamus in NAL-treated animals and saline controls was incubated in vitro with the DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor brocresine (100 μM). The greater amount of resultant DOPA accumulation in the stalk median eminence of NAL-treated animals reflected increased TIDA neuronal activity compared to that in SAL-infused controls. Similar results were obtained when rats were treated in vivo with the DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor NSD 1015 (25 mg/kg BW) just before termination of the NAL infusion. Based on these results, we conclude that endogenous opioid peptides are essential in initiating and maintaining nocturnal PRL surges in pregnant rats. Moreover, opioids appear to exert their effects by decreasing TIDA neuronal activity. © 1991 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - In male house mice (Mus domesticus and M. musculus), the act of coital ejaculation provides a fail-safe neural signal for timing the birth of their offspring. A unique aspect of this phenomenon is the extraordinary latency that can occur between the stimules (ejaculation) and its adaptive neural response (male mice cease killing pups and behave parentally toward them). Thus the inhibition of infanticide is routinely time-delayed for many days after mating. In the absence of mating, cohabitation with a female will not inhibit infanticide in CF-1 stock males (M. domesticus), whereas the birth of pups in the male's home cage will inhibit infanticide. But with regard to the ejaculatory phenomenon, which also includes the spontaneous reemergence of infanticide 50-60 days after mating, this entire bahavioral cycle toward pups can occur in the total absence of regular time cues from a light/dark cycle following ejaculation. However, exposure to photoperiodic (L:D 12:12) or constant light (LL) accelerated the transition time from infanticide to parenting after ejaculation, while in constant dark (DD), the transition time to parenting was significantly prolonged. The time interval between ejaculation and the inhibition of infanticide, which varied among individuals first mated at 6 months of age, was repeatable when the same males were remated at 9 months of age; however, when males were again mated at 18 months of age, the time interval between ejaculation and parenting was dramatically prolonged. In general coital ejaculation triggers a neural timing system that cannot be explained by any presently known physiological mechanism. Our results do suggest, however, that the neural timing variation observed among individuals is influenced by sex steroid exposure during late fetal development. © 1991.

AB  - Delay in fetal maturation in diabetic and accelerated fetal maturation in hypertensive pregnancies have been reported in the past. The spontaneous activity of the fetal nervous system during pregnancy was followed longitudinally in a group of 29 normal pregnancies from the 28th to the 40th week of gestation by means of fetal behavioural states determination. 1 F state (quiet sleep) progressively increases from median values of 5.0% to values of 22.5-25% at term of pregnancy. This state represents the positive activity of inhibitory centers and has been related to a positive evolutionary process of brain maturation, according to preceding experiences conducted on experimental models and preterm babies followed with EEG and direct observation in the early neonatal period. The method of behavioural states determination has been applied to a group of 33 gestational diabetes (GDM) pregnant women followed longitudinally, and a clear reduction of development of 1 F state has been evidentiated, with significant differences (p < 0.001) at 35-36 weeks of gestation versus the control group. The normal values are reached in concomitance with L/S value of maturity. In 30 pregnant women affected by gestational hypertension (GH) different results are obtained: 1 F state seems to develop earlier, and is increased (p < 0.001) around 30-32 weeks versus the control group if a fetal growth reduction is present. The value of 1 F behavioural state in the evaluation of fetal condition of pathological pregnancies is discussed.

AB  - Summary: Serum prolactin (HPR) levels are influenced by waking and sleep states, as reflected by surges in serum concentrations during daytime naps and nocturnal sleep. Other physiological causes of hyperprolactinemia include sexual activity, pregnancy, and lactation. Drugs may stimulate or inhibit HPR secretion. Pathological causes for HPR secretion include destructive lesions of the hypothalamus, prolactin‐secreting neoplasms of the pituitary gland, lesions of the spinal cord, and occasionally Parkinson's disease. The most predictable postictal changes are increased serum Cortisol levels and hyperprolactinemia. Serum HPR rises after virtually all generalized tonic‐clonic seizures, most complex partial seizures, and some simple partial seizures. Absence and myoclonic seizures do not affect serum HPR levels. Repeated epileptic seizures and electroconvulsive therapy treatments produce successively less marked rises in serum HPR. The postictal elevation of serum Cortisol has a longer latency than for HPR and follows an earlier rise in serum ACTH. Other postictal hormonal changes are much more variable. Because of the normal diurnal variation in serum Cortisol levels and the relative delay in the postictal elevation of serum Cortisol, HPR is more useful as a diagnostic measure of epileptic seizures. This application of HPR requires an understanding of other factors that influence serum HPR and the use of baseline serum HPR levels for comparison. HPR data must be correlated with behavioral and electroencephalographic events. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Developmental changes in basal and circadian fluctuations in plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and cortisol (F) from birth until 3 months of life were studied in conjunction with morphological characteristics of the fetal and neonatal adrenal cortex in baboons (Papio anubis). These studies were complimented by measurements of in vitro production of DHEAS and F (basal and ACTH stimulated) by adrenal tissue slices. Cortisol, DHEAS, estrone, estradiol, and progesterone were determined in plasma and incubation medium by specific RIA. After delivery, an initial rise in plasma DHEAS was sustained for 4 days, followed by a precipitous decline, which reached a nadir between days 10–12 postpartum. Thereafter, plasma DHEAS and F concentrations stabilized with minor fluctuations. A significant (P < 0.05) and persistent diurnal rhythm in DHEAS and F secretion was evident by the end of the first week after birth. Administration of estrone acetate and progesterone in oil maintained neonatal plasma concentrations of estrone, estradiol, and progesterone at levels comparable to those in utero, but had no quantitative or qualitative effect on the pattern of plasma DHEAS or F in the neonate. The relative production of F to DHEAS by tissue slices in vitro (the calculated F/DHEAS ratios) indicates that DHEAS secretion by the fetal adrenal is 10-fold higher than that of F near parturition; ACTH stimulation does not alter this relationship. By postnatal day 10, the basal production rates of F and DHEAS are equivalent, and the response to ACTH stimulation favors production of F. With advancing neonatal age (at 30 and 100 days), there is an increase in the F/DHEAS secretion ratio both during the basal state and in response to ACTH. The baboon adrenal glands increased in weight during the last month of gestation and then stabilized during the early postnatal period; a gradual increase in weight was observed after 30 days postpartum. Within 2 weeks after parturition, the relative width of the fetal zone decreased dramatically to occupy less than one third of the total cortex. During involution, we observed a decrease in cell size and a reduction in cytoplasmic vacuolation. A zone of closely packed cells with numerous areas of cell death (the dense band) separated the zona fasciculata from the fetal zone. Cell proliferation was observed in the upper regions of the definitive cortex. We conclude the following. 1) The hypothalamic-hypophyseal mechanisms that regulate the diurnal adrenal secretory rhythm are established in the early neonatal period in the baboon. 2) The unique postnatal changes in adrenal morphology and secretion are probably a response to the different degrees of ACTH stimulation that result from changes in the MCR of F. 3) Circulating placental estrogens and progesterone may not contribute to the relative 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency in the baboon fetal adrenal. 4) The fetal zone involutes gradually after birth with areas of focal necrosis but without hemorrhage. We suggest that the zona fasciculata develops by progressive proliferation of new cells within its upper margins and not by transformation of preexisting cells in the fetal zone. © 1991 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Pregnant rats were treated with ethanol intragastrically (5.8 g/kg in two divided doses) spaced 4 hr apart on gestation days (GD) 7 and 8. Ganglioside GM1 was injected (10 mg/kg, IM) 24 hr and 1 hr prior to ethanol on GD7 and 1 hr prior on GD8. The controls received saline only. Maternal blood alcohol reached peak levels of 4.3 mg/ml within 2 hr in both groups. There were no significant differences between the groups gain body weight, gestation time, or the litter size. There were also no significant differences in birth weight and the brain weight of the pups. At the age of 45 days, equal number of male offspring from each group were tested for hypnotic effect (sleep time) of ethanol challenge dose (3.5 g/kg). Animals that received ethanol alone in utero had a shorter sleep time compared to no ethanol controls (81 ± 19 and 130 ± 28 min respectively, P<.01). Ganglioside GM1 treated animals had sleep time similar to that of controls (131 ± 21 min). There were no significant differences in wakeup blood alcohol the groups. These results indicate that pretreatment with GM1 ganglioside of maternal rats antagonized decrease in sleep time in offspring induced by prenatal ethanol exposure. Copyright © 1991 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

AB  - Fifty-two pregnant teenagers were assessed at 'booking' using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ 28), a locus of control scale, and five visual analogue 'attitude scales'. Thirty-eight were in the antenatal and 14 in the termination clinic. One quarter had probable psychiatric disorder on the GHQ. The GHQ scores correlated significantly with indecision about the planned outcome of pregnancy (whether termination or full term). Locus of control correlated with the Depression scale of the GHQ but not with attitude to pregnancy or choice of termination or delivery. Clinic staff should be alert to the psychiatric risks when seeing teenagers who have marked doubts about their plans when pregnant.

AB  - Long-term recordings of the electroencephalograms (EEGs) from the non-human fetal primate have been visually scored for state. Data were obtained from three fetuses using recently developed techniques for chronic instrumentation of the pregnant baboon. Seven days or more after surgery, nine chart records of 4-5 h in duration were analyzed. These records were made during an interval in gestation from 143 to 153 days (term = 175 to 185 days). Criteria for differentiation of EEG state were based on the presence (state 1) or absence (state 2) of trace alternant, which is the predominant characteristic of EEG activity during quiet sleep in human preterm and term infants. Two patterns of EEG activity were readily distinguished at both standard (30 mm/s) and compressed (30 mm/min) EEG chart speeds. On a minute-by-minute basis, there was an overall concurrence of 82.9% for EEG state when scored from compressed and standard EEG records. From the compressed records, state 1 was present on average 38.3% of the time, with a mean epoch duration of 15.1 min, while epochs of state 2 averaged 25.9 min. We conclude that at least two EEG states are present at this gestation in the fetal baboon. These two states can be reliably defined visually by scoring methods directly comparable to those used for EEG recognition of sleep states in the human newborn infant. To validate the conclusion that these fetal state assignments based on patterns of EEG activity correspond to sleep states, it will be necessary to determine if the oscillations of other physiological parameters are coherent with these patterns.

AB  - A 32 yr-old woman in her last trimester of pregnancy was found to have severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The overnight polysomnogram demonstrated an apnea plus hypopnea index of 159 events per hour. Apneas were associated with severe oxygen desaturation to 40% during rapid eye movement sleep, maternal bradycardia, and second degree heart block. External cardiotocography showed normal fetal heart rate reactivity to fetal movements, even during the apneas and episodes of oxygen desaturation. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure at a level of 15 cm H2O effectively treated the apneas and desaturation and had no effect on the fetal heart rate. The patient was induced electively during the 39th wk of pregnancy and gave birth to a newborn with growth retardation. Early recognition and treatment of OSA in pregnancy might prevent problems with fetal development.

AB  - We studied maternal and fetal blood pressure, heart rate, arterial blood gases and fetal behavioral state alterations in response to maternally administered cocaine hydrochloride in 11 pregnant sheep. Cocaine administration to the ewe caused a dose-dependent increase in maternal blood pressure and heart rate and in fetal blood pressure, and a decrease in fetal arterial oxygen tension. In the ewe, blood pressure changes corresponded linearly to dose administered (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). Blood pressure changes were correlated to peak plasma cocaine concentration in the ewe (r = 0.52, p < 0.01) and in the fetus (r = 0.43, p < 0.05). In addition, in 7 of 8 fetuses which had entered rapid eye movement (REM) sleep within 5 min of maternal cocaine administration, REM sleep was abruptly terminated either by the cocaine, fetal hypoxia or some other nonspecific event caused by the maternal cocaine administration. Maternal cocaine administration causes maternal and fetal hemodynamic alterations that have potential adverse effects in pregnancy.

AB  - Fetal heart rate and fetal movements were recorded in 16 uncomplicated near-term pregnancies. The recordings were used to evaluate a system for automated fetal heart rate analysis (Sonicaid System 8000). Fetal rest-activity patterns were considered in the analysis. The mean duration of C2F periods "active sleep," 33 minutes) was significantly greater than that of C1F periods ("quiet sleep," 19 minutes) (p < 0.001). The incidence of accelerations and decelerations and the overall fetal heart rate variations were greater during C2F than during C1F (p < 0.001). In 11 of 16 C1F periods, the system classified the fetal heart rate variation as "questionable" or "abnormal." Episodes of high variation were identified in only 3 or 16 C1F periods, but they were found in all 18 C2F periods. Episodes of low variation were identified in 14 of the 16 C1F periods but were not found in any C2F periods. During C2F periods, the system's criteria of normality were met in all cases but one; they were not met during any of the C1F periods. Thus the diagnosis of fetal distress should not be based merely on the absence of accelerations, low fetal heart rate variation, or absence of episodes of high variation in recordings with a duration of < 45 minutes. © 1991.

AB  - Pregnant dams were subjected to REM sleep deprivation during different stages of pregnancy. Pups were reared by their biological mothers and tested as adults for susceptibility to PTZ-induced convulsions, and ambulation and defecation in an open-field arena. Adrenal weights were taken at this time. Those animals whose mothers had been stressed during the first trimester showed a reduction in ambulatory behavior measured in the open field, and a reduction in adrenal weight after open-field exposure. Subjects exposed to prenatal stress (PNS) during the 2nd trimester showed an increased susceptibility to PTZ-induced clonic convulsions, and a reduction in adrenal weight after PTZ administration and open-field exposure. Finally, subjects exposed to PNS during the third trimester showed a reduction in susceptibility to PTZ compared with 2nd week PNS pups. The results showed different patterns of prenatal stress-induced behavioral and physiological changes, depending on the developmental stage in which the stress was applied. © 1991.

AB  - Lung distension with 100% O2 at a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cm H2O may induce continuous fetal breathing movements (FBM) in sheep. The objectives of this study were 1) to investigate the relative roles of lung distension and oxygenation and 2) to test the hypothesis that FBM can be induced during labor, when normally they are greatly reduced or absent. We studied 13 chronically instrumented, unanesthetized fetal sheep between 128 and 144 d of gestation (term = 147 ± 2 d). Each fetus was instrumented to record sleep states, diaphragm electromyogram, blood pressure, arterial pH, and blood gas tensions. The fetal lungs were distended via an in situ endotracheal tube with four different concentrations of O2 (0, 21, 50 and 100%) at a continuous positive airway pressure of 10, 20 and 30 cm H2O in a randomized order. No change in any recorded physiologic variable was observed at 129 ± 1 or 132 ± 1 d of gestation. At 135 ± 1 and 138 ± 1 d, in response to a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cm H2O and 100% O2, pH decreased (p = 0.0004 and 0.005, respectively) and arterial O2 tension increased (p = 0.004 and 0.02, respectively). However, increases in 1) breathing time, 2) breathing time/low-voltage electrocortical activity ratio, 3) duration of arousal, and 4) length of single breathing epochs were observed only at 138 ± 1 d. Lung distension with N2 resulted in a decrease in FBM. Six fetuses were studied during labor. Significant increase in total breathing time, stimulation of breathing during quiet sleep, and increased duration of arousal were observed with an increase in fetal arterial O2 tension. The onset of breathing always coincided with the onset of arousal. We conclude that fetal maturity, an increase in fetal arterial O2 tension, and a change in state from quiet sleep toward arousal are necessary conditions for the induction of FBM. © 1991 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - β-Blockers are used in pregnancy-associated hypertension and in postnatal cardiac arrhythmias, and the neonate may get them in breast milk. We therefore studied the effects of β-adrenergic medication on interrelations between heart rate (HR), respiration, and arterial blood pressure (aBP) in newborn lambs. The influence of sleep state on these cardiorespiratory interrelations was also examined. HR, aBP, and respiration (based on transthoracic electrical impedance) were recorded and the sleep state was visually documented in five healthy chronically instrumented newborn lambs before the age of 30 d. Propranolol was given (1 mg/kg). Two-min stationary segments of the three signals were analyzed using a multivariate autoregressive model, which yields oscillations of the signals and intersignal relationships as source contributions. The variabilities of aBP and HR were greatest at the low frequencies (<0.25 Hz) and so were their intersignal relationships (including baroreflex). The respiratory variability was greatest at the frequencies corresponding to the respiratory rate. During quiet sleep, the variabilities in HR, aBP, and respiration were lowest. The impact of respiratory oscillations on other signals increased but the impact of aBP variability decreased during quiet sleep. β-Blockade and sleep state affected separately the cardiovascular and respiratory variables and their interrelations. β-Blockade reduced HR and increased pulse pressure. The overall heart rate variability and the respiratory low-frequency contribution to heart rate variability decreased due to the β-blockade. We postulate that the β-adrenergic system is an important regulator of HR and HR variability in neonatal lambs and also of the low-frequency components of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia. However, inasmuch as the interrelations between HR and aBP were not altered by the β-blockade, even high doses of propranolol do not seem hazardous for the cardiovascular system in neonatal lambs. © 1991 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - This paper reviews epidemiological studies, human experimental studies, and animal research on the non-auditory effects of noise on health. The following topics are covered: vegetative responses (e.g., blood pressure, digestion), biochemical effects, excretion of catecholamines, sleep, physical illness, subjective annoyance, and mental health. Combined effects of noise and other occupational health hazards on physiological functioning and health are also reviewed. Overall, the results suggest that there are non-auditory health effects. However, these require confirmation in prospective, longitudinal studies with interventions reducing noise levels. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Cause is unknown; sporadic occurrence is the rule. Data presented in this review include the characteristics of pregnancy, growth and development, principal manifestations, radiographic and ophthalmological characteristics, and the results of cephalometric study. Potential complications in the syndrome are related to the narrow upper airway associated with the craniofacial configuration. Severe complications may include early pulmonary infection, respiratory embarrassment, obstructive sleep apnea, and anesthetic risk. Topics for future study are suggested.

AB  - Oral contraceptive use is influenced by multiple emotional factors. Physiological and psychological effects are closely correlated. Contraception may assist women in pursuing important psychosocial goals, on the other hand, it may cause a number of problems. Many unconscious wishes or fears may interfere with the clear separation of sexuality from fertility. Ambivalence about pregnancy, neurotic personalities and problems in partner relationship may cause psychic conflicts with regard to contraception. Anxiety, side effects, misuse of contraceptives or problems in the relationship between doctor and patient may result. As a further development psychosomatic symptoms such as discomfort, nervousness, sleep disturbance, fatigue, nausea and sexual disorders may appear. The physician must take contradictory feelings of the patient into consideration, including her anxiety and her possible ambivalence with respect to pregnancy.
Oral contraceptive (OCs) which are highly effective, simple to use, and reversible, are used by 50 million women globally. In Germany 37.1% of women used them in 1985. Recently their acceptance has declined because of the fear of side effects such as cancer, thrombophlebitis, and frigidity. Other negative factors are opposition of partner, religious views, inconvenience of daily intake, negative reports from the press, discussion by family physician, and anxiety about complications in the offspring. Psychological and psychosomatic side effects very from 1% to 56%. Most are psychovegetative symptoms: headache, sweating, heart disorders, gastrointestinal tract (GI) disorders, nausea, and sleep disturbance. Psychological symptoms include increased irritability, impulsiveness, affective lability, anxiety, depressive feelings, reduced libido, and sexual disorders. Unconscious and ambivalent feelings about wanting a child and problems with the partner can result in forgetting to take the pill. Inhibitions, shame, guilt, and repressed feelings about sexuality lead to a sense of victimization in the form of pregnancy. The Catholic Church holds the view that contraception and abortion are unnatural as enunciated in a 1968 encyclical on human life. Conflicts with the partner can be resolved by compromise and by medical counseling of both parties. True psychopathological disorders have to be distinguished from the psychological problems of healthy people. The soundness of the physician-patient relationship is essential for contraceptive counseling and for resolving such conflicts.

AB  - The effects of sleeping position upon body temperature were assessed by continuous monitoring of rectal temperature in 137 babies sleeping at home under conditions chosen by their parents. There were three groups of subjects: (1) normal babies aged 12-22 weeks whose temperature rhythms were developed, (2) normal babies aged 6-12 weeks who were developing their night time temperature rhythms, and (3) babies the night after diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus immunisation, whose temperature rhythms were disturbed. Sleeping in the prone position was not associated with higher rectal temperatures at any time of night in young babies, nor did it exaggerate the disturbance of rectal temperature rhythm after immunisation. In older normal babies the prone position did not disturb rectal temperature in the first part of the night, though prone sleepers warmed a little faster prior to waking, especially in warm conditions. Prone sleepers were, however, born earlier in gestation and tended to be of lower birth weight. Normal babies can therefore thermoregulate effectively whatever their sleeping posture, even in warm conditions, though the prone position may make it slightly more difficult to lose heat. It is difficult to see how the prone position, even interacting with warm conditions, could induce lethal hyperthermia in otherwise normal babies. Perhaps the prone position is associated with other risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome.

AB  - The rate of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in Southern New Zealand has been very high with an apparent real increase in incidence from the early 1970s. Recent research is reviewed and the results of specific interventions aimed at preventing SIDS summarized. The intervention consisted of strongly advising new parents that their babies sleep on their back or side and that they avoid over‐heating, especially during infections. For the Otago area, child‐care practice has been documented and prone sleeping of 1 month old babies has declined from 41.8% in 1986 to 2.4% in 1989‐90. There is also evidence that parental control of infants' thermal environment has improved, maternal smoking during pregnancy has slightly decreased and the number of babies breast fed at 1 month of age has increased by 11%. In Southern NZ there has been a decline in post‐neonatal SIDS mortality from 6.3 deaths per 1000 live births 1979‐84 to 1.3 per 1000 live births in 1990. There are grounds for supposing that the intervention has been causative of this change, a possibility being addressed by on‐going studies. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Summary: Rest‐activity patterns were studied in fetuses exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and in control fetuses at three intervals during pregnancy: 20, 32, and 38 weeks. At 20 weeks, periods of rest and activity were distinguished on the basis of fetal motility. Trunk, head, and arm movements were totaled. Periods of absence of movements for >3 min were found in 20 of 31 recordings from AED‐exposed fetuses compared with 11 of 20 recordings from controls (p > 0.05). The duration of these periods of inactivity did not differ significantly between the two groups. At 32 and 38 weeks, information on fetal motility and fetal heart rate (FHR) were combined to recognize rest‐activity patterns according to the fetal behavioral state concept. At 32 weeks, three true fetal behavioral states were found for the study group, while there were none in the control group. Coincidence 1F through 4F occurred significantly less frequently at 32 weeks than at 38 weeks, regardless of whether fetuses were AED‐exposed or not: 59% vs. 82% for the study group and 59% vs. 80% for the controls. At 38 weeks, true fetal behavioral states appeared in 20 of 34 fetuses exposed to AEDs and in 17 of 35 controls (p > 0.05). The sequence in which parameters changed within state transitions was found to follow the same preferred pattern in both groups. For transitions from behavioral state 1F (quiet sleep) into 2F (active sleep) the FHR pattern changed significantly earlier than fetal body or eye movements, while for the reverse transitions the FHR pattern changed significantly later (p < 0.05). No clearly preferred sequence of the other two state parameters was found. We concluded that chronic intrauterine exposure to AEDs does not affect fetal rest‐activity patterns.

AB  - Subject of this review is the pathophysiology of the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), the apnea, and the sudden-death infant syndrome (SIDS). The fatality rate of the RDS yet amounts to 24%. Preterm infants are preferably involved because of their deficient surfactant synthesis. The lack of surfactant causes atelectases, hyaline membranes, lung oedema, and augmentation of respiration work. Only towards the very end of gestation the amount of surfactant of the fetal lung increases rapidly so that the normal postnatal respiration is guaranteed. RDS produces a pathological circulatory situation with insufficiency of the right heart and congestion. The atrial natriuretic hormone is increased about tenfold in the serum of RDS-infants. Modern treatment of the RDS uses instillations of exogenous surfactants before the first breath. Apneic attacks are observed predominantly during REM-sleep. They seem to have pathological value only if they exceed 15 seconds. Infants with recurrent apnoea breathe periodically, they were mostly preterm newborns. Probably, the cause of recurrent apneic attacks are central regulatory deficits and adenosine may play an important pathological role as neurotransmitter. Arrhythmias of the heart including the QT-syndrome observed in SIDS-infants at risk may have the same central pathophysiological source.

AB  - The rhythmic organization underlying long‐term heart rate variability was examined in 36 newborn infants. Heart rate was registered every 30 s for 2 continuous hr while infants rested in a temperature‐controlled isolette. Spectrum analysis of the time‐series of the 240 observations detected rhythmically organized changes in the heart rates of 33 of the 36 infants. Thirty of the 33 infants showed a basic rhythm at 1.5 ± 5 cycles per hr (one cycle every 30 to 60 min). While 9 infants showed this single cycle in behavioral activity, 24 infants showed additional cycles at a wide range of faster frequencies. Infants with signs of atypical fetal growth less often showed evidence of these multiple cycles, had reliably fewer cycles in heart rate, and had a marginally lower power in their basic cycle than infants with typical patterns of fetal growth. Infants with multiple cycles in the power spectra, independent of fetal growth group, were more often observed in Alert and Active Alert behavioral states and less often in Active Sleep than comparison infants. Results indicate that (1) heart rates of newborn infants show evidence of the 30‐ to 60‐min cycle characteristic of the Basic Rest‐Activity Cycle found in other behaviors, and (2) the complexity of behavioral rhythms may be affected by prenatal malnutrition. Viewed within a dynamical systems approach to development, results suggest that the complexity of rhythms in behavior may reflect the complexity of behavioral organization.

AB  - Leaves of Maytenus species are used in the popular medicine of Brazil for their reported antacid and antiulcerogenic activity. The present work examined the effects of a boiling water extract of equal parts of M. aquifolium and M. ilicifolia leaves on acute administration in rats and mice, in an attempt to detect any general depressant, hypnotic, anticonvulsant and analgesic effects. General depressant and hypnotic effects were seen only after intraperitoneal administration. After chronic administration, the overall behavior of animals did not change and they continued to gain weight at the same rate as controls. Several biochemical and hematological parameters as well as pathological examination of different organs did not show any significant alterations after 3 months of treatment. A search for the potential effects of the extract on the fertility of female and male rats and on the course of pregnancy as well as a search for potential teratogenic effects did not reveal any significant differences from controls. Taken together, the results indicate that these Maytenus species may be safe for human use and deserve further investigation. © 1991.

AB  - Recent anthropological interest in sexuality has been closely related to symbolic constructions of gender in different societies. Most studies explore the cultural constitution of sexual meanings without addressing how sex is experienced by actors. Material from the Bumbita Arapesh of the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea reveals that the local cultural ideology of male sexual domination does not adequately describe actual sexual experiences of Bumbita men and women. Cultural ideology states that men control sexual encounters as a part of their masculine essence, yet in actual marriages women often take the initiative in limiting sexual practice following postpartum prohibitions. Contrary to cultural expectations, men exhibit anxiety concerning sexual relations in a marriage. The public assertion of sexual dominance and suppression of sexual intimacy compensate for a sense of vulnerability accompanying sexual experience. An analytical distinction between "cultural ideology" and "individual experience" helps clarify the climate of sexual relationships in a cultural context. © 1991.

AB  - 1. Bolus i.v. doses of 14C-propofol (7-10 mg/kg) to rat, dog and rabbit, or an infusion dose (0.47mg/kg per min for 6h) to dog were eliminated primarily in urine (60-95% dose); faecal elimination (13-31% occurred for rat and dog, but was minimal (&lt;2% for rabbit. 2. After bolus administration, blood 14C concentrations were maximal (8-30 μg equiv./ml) at 2-15 min; these declined rapidly during the 0-2 h period and thereafter more slowly. Propofol concentrations were maximal (4-16 μml) at 2 min and the profiles were best fitted by a tri-exponential (rat and dog) or bi-exponential (rabbit) equation. Duration of sleep ranged from 5 to 8 min. 3. Infusion of 1C-propofol in dog gave a blood 14C concentration of 117 μg equiv./ml at the end of the 6 h infusion period; this declined at a similar rate to that after the bolus dose. Propofol concentration on termination of infusion was 13 μg/ml; thereafter, propofol concentrations declined less rapidly than after the bolus dose. Waking occurred about 44 min post-infusion. 4. Propofol was cleared by conjugation of the parent molecule or its quinol metabolite; hydroxylation of an isopropyl group also occurred in rat and rabbit. Biliary excretion leading to enterohepatic recirculation, and in turn increased sulphate conjugation, occurred in rat and dog, but not rabbit, resulting in a marked interspecies variation in drug clearance and metabolite profiles. © 1991 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - SYSTEM 8000 is a computerized system for antenatal fetal heart rate (FHR) analysis, with interaction online to ensure good quality recording and to minimize the time required to obtain the necessary information (based on fetal movements and tocodynamometer readings as well as FHR). The equipment consists of a Personal Computer with hard disk, interfaced to a fetal monitor. Software is written in C. An extensive definition is given on most of the functions and parameters as calculated by the system, e. g. record quality, uterine contraction peaks, basal heart rate, variation, decelerations and accelerations. System 8000 is designed to take account of the episodic changes in FHR and fetal movements characteristic of sleep states. Their presence naturally affects the mean FHR variation calculated over, say 20—30 mins. But, as the amplitude of these episodes is attenuated in association with growth retardation and hypoxaemia, the measurements of variation decline. In practice inter- and intra-observer variation is greatest in assessing FHR variation. Yet a decrease in variation is the most reliable index of fetal deterioration. The system measures FHR variation accurately and reproducibly, as well as fetal movements. In the synoptic display these two equally important fetal variables are given their rightful prominence. It has been interesting to observe how rarely the basal FHR changes in fetuses suffering progressive respiratory insufficiency, and how extreme tachycardia (a basal rate > 170/min) tends to reflect other fetal problems such as infection or maternal pyrexia. © 1991 by Walter de Gruyter & Co.

AB  - We studied the association between the prenatal diets of 212 mothers assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and the blood pressure of their infants. Prenatal potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes were measured and adjusted for total caloric intake. Infant blood pressure was measured at 2-3 days and at 1, 6, and 12 months of age by using an ultrasonic-auscultatory device and was adjusted for cuff size, observer, and sleep/ activity status, age in days in neonates, and weight at 6 and 12 months. Maternal prenatal potassium intake was inversely related to diastolic pressure at 6 months (r= -0.28, p<0.01) and at 12 months (r =- 0.30, p<0.05). After adjustment for neonatal breast versus formula feeding, maternal prenatal calcium intake was inversely related to systolic blood pressure at 1 month (r=-0.21,p<0.01), and to diastolic blood pressure at 6 months (r=-0.27,p<0.01) and 12 months (r=-0.24,p<0.05). Maternal prenatal magnesium intake was inversely related to 6-month systolic blood pressure (r=-0.20, p<0.05). In multivariable models with all three cations, maternal prenatal potassium intake was independently and inversely related to diastolic blood pressure at 6 and 12 months. Maternal prenatal calcium intake was indepen-dently related to 1-month systolic and 6-month diastolic blood pressure. Age-specific infant blood pressure differences between the upper and lower quartiles of maternal prenatal cation intakes ranged from 3 to 7 mm Hg. These results are consistent with adult studies and suggest that maternal prenatal intakes of potassium, calcium, and perhaps magnesium, influence infant blood pressure throughout the first year of life.

AB  - Synopsis Atenolol is a selective β1-adrenoceptor antagonist with a duration of activity of at least 24 hours. The scope of therapeutic use of the drug has been expanded and become better defined since it was first reviewed in the Journal in 1979. Atenolol is effective and generally well tolerated in patients with all grades of hypertension. Data from comparative studies show that when administered orally, atenolol reduces blood pressure to a similar extent, and in a similar proportion of patients, as usual therapeutic doses of other β- adrenoceptor antagonists (such as acebutolol, celiprolol, betaxolol, indenolol, metoprolol, nadolol, pindolol, propranolol, tertatolol), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g. captopril, enalapril and lisinopril), calcium antagonists (e.g. amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nitrendipine, nifedipine, verapamil), doxazosin, ketanserin and α-methyldopa. Atenolol effectively lowers blood pressure in elderly patients with hypertension and in women with hypertension associated with pregnancy, and improves objective and subjective indices in patients with stable angina pectoris. Oral atenolol is used for preventing recurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias once control is achieved by intravenous administration of atenolol. Early intervention with intravenous atenolol followed by oral maintenance therapy reduces infarct recurrence and cardiovascular mortality in patients with known or suspected myocardial infarction. There is also encouraging evidence of reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease during long term therapy with atenolol in patients with hypertension. Atenolol is well tolerated in most patients. Increases in plasma levels of both total triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides have accompanied atenolol therapy although the clinical relevance, if any, of longer term metabolic effects has yet to be determined. Its low lipid solubility and limited brain penetration results in a lower incidence of central nervous system effects than that associated with propranolol. After many years of clinical usage atenolol is a well established treatment option in several areas of cardiovascular medicine such as mild to moderate hypertension and stable angina pectoris. Furthermore, it has also shown potential in the treatment of some cardiac arrhythmias and has been associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in patients with hypertension and in patients with myocardial infarction. Pharmacodynamic Properties Atenolol is a selective and long acting β1-adrenoceptor antagonist. In patients with hypertension, oral administration of atenolol significantly reduces resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures and attenuates the blood pressure increase induced by exercise. In some studies, long term administration of atenolol 50 to 100mg daily improved left ventricular hypertrophy when present before treatment. In patients with coronary artery disease the antihypertensive effects of atenolol are accompanied by reductions in heart rate (8 to 34%) and rate-pressure product (9 to 40%). Atenolol improves indices of oxygen consumption in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Short or long term administration of atenolol 50 to 100mg daily reduces blood pressure in pregnant women. Although impaired glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance have been reported in some patients treated with atenolol, improved glucose tolerance has been reported in others. Increases in plasma total triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein triglycerides, and decreases in high density lipoprotein cholesterol generally occur after several months’ treatment with atenolol, but these changes are less pronounced than those associated with propranolol and a trend towards a reduction in effect has been noted during long term administration. Atenolol 50 to 125mg impairs respiratory function in asthmatic patients, following single or multiple doses, to a lesser extent than propranolol, and does not significantly decrease the bronchodilatation effect of inhaled salbutamol during short or long term treatment. Pharmacokinetic Properties Following oral administration, about 50 to 60% of an atenolol dose is absorbed with maximum plasma concentrations reached within 2 to 4 hours. Atenolol is widely distributed in the body (although only a small proportion of an administered dose reaches the brain), and readily crosses the placenta. In adult patients with normal renal function the elimination half-life is about 5 to 7 hours and total clearance is about 6 L/h (100 ml/min) per 1.73m2. A shorter elimination half-life (4.5 hours) has been observed in children. However, there are wide intra- and interindividual differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of atenolol. Most absorbed atenolol is excreted unchanged in the urine. Accumulation into breast milk has been reported but plasma concentrations are negligible in infants. In patients with renal dysfunction the elimination rate is decreased and is related to glomerular filtration rate. Therapeutic Efficacy During long term follow-up trials with atenolol, generally 50 to 100mg once daily alone or in combination with a diuretic, goal blood pressures are achieved in about two-thirds of all patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The greatest reductions in blood pressure occur in the first 2 weeks of treatment, and blood pressure remains within normal limits during extended therapy without major adjustment of dosage. Atenolol 50 to lOOmg daily is clearly more effective than placebo in reducing blood pressure, and in comparative trials it reduced blood pressure in a similar proportion of patients, and to a similar extent, as usual therapeutic doses of other β-adrenoceptor antagonists (acebutolol, celiprolol, betaxolol, indenolol, SR metoprolol, nadolol, SR pindolol, SR propranolol, tertatolol), ACE inhibitors [captopril (100mg), enalapril (20 to 40mg) and lisinopril (20 to 80mg)], calcium antagonists [amlodipine (2.5 to 10mg), diltiazem (240 to 360mg), felodipine (10 to 20mg), isradipine (5 to 20mg), SR nifedipine (20 to 40mg), SR verapamil (240mg) and nitrendipine (20 to 40mg)], doxazosin 1 to 16mg, ketanserin 40 to 80mg and α-methyldopa 1500mg daily. Elderly patients and women with hypertension associated with pregnancy respond well to treatment with atenolol 50 and 50 to 200mg daily, respectively. In patients with stable angina pectoris, oral atenolol 100mg daily was superior to placebo and at least as effective as usual therapeutic doses of other antianginal agents in reducing the severity and frequency of anginal attacks, reducing glyceryl trinitrate consumption, improving exercise duration, and extending time to lmm ST-segment depression. Atenolol appears to eliminate the morning ischaemic episode peak in patients with silent ischaemia. In patients with hypertension, with or without evidence of ischaemia, long term atenolol therapy reduced the mortality from myocardial infarction or stroke. In addition, early initiation of atenolol therapy reduced the incidence of both vascular mortality and the occurrence of non-fatal cardiac arrests and reinfarction in patients with suspected myocardial infarction. Preliminary investigation in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia revealed that atenolol reduced the occurrence of supraventricular tachycardia in up to 70% of patients. This benefit was maintained during long term follow-up and atenolol improved the clinical course of patients with sustained paroxysmal reciprocating supraventricular tachycardia. Following coronary artery surgery, orally administered atenolol was significantly superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of supraventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. Control of ventricular arrhythmias has also been achieved using oral atenolol therapy. Tolerability The most frequently reported adverse effects experienced during oral atenolol therapy for hypertension, angina pectoris and arrhythmias are bradycardia (0.6 to 10%), cold extremities/ Raynaud’s phenomenon (2 to 35%), gastrointestinal symptoms (0.5 to 32%), fatigue/weakness (1 to 51%), nightmares/sleep disturbances (6 to 26%), headache (1 to 18%), and sexual disturbances (1 to 14%). In general these effects were mild, occurred more frequently during baseline phases, usually become less frequent with continued therapy and, in most studies, necessitated withdrawal of treatment from only 3 to 6% of patients. Data from comparative studies suggest that the tolerability profile of atenolol is similar to that of other antihypertensive agents although the pattern of effects differed between drug classes. Both hypotension and bradycardia have been observed after intravenous administration of atenolol in patients with myocardial infarction. Atenolol therapy has not been associated with ophthalmological changes or clinically significant changes in haematological or biochemical indices. Dosage and Administration Most patients with hypertension respond to once daily oral administration of atenolol 50 to 100mg. The full effect is usually established within 2 weeks. If an optimal response is not achieved an additional antihypertensive agent such as a diuretic, calcium antagonist or ACE inhibitor could be added. It is unlikely that increasing the atenolol dose above 100 mg/day will result in additional benefit for patients receiving monotherapy or combination therapy. The majority of patients with angina pectoris will respond to 100mg daily given orally. For patients with arrhythmias a suitable initial dose is 2.5 to 5mg injected intravenously (1mg/min). This may be repeated at 5-minute intervals until a response is observed, up to a maximum dosage of 10mg. If atenolol is administered by infusion the initial dose should be 0.15 mg/kg over 20 minutes. If required, the injection or infusion may be repeated every 12 hours. Once arrhythmias have been controlled a suitable maintenance dose is 50 to 100mg once daily. For patients with suspected myocardial infarction, presenting within 12 hours of the onset of chest pain, intravenous atenolol (5mg infused over 5 minutes) should be administered immediately. A second 5mg dose may be given 10 minutes later. 15 minutes after the final infusion an oral 50mg dose should be administered. A second oral 50mg dose should be given after 12 hours and after a further 12 hours maintenance treatment with 100mg once daily should be initiated. Dosage adjustment is required in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 35 ml/min/ 1.73m2). Patients undergoing dialysis should be given an oral 50mg dose after each dialysis. Atenolol is not recommended for children, patients with overt heart failure or as first therapy in patients with asthma. Atenolol should be administered with caution in patients receiving concomitant class I antiarrhythmic agents or verapamil as these drugs have similar electrophysiological effects. Care must also be taken when administering atenolol to patients whose cardiac reserve is poor. © 1991, Adis International Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - In normal pregnancy the circadian blood pressure rhythm is similar to that in the non-pregnant state, with the highest blood pressure values in the morning and the lowest at mignight. This rhythm is lost in patients with pre-eclampsia. Women with severe pre-eclampsia show a reversed circadian rhythm, with a nocturnal increase in blood pressure during the sleeping phase. Although the reasons for this nocturnal hypertension in severe pre-eclampsia are poorly understood, the results suggest that pre-eclamptic women are endangered by hypertensive emergencies, mostly at night. Therefore blood pressure measurement should be extended to the night, and antihypertensive treatment must be adapted to the demands of a reversed circadian rhythm in relevant subgroups of patients.

AB  - The circadian rhythm of alpha-amylase, E.C. 3.2.1.1. (alpha-1,4-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase) in parotid gland of 25 day old rats was studied under different experimental conditions (fast, reversed photoperiod, constant light or darkness and treatment with reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine). The rhythm of rats fasted or exposed for 7 days to constant darkness did not change. There were modifications in the rhythm of rats submitted to a reversed photoperiod and it disappeared in animals submitted to constant light or darkness for 15 days or treated with reserpine or alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. The rhythm persisted, with minor changes in the acrophase, in parotids of rats kept during their gestation and post-natal life in constant light or darkness. Results suggest that the circadian rhythm of alpha-amylase in parotid gland of young rats is endogenous, synchronized by the photoperiod, under autonomous nervous system control and maternal coordination. This model appears to be useful in the study of sympathetic nervous system control of target organs and circadian rhythms in general.

AB  - To clarify the variation of mouse epidermal growth factor production during the 24-h and female reproductive cycles, we measured its concentrations in the plasma, submandibular salivary gland, urine, kidneys and liver of adult male and female mice during consecutive 12-h dark and 12-h light periods, different stages of pregnancy, and lactation. The concentration of epidermal growth factor in the submandibular gland showed no circadian changes. In plasma and in the liver it increased during the dark period, whereas in urine and in the kidneys it peaked in the daytime. In the submandibular gland the concentration decreased during early pregnancy, but it returned to the non-pregnant levels by mid-pregnancy. In plasma it decreased progressively during pregnancy and recovered during lactation. In urine and the kidneys the concentration of epidermal growth factor increased after early pregnancy; with a further great increase in the kidneys during lactation. In the liver the concentration was clearly below the non-pregnant levels during late pregnancy and lactation.

AB  - 1. Prolactin is a 21,500 Dalton single-chain polypeptide hormone but may occur in 50 kDa and 150 kDa molecular variants. 2. These large PRL variants may be secreted predominantly; this condition is termed "macroprolactinemia". It is characterized by high immunological and normal biological serum levels of prolactin, and lack of clinical symptoms of hyperprolactinemia. 3. The information on PRL is encoded on chromosome 6. Transcription can be enhanced and suppressed by a variety of hormonal factors. 4. PRL is secreted in a pulsatile fashion; it displays a circadian rhythm (with a maximum during sleep) and is stimulated by some amino acids. PRL also responds to mechanical stimulation of the breast. 5. PRL rises during pregnancy, and maintainance of hyperprolactinemia (and, thereby, physiological infertility) is dependent on the frequency and duration of breast feedings. 6. Hypothalamic regulation of prolactin mainly involves tonic inhibition via portal dopamine. The physiological importance of various stimulating factors present in the hypothalamus is still incompletely understood. In particular, there is still no place for TRH in PRL physiology. 7. PRL is released in response to stress; this response may be mediated by opioids. The low-estrogen, low-gonadotropin amenorrhea of endurancetraining women is not mediated by prolactin, however. 8. Estrogens stimulate PRL gene transcription via at least two independent mechanisms. There are many clinical examples of this estrogen effect on prolactin serum levels, and also on the growth of prolactinomas. 9. Mild hyperprolactinemia remains an enigma which cannot satisfactorily be resolved by biochemical or radiological testing. The border between "normal" and "elevated" prolactin is illdefined. The possibility of macroprolactinemia complicates this matter even further. 10. The number of drugs which suppress prolactin by acting on pituitary D2 receptors, and which are useful in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, continues to increase. In the field of ergot alkaloids, parenteral application appears to be a logical solution to the problem of the high first-pass effect; in addition, this form of treatment is frequently better tolerated than the oral route. 11. Prolactinoma development is presently being studied employing molecular biological techniques; the question of whether tumorigenesis can be attributed to specific defects of gene regulation remains to be answered. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - To investigate potential adverse effects of residency training on pregnancy outcome, a cohort study was conducted among 45 university-affiliated residency programs. Outcomes of the first pregnancy experienced during residency were compared between 92 female residents and 144 spouses of male residents. Despite long hours, sleep deprivation, and an increase in perceived stress, the female residents were as likely to give birth to a live, full-term newborn as the spouses of male residents. For white cohort members, an increased risk of premature labor without delivery was identified (RR = 12.3, 95% confidence interval 2.4-61.6). No significant differences were found in prematurity, spontaneous and therapeutic abortions, or presence of congenital abnormalities in the infants. Method of delivery and use of anesthetics and of other medications were similar in both groups. Pregnancy outcomes between the two groups were similar; however, the increased risk for premature labor among female residents is a cause for concern and should be further investigated.

AB  - The effects on breathing movements and sleep state of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) and its antagonist, proglumide, have been studied in unanaesthetised fetal lambs of 124-142 days gestation. CCK-8 when given into a lateral ventricle as bolus injections of 10-500 ng caused dose-related periods of apnea ranging from 63-214 min. When given as a 100 ng bolus followed by a 50 ng/h infusion for 2 h there was a prolonged period of apnea lasting 331 ± 56 min. There was no effect of CCK-8 when given in higher doses (1-50 μg). The antagonist proglumide reversed the apnea induced by CCK-8 infusion, but had no effect when given alone, nor did it affect the normal fetal depressive response to hypoxia. Neither CCK-8 nor proglumide had any effect on electrocortical activity. We conclude that CCK has no role in the inhibitory mechanisms causing the apnea associated with high voltage electrocortical activity or hypoxia in the fetus. Furthermore CCK does not appear to be involved in the regulation of sleep state in the fetal lamb.

AB  - 72 infants delivered normally were observed for 2 h after birth. In the separation group (n=34), the infant was placed on the mother's abdomen immediately after birth but removed after about 20 min for measuring and dressing. In the contact group (n=38) contact between mother and infant was uninterrupted for at least 1 h. After about 20 min the infants began to make crawling movements towards the breast; the rooting reflex soon came into play, and at an average of 50 min after birth most of the infants were sucking at the breast. More infants in the contact group than in the separation group showed the correct sucking technique (24/38 vs 7/34). 40 (56%) of the 72 mothers had received pethidine during labour; the infants were also sedated and most of them (25/40) did not suck at all. It is suggested that contact between mother and infant should be uninterrupted during the first hour after birth or until the first breast-feed has been accomplished, and that use of drugs such as pethidine should be restricted. © 1990.

AB  - The effect of oral contraceptives and of pregnancy on the daily rhythm of cortisol, and its metabolite cortisone in plasma and saliva has been investigated. In both conditions the total plasma cortisol levels were raised to the same extent, the mean values in saliva in the oral contraceptive users being intermediate between those in pregnancy and in the controls, particularly in the morning. Salivary cortisone levels were more related to salivary cortisol than to total plasma cortisone which exhibited a rather flat daily rhythm. There was a shift in peak values for salivary cortisol and cortisone towards late morning: this may be due to a delay in the daily activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in these patients. © 1990.

AB  - Intrauterine cocaine exposure causes subtle neurologic abnormalities in human newborn infants; however, the mechanism for these abnormalities is not known. To investigate whether cocaine alters fetal behavioral state, the electrocortical, electro-ocular and neck muscle electrical activity was monitored in 7 chronically instrumented fetal sheep before and during both saline and cocaine HCl infusions directly to the fetus. Saline infusion to the fetus had no effect on the percentage of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep compared to no infusion (37.5 ± 11.6% vs 46.3 ± 4.6%, mean ± SD, P &gt; 0.1). Cocaine infusion directly to the fetus had no effect on fetal arterial pO2, but did increase mean arterial pressure from 53.6 ± 15 mmHg to 61.0 ± 21 mmHg (P &lt; 0.01). In addition, during cocaine infusion, the percentage of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep dropped to 3.9 ± 5.1% (P &lt; 0.0001) and the average duration of rapid eye movement epochs decreased from 10.1 ± 3.0 min precocaine infusion to 1.9 ± 2.6 min during cocaine infusion (P &lt; 0.02). The influence of cocaine was noted in a frequency analysis of the electrocorticogram. The amplitude of the energy centered at 1 Hz during cocaine infusion (73.8 ± 4.0 dB) was greater than the amplitude during rapid eye movement sleep (65.5 ± 4.7 dB) and less than the amplitude during non-rapid eye movement periods (79.9 ± 4.5 dB) (P = 0.01). Cocaine appears to alter fetal behavioral state directly and this may play a role in the abnormal behavior in newborn infants exposed to cocaine in utero. © 1990.

AB  - The levels of folic acid and zinc in breast milk of about 25 women in their first trimester of lactation from each of eight towns in the Brazilian Amazon basin were determined. In order to compare the effects of age and parity on the breast milk folate and zinc levels, the results were analysed together. Thirty-one (60 per cent) of the women in their first month of lactation and 35 (51.5 per cent) in their second month had milk total folate levels below the calculated lower limit of adequacy; only 21 (47 per cent) of the women in their third month of lactation had milk total folate concentrations below the same limit. The breast milk zinc levels, however, were worse, with 35 (95 per cent) and 61 (97 per cent) of the women in their first and second months of lactation and all the women in their third month of lactation having values below the calculated lower limit of adequacy. Both in the case of total folate and zinc, the calculated lower limits of adequacy were obtained from the respective Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) of a 0-6 month old infant and the average milk production of lactating women. While the mean breast milk folate levels (both total and free) showed no significant changes during the months of lactation, the average milk zinc levels showed a significant decrease between the first and second and first and third months of lactation. The age of the women did not significantly influence either the breast milk folate or zinc levels. However, the milk folate concentrations showed a significant decrease (P < 0.05) amongst the multigravidae compared with the primigravidae. The breast milk zinc levels, on the other hand, were not influenced by the parity of the women.

AB  - Preliminary results obtained from 26 cases of prolactinomas less than 20 mm in diameter after treatment by enlarged adenomectomy are described. The operation consisted in removal of the adenoma, a layer of normal pituitary at the outer edge of the tumour and the pituitary capsule in contact with the sellar meninges. 24 women and 2 men were involved whose prolactin levels (PRL) were less than 200 ng/ ml. All presented abnormal PRL responses to Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and Metoclopramide (MCP) tests and an absence of a nocturnal rise in the sleep cycle study. Postoperatively, three patients developed transitory diabetes insipidus and five transitory adrenal insufficiency. Gonadotropin reserve was always found normal. All 24 women resumed normal menstrual cycles and two became pregnant within one year. From a serological viewpoint, after surgery 100% of patients were found to be normal for levels of prolactin but only 85% turned to normal dynamic tests. The results of this small series of enlarged adenomectomies seem better than those obtained using selective adenomectomy, but must be confirmed with time. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Noninvasive 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed in 17 normotensive and 19 preeclamptic pregnant women. The normotensive women showed a significant nightly decline in their systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, the preeclamptic women demonstrated either an attenuated circadian rhythm or no circadian rhythm at all. This result was even more pronounced in patients with severe hypertension, some of whom had a nocturnal increase in blood pressure in spite of being treated with antihypertensive drugs in an evening dose. The lack of nocturnal blood pressure decrease was also found 24 hours post partum. In summary, these results suggest that preeclamptic women are endangered by hypertensive emergencies mostly during the night. Therefore blood pressure controls should be extended into the night, and antihypertensive drugs should also be given in a sufficient evening dose. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Neurogenesis of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) was described in the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) using tritiated [3H]thymidine autoradiography. Pregnant hamsters were given single intraperitoneal injections of [3H]thymidine at different times during prenatal development, and labeled cells were analyzed in the offspring of 4-5 weeks of age. Cells of the hamster SCN became postmitotic (were 'born') over two and a half days from 10.5 to 13.0 days postfertilization (dpf) with a peak around 11.5 dpf, 4 days before birth. Two gradients in SCN neurogenesis were observed. Posterior cells were produced somewhat earlier than anterior cells and ventrolateral cells were produced before dorsomedial cells. An exception to the second gradient was a small population of ventrolateral cells produced near the end of SCN neurogenesis. The pattern of SCN neurogenesis in the hamster was similar to that described in the rat, including a predominant ventrolateral to dorsomedial gradient and the presence of ventral or ventrolateral cells produced relatively late, contrary to the predominant gradient. © 1990.

AB  - Among the Hausa-Fulani women of Zaria, Nigeria, "cold" or "sanyi" is thought to be a common cause of illnesses, and especially edema (swelling) during pregnancy. The traditional treatment for these illnesses is a hot bath. The new mother or mother-to-be sleeps in an overheated room and must take baths in very hot water, called "wankan- jego," to keep out the cold. The birth attendant uses a bundle of leafy twigs from tamarind or neem trees to splash hot water over the women's body. This splashing hides the real temperature of the hot water over the women's body. This splashing hides the real temperature of the hot water so that she does not feel it, but it may actually be 82 degrees centigrade. Severe scalds often result from, such baths. Women confined during childbirth in the hospital and then discharged are still often subjected to the "wakan-jego" after they return home. Their thighs, buttocks and breasts are the most susceptible areas where these hot-water scald burns are the worst, sometimes even resulting in their nipples being sloughed off, thus making the mother unable to lactate. Since most deliveries in the Zaria region still take place at home and most patients with childbirth complications come to the hospital only as a last resort, it is possible that scald injuries are underreported and the total morbidity and mortality rate may be much higher, both of mothers and babies. Understanding this cultural ritual is necessary to devise effective countermeasures, like encouraging hand testing the bath water for its safety before commencing the baths. Better still, since all the scalded patients in the groups studied were illiterate housewives, formal education could disprove the need for these traditional and harmful hot baths to chase away the "cold" that has been falsely believed to be the cause of childbirth illnesses.

AB  - Infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly now account for 20% of all infant deaths in England and Wales, and the incidence shows no sign of falling. Recent work relating sudden infant death to a raised environmental temperature and a raised body temperature, implicates fever as a possible contributory cause of death; some infants may be unable to control their febrile response to infection, or to thermoregulate effectively, when well wrapped and heated. Death might then result from apnoea, occurring in a critical sleep state. These ideas have increased the interest in describing the normal practices of parents in caring for the environment of their infants in health and disease, and the effect of their behaviour on the child's temperature. Studies of these areas depend on collecting and interpreting data from young children during their day to day lives, and present a challenge of great relevance to primary care research.

AB  - The number of neurons expressing vasopressin (AVP) was determined in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus of 41 human subjects ranging in age from 27 weeks of gestation up to 30 years of age. At term, i.e. at 38-42 weeks of gestation, the fetal SCN is still immature, since it then contains only about 13% of the adult number of AVP-expressing neurons. The period of rapid increase in the number of AVP-staining neurons in the SCN during the first few months postnatally coincides with the appearance of overt diurnal rhythms in the child. © 1990.

AB  - Studies indicate that sleep is disturbed throughout the maternity cycle. The sleep disturbance, leading to reduced sleep time, has been associated with a variety of physical, behavioral, and psychological problems. When these are superimposed on the normal pregnancy and child birth, the potential for altered health is increased. Nursing intervention to identify sleep deficit and promote sleep is required at all stages of the maternity cycle. A knowledge of sleep structure and the role of each stage of sleep is a prerequisite in understanding the value of sleep in health.

AB  - We measured cortisol and cortisone in plasma - both total and free - and in saliva during the course of pregnancy and postpartum. Antepartum and postpartum concentrations and morning and afternoon concentrations of both steroids were compared. The mean concentrations of cortisol and cortisone increased towards term and were significantly greater at the end of pregnancy than postpartum, except for free cortisol in plasma in the afternoon. The daily rhythm of both steroids was maintained throughout pregnancy and postpartum. The correlations between salivary and plasma free concentrations of cortisol and cortisone as well as of the sum of cortisol + cortisone were highly significant. The mean concentrations of cortisone in saliva accurately reflected both total and free concentrations in plasma. For cortisol, however, the change of the concentrations in saliva, was somewhat different from that in plasma. Moreover, the mass ratio of plasma free cortisol to salivary cortisol was about 2, whereas for cortisone the ratio was only about 0.5, probably owing to the conversion of cortisol to cortisone by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the salivary gland. Furthermore, the passage of cortisol and cortisone from plasma to saliva should not be regarded as simple diffusion, because in the first half of pregnancy the sum of the concentrations of cortisol + cortisone in saliva significantly exceeded the sum of their free concentrations in plasma.

To this end, the overnight intravenous insulin infusion was evaluated with the artificial pancreas (Biostator). In none of the two clinical conditions and in none of the three gestational stages an increased insulin infusions during the second period of the night was found under the experimental conditions of our study. This finding may we related with the timing of the last food intake.

AB  - A resonance experiment was undertaken to demonstrate that photoperiod regulates birth time by endogenous circadian mechanisms. Pregnant rats were maintained on a standard light-dark (LD) cycle (14L-10D; lights on from 0600 to 2000 hr) or on fixed LD cycles with periods of 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after day 8 of gestation. In these groups, the light phase (2 hr) started between 0600 and 0800 hr or between 1800 and 2000 hr illuminating exclusively (for periods of 24 and 48 hr) or alternatively (for periods of 12 and 36 hr) the hours corresponding to morning (M) or evening (E) of the standard light regimen. At the end of gestation, the general activity was manifested mainly at moments corresponding to the night of the standard regimen in most groups; it was delayed in the two groups lit up exclusively at E hours. In groups receiving light exclusively at M hours, birth times were delayed compared to the deliveries in groups receiving light at E hours only. An intermediate distribution of birth times was observed when M and E hours were stimulated every 12 hr but not every 36 hr. The apparent stability of the diurnal rhythm of activity and the difference in birth time distributions due to the period of light phase indicate that the regulation of birth time by photoperiod is due to a circadian mechanism in rats. This mechanism implicates at least two endogenous systems which are apparently antagonists with regard to birth. © 1990.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to thoroughly review the literature and present a data base of the basic thermoregulatory parameters of the laboratory rat. This review surveys the pertinent papers dealing with various aspects of the thermal biology of the laboratory rat, including: metabolism, thermoneutrality, core and brain temperature, thermal tolerance, thermal conductance and insulation, thermoregulatory effectors (i.e., thermogenesis, peripheral vasomotor tone, evaporation, and behavior), thermal acclimation, growth and reproduction, ontogeny, aging, motor activity and exercise, circadian rhythm and sleep, gender differences, and other parameters. It is shown that many facets of the thermoregulatory system of the laboratory rat are typical to that of most homeothermic species. However, is several instances the rat exhibits unique thermoregulatory responses which are not comparable to other species. © 1990.

AB  - The chronobiologic question is raised whether exercise may be indicated for the pregnant woman as a general prophylactic measure and, if so, whether it should be timed according to rhythms and stage of pregnancy. This question, recently considered by others without chronobiologic focus, is here reviewed against the background of results from ongoing chronobiologic studies of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in pregnancy. During pregnancy, the MESORs and circadian amplitudes of systolic (S), mean arterial (MA) and diastolic (D) BP are correlated with a questionnaire-assessed cardiovascular risk score. Such results were found under noisy ordinary conditions of life without accounting for effects of activity. They are group results, and as such require further work before they can contribute to identifying individuals at high risk in particular need of intervention, such as exercise. The dependence of exercise effects upon circadian rhythms should also prompt the use of rhythmometry at all ages for timing exercise, for gauging its effects and eventually for the optimization of fitness training for the population as well as for peak performance.

AB  - Most of the movements described during the course of gestation have already emerged before 16 weeks, and the presence of diurnal variation in human fetal behavior has been demonstrated from as early as 20 weeks gestation. Up to 26 weeks quiet intervals rarely exceed 5 min. After this age quiet intervals progressively increase in duration so that behavior appears cyclically rather than randomly distributed. Increasing linkage of the state variables results in identifiable fetal behavioral states from around 36 weeks. During the last trimester fetal activities are cycle- or state-dependent, so that prolonged, and often repeated. recording of behavior is necessary before any sinister conclusions can be drawn. © 1990 S.

AB  - Hypothalamic tryptophan (TP), serotonin (5HT) and 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5HIAA), serum tryptophan (free and total), and circulating corticosterone and aldosterone were measured over 24 hr in 60-day-old male rats fed high (60% and low (6% protein diets. The diets were administered during specific stages of rat growth: fetal phase and suckling (when the process of mitosis is most rapid), post-lactation, and from the fetal phase through to the adult stage. In all groups, there was a direct correlation between protein intake and hypothalamic and serum TP levels. Remarkable decreases in the amplitude and mesor of the aldosterone rhythm were observed when the hyperprotein diet was administered in the fetal and suckling phases, or from the fetal phase until the adult stages. The rhythm of the serotonin system was significantly altered by a low protein diet: decreased 5-HT amplitude (low protein diet in the fetal stage and suckling), decreased 5-HT amplitude and deranged S-HIAA rhythm (low protein in the post-lactation period), deranged 5-HIAA rhythm (low protein diet throughout the experiment). Lastly, there was a remarkable increase in the corticosterone mesor in rats administered a low protein diet after weaning and in rats constantly given this diet. Growth was greatly inhibited in these two groups of animals, therefore, it cannot be excluded that the high levels of circulating hormone resulted from their debilitated condition. © 1990 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - The circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol was studied in 10 healthy women every 4 weeks throughout pregnancy. In addition, in 12 women the diurnal patterns of salivary cortisol, serum cortisol, plasma ACTH, plasma CRH and serum progesterone were analysed in late third trimester pregnancy and again 3–5 days after delivery. Salivary cortisol profiles exhibited a clear circadian rhythm during pregnancy with an increase in mean salivary cortisol from the 25th to 28th week onwards reaching concentrations in late pregnancy more than twice as high as in non‐pregnant controls, rapidly returning to normal concentrations after delivery. The coefficient of variation of salivary cortisol profiles decreased in third trimester pregnancy due to a parallel upward shift of cortisol concentrations (40.2 |Mp 3.4%vs 77.6 |Mp 6.6% after delivery, P &gt; 0.01). A diurnal pattern was also found for plasma ACTH and serum cortisol before and after delivery with lower concentrations post‐partum (P &gt; 0.01). In late pregnancy, progesterone concentrations were significantly higher in the evening (930 + 85 nmol/1 vs 813 |Mp 74 nmol/1 at 0900 h, P &gt; 0.01) but showed no diurnal variation post‐partum. Plasma CRH was significantly elevated in late third trimester pregnancy (1.22 |Mp 0.23 μg/1 at 0900 h) but showed no diurnal change (1.30 |Mp 0.28 μg/1 at 1900 h). Moreover, no correlation between the free cortisol increase in late pregnancy and plasma CRH was noted despite a wide range of CRH levels (0‐13‐3.60 μg/1). In contrast, a significant correlation was observed between the serum progesterone increase and the salivary cortisol increase in late pregnancy (r = 0.70, P &gt; 0‐05). These findings demonstrate that placental CRH is not the only regulator of maternal ACTH and cortisol release. Instead, our study suggests that placental CRH has little influence on baseline maternal adrenocortical function in pregnancy. The elevated salivary cortisol levels in pregnancy may be explained by glucocorticoid resistance owing to the antiglucocorticoid action of high progesterone concentrations.

AB  - We have investigated the effect of pinealectomy of the pregnant ewe on the 24-h pattern of fetal breathing activity during late gestation. Fetal breathing movements were recorded during 24-h periods on 18 occasions in 5 pinealectomized ewes and on 24 occasions in 6 pineal-intact ewes 120 and 145 days gestation. All ewes were fed once daily between 1000 and 1300 h and were kept under a light-dark cycle 12:12 h. There was no significant difference in the mean hourly incidence of fetal breathing movements between the pineal-intact (27.2 ± 0.5 min/h) and pinealectomized (25.5 ± 0.6 min/h) groups. However, there was a significant difference in the 24-h profiles of fetal breathing movements in the two groups. The peak incidence of fetal breathing occurred between 1900 and 2000 h in the pineal-intact ewes and between 1200 and 1300 h in the pinealectomized ewes. We conclude that maternal pinealectomy alters the daily pattern of a fetal behavioral pattern and that maternal melatonin may therefore provide the fetus with information about time of day.

AB  - Starting within two hours after birth, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) and heart rate (HR) of 72 newborns were automatically monitored at about 30-min intervals for 48 hours with a Nippon Colin (Komaki, Japan) device at the Hospital General de Galicia, Santiago, Spain. On the basis of questionnaires given to the parents inquiring notably about the medical family history, the newborns were assigned a cardiovascular risk score (CRS). This risk scale was obtained according to the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease, elevated BP or obesity across 2 generations, those of the newborn's parents and grandparents. BP and HR values outside ± 3 standard deviations (SD) from the individual series mean were removed, and the remaining data were used to compute model dependent (circadian rhythm-adjusted mean or MESOR, amplitude and acrophase) and model independent characteristics (arithmetic mean, SD, 90% and 50% ranges, and circadian range, defined as the difference between the highest and lowest means of hourly classes) for the three circulatory variables. A correlation coefficient was computed between each variable and the CRS. Results indicate highly statistically significant correlations between CRS and indices of variability or dispersion, notably circadian range, SD and 90% range of systolic and diastolic BP and HR, and lack on significant correlation between CRS and average values or indices of location (means, MESORS and even 50% ranges). A 48-hr profile for the computation of extent of change of BP and HR shortly after birth could then provide a neonatal index of cardiovascular risk, to be used for the evaluation of the effects of the newborn of intervention on the pregnant women.

AB  - The 24-hour rhythms of food and water consumption of non-fertilized female rats, of pregnant and lactating animals of a conventionally maintained BD IX stock has been determined. The mean food consumption has been found to be, in the same order, 20.6 g/d, 25.3 g/d, and 48.6 g/d, respectively. In the dark the corresponding values were, respectively, 79, 76 and 67.5%. Maximum food consumption of these 3 animal groups were registered between 10.00 p.m. and 02.00 a.m., from 06.00 p.m. to 10.00 p.m., and from 06.00 p.m. to 10.00 p.m., respectively. At first the pattern is unimodal, but it becomes bimodal during pregnancy and lactation. In corresponding time periods the mean water consumption was, respectively, 28.7, 33.8 and 64.7 ml/d. The maxima corresponded to those of food consumption. Food and water consumption was estrous-dependent and decreased significantly in the perinatal phase. During laction the food and water consumption showed a 2-day rhythm, beginning from day 9 onwards.

AB  - Sixty-eight healthy pregnant women measured their blood pressure at home for 1 day every 4 weeks from 14 weeks' gestation until delivery. Blood pressure measurements were made with the Cambridge blood pressure telemetry system, which was composed of a Dinamap 1846 monitor linked to and controlled by a dedicated microprocessor which communicated transtelephonically with a hospital-based microcomputer. On each measurement day each woman measured her blood pressure five times: on first rising and then at 10 Ann, 2 PM, 6 PM and 10 PM. At each measurement session the blood pressure was automatically taken 10 times at 1-minute intervals. A total of 23,790 individual blood pressure measurements were analyzed. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures were lowest at 18 weeks' gestation, rising slowly thereafter at a rate of 0.4 mm Hg systolic and 0.2 mm Hg diastolic per week. The maternal pulse rate also increased steadily after 18 weeks at a rate of 0.25 beats/min per week. There was a strong correlation between the blood pressures at 18, 26, and 38 weeks. All blood pressure parameters were significantly lower on first rising than at other times of the day, although the differences were small: 5 mm Hg for systolic, 4 mm Hg for mean arterial, and 3 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. After 10 Ann, however, there was no significant daytime variation in any blood pressure parameter, indicating that for most purposes the time of day at which pressure measurements are made is unimportant. © 1990, Mosby.

AB  - The circadian and pulsatile secretions of prolactin were studied in 15 pregnant and 5 puerperal women. Blood samples were taken every 15 minutes for 3 hours during daytime and at night. Diurnal levels of prolactin and estradiol were examined in 135 pregnant women. In addition, prolactin and estradiol of 8 parturient women were measured every 15 minutes until 24 hours after delivery. Prolactin and estradiol levels increased gradually in advance of pregnancy, and a positive correlation was revealed between prolactin(Y) and gestational weeks(X): Y = 7.125X-42.997, r = 0.9955. Furthermore, a positive correlation between prolactin(Y) and estradiol(X) levels was observed: Y = 4.439X + 44.115, r = 0.7590. The circadian secretion of prolactin was observed in 15 out of 20 cases studied. The pulsatile secretion of prolactin was revealed in all 20 cases. The daytime pulse-frequency significantly decreased in the 2nd trimester and that of the nighttime also decreased in the 3rd trimester. The pulse-amplitude increased in advance of pregnancy, but amplitude/baseline value ratio was stationary 28% during the daytime and 34% during the nighttime in every trimester of pregnancy. 63.0% of coincidence in prolactin pulse with increase of immunoreactive LH-hCG was observed. The pulsatile secretion of hCG has not been yet reported. However, the pulsatile increase of immunoreactive LH-hCG was observed in 10 pregnancies, while LH was not detected in any pregnancy by highly specific LH assay. This suggested that immunoreactive hCG changed in a pulsatile manner in the blood of pregnant subjects. A highly significant decline of prolactin levels was observed from 10 hours before until 4 hours after delivery, which did not correlate with changes of estradiol levels. These results indicated that the pulsatility and circadian secretion of prolactin were preserved during pregnancy and puerperium and also suggested that prolactin secretion during pregnancy, delivery and puerperium was regulated by at least 3 factors: estradiol, dopamine and LH-hCG.

AB  - There is a diurnal variation in the mean incidence and amplitude of fetal breathing movements (FBMs) in sheep after ~ 120 days gestation. To determine whether this variation is caused by diurnal fluctuations in plasma glucose or prostaglandin (PG) concentrations, we studied two groups of pregnant sheep fed either once daily at 1100 h or every 2 h for 24 h. Maternal and fetal blood samples were taken every 2 h from 0900 to 0900 h the next day for assay of plasma glucose and PGE2 and PGF(2α) concentrations. FBMs were recorded throughout the 24 h. The mean fetal plasma glucose concentrations of the once-daily and multifed groups were not different, but there was a significant difference between the two groups in the 24-h pattern of fetal glucose concentrations. In the once-daily fed group, plasma glucose concentrations reached a peak 8 h after maternal feeding and then declined, whereas in the multifed group, fetal plasma glucose concentrations reached a plateau and were constant from 1300 to 0900 h the next day. Fetal plasma PGE2 and PGF(2α) concentrations did not show a significant change with time of day in either group. There was a significant diurnal variation in the incidence and amplitude of FBMs in each of the two feeding groups, and the 24-h pattern of FBMs did not differ significantly between groups. Therefore it would appear that the diurnal variation of FBMs is not a consequence of the maternal feeding regimen or diurnal changes in plasma glucose or PG concentrations.

AB  - In western societies a high frequency of heartburn, nausea and vomiting occur during pregnancy. The causes and mechanisms of these clinical symptoms remain poorly understood. Evidence suggests steroid hormones modulate gastrointestinal transit time and plasma peptide hormones, while peptide hormone modulated food intake and preferences. Since diurnal and episodic release of steroid and peptide hormones occur, it is postulated that heartburn and other digestive dysfunction during pregnancy are associated with elevated steroid and peptide (β-endorphin, NPY) hormone interaction with innate biological rhythms controlling the gastrointestinal tract. © 1990.

AB  - It is now well established that during the second half of normal pregnancy, the human placenta secretes its specific GH variant (placental GH) in increasing amounts up to delivery. During the same period, pituitary GH secretion is progressively suppressed. The present study was aimed at clarifying the physiology of GH secretion in pregnant acromegalic women. Two young women remained acromegalic despite transsphenoidal removal of their pituitary adenoma. Increased basal levels of GH and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) as well as paradoxical GH release after TRH injection were noted. Both women became pregnant and delivered term babies without any complication. In both patients, pituitary GH remained elevated during the entire pregnancy, contrary to the situation in normal women. Paradoxical GH release after TRH treatment was also present, whereas no response was observed in five normal control subjects. GH pulsatility studies revealed a highly pulsatile secretory pattern of pituitary GH, in contrast to that in normal woman, whose placental GH is secreted tonically. Tissue placental GH concentrations were within the range of levels in normal placentas. An increase in serum IGF-I in late pregnancy was also similar to that observed in normal pregnancy. These findings confirm that increased IGF-I levels are not pituitary GH dependent in late pregnancy. They add new evidence that adenomatous somatotrophs lack an IGF-I-dependent feedback regulation present in normal somatotrophs. © 1990 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The spontaneous behavior of rat fetuses (in a saline bath with fetal-placental-uterine connections intact) was observed directly for 30 minutes on Day 20 of gestation. Rearleg and nonrearleg movements from fetuses with a mid-thoracic spinal cord transection or sham operation were analyzed for cyclic organization. Oscillations in rearleg activity occurred at the same frequency in fetuses with spinal cord transections (0.74 cycle/min) and sham-operated fetuses (0.72 cycle/min). However, oscillations in nonrearleg activity were much slower in the fetuses with spinal cord transections (0.30 vs. 0.77 cycle/min). Other characteristics of the cyclic patterns in motor activity were unaffected. The findings demonstrate 1) the caudal half of the spinal cord can generate cyclic output in the absence of descending input from the brain, 2) there is no single timing center, and 3) rostral sources are slower. © 1990.

AB  - Timing of insemination in a seminatural environment had a significant, curvilinear relationship with the secondary sex ratio of litters conceived during cycling estrus. When fifth inseminations were received prior to 2.75 h after dark onset, there was a steady decline in the sex ratio as time between dark onset and fifth insemination increased. Fifth inseminations received after 2.75 h resulted in a moderate rise in the sex ratio. This curvilinear relationship was also found with artificial insemination, indicating that neither copulatory behavior nor the vaginal environment were necessary for the association. For postpartum litters there was a linear decline in sex ratio as the interval between dark onset and fifth insemination increased; however, there was no subsequent rise in sex ratio with late inseminations. Season of conception and parity of the dam were associated with sex ratio; litter size and estrous condition were not. Feasibility of the rat as an animal model for sex determination in humans is discussed. © 1990.

AB  - The concentrations of progesterone (P), relaxin (Rlx), estradiol (E2) and PRL were measured by specific RIAs in serum samples collected twice daily at 8:00 am and 3:00 pm at weekly intervals after mating and until whelping in five Labrador Retriever bitches. From weeks 3 to 6 of pregnancy, P exhibited a conspicuous and statistically significant diurnal pattern (P < 0.05), its serum concentration being approximately twice as high at 8:00 am as at 3:00 pm. A similar but nonsignificant trend was observed weeks 2, 7, and 8, and the overall ratio of the am/pm P concentrations was 2.4 ± 0.28 (P < 0.001). Rlx, E2, and PRL did not show a diurnal pattern at any time during pregnancy. The glandular sources and regulation of secretion of Rlx were further investigated. Rlx bioactivity was detected in canine placentas and ovaries, providing supportive evidence that these organs may be a dual source of the hormone in canine pregnancy. Injection of ovine PRL in three pseudopregnant bitches significantly increased serum P concentration as compared with seven untreated pseudopregnant controls, but Rlx was not detectable in serum before, during or after PRL treatment. The data support the view that Rlx and P are independently regulated in the bitch; PRL may be a regulator of P, but not of Rlx secretion. However, as PRL showed no diurnal changes in concentration, it does not appear to be directly responsible for the diurnal pattern exhibited by P. © 1990 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Milk production and the duration of lactation were compared between control rabbits nursing their own pups and those whose litters were replaced by younger, i.e., 4-6 days old, or older pups (20-23 days old) starting at pp days 4, 10 or 15. In rabbits whose pups were exchanged on pp day 4 by older pups, an early decline of milk secretion was induced and similar yields to those of late-lactating controls were produced during mid lactation. Conversely, yields similar to those of mid-lactating controls were produced in late-lactating mothers nursing young pups continuously since pp day 10 and high yields were maintained in these animals until pp day 45. When litter exchanges, by either older or younger pups, were delayed until pp day 15, yields were not significantly different from controls. These results indicate that qualitative changes in suckling stimulation develop as the litter grows older, i.e., young pups stimulate milk secretion, whereas old pups inhibit it. Thus, suckling itself may determine the overall pattern of milk secretion in these species. © 1990.

AB  - It is well known that stress in a number of forms induces the secretion of prolactin (PRL) in a number of species. What is not well known is that under certain conditions stress will also induce a decrease in PRL secretion. The conditions whereby stress decreases PRL are those where PRL secretion is elevated such as during the proestrous afternoon surge and during the nocturnal surge of pseudopregnancy. The physiologic significance of the stress-induced increase of PRL is suggested to be important in maintaining the competence of the immune system. The significance of the stress-induced decrease of PRL does not appear to have a major consequence on the physiology of reproduction in the rat and it is suggested that future studies be directed towards its significance in the immune system. The literature is reviewed dealing with the regulation of PRL secretion with emphasis on the factors that generate PRL surges in the rat. In addition the mechanism(s) of the stress-induced increase and decrease is (are) also examined. A hypothesis is presented suggesting an interaction between tuberoinfundibular dopamine secretion and a hypothalamic prolactin releasing factor in the generation of PRL surges and the differential effects of stress on PRL secretion. © 1990.

AB  - Free amino acids and indoles were measured by HPLC in single pineal glands of 5‐, 10‐and 20‐day‐old rats sacrificed during mid‐light and mid‐dark at each age. Melatonin was detectable in neonates (5‐day‐old), but day vs night differences in indole constituents did not occur until 10 days of age. Free amino acid steady state levels were high in neonates and there was a tendency for reversal of day vs night differences coinciding with the onset of circadian rhythmicity in indole biosynthesis. High correlations (r > 0.85) existed for taurine vs. glutamate in individual glands regardless of age and time of sacrifice. These findings suggest that taurine and glutamate are biochemically interrelated and that developmental changes in amino acid metabolic pools reflect functional innervation of the gland.

AB  - Maternal exercise resulted in an increase in fetal heart rate and variability in normal fetuses. In small fetuses there was a variable response, with four of 20 fetuses having sharp decelerations in heart rate with maternal exercise. A rise in maternal core temperature resulted, in all cases, in a rise in maternal heart rate. In normal fetuses the fetal heart rate also rose by on average 12·2 beats per min per degree Celsius. In small for dates fetuses there was no significant change in mean fetal heart rate, with three of 11 fetuses having decelerations in heart rate with increased maternal temperature. Circadian variation seen in fetal heart rates was similar to that occurring in the mother (r = 0·49, P < 0·05). There was no demonstrable circadian variation in neonatal heart rate (r= -0.24). This suggests that the fetal heart rate variation is extrinsic in origin. © 1990 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - Total and free cortisol levels are significantly elevated in pregnancy, but the reasons for this are not clear. The relationships between the diurnal variation in saliva (free) cortisol and baseline levels of total cortisol, corticosterone-binding globulin (CBG), progesterone, and estrogens were studied in several groups of women (normal nonpregnant, taking a combined oral contraceptive pill, after superovulation therapy, during early and late pregnancy, and postpartum). Saliva cortisol levels were significantly elevated in late pregnancy throughout the day, with preservation of diurnal variation. Total cortisol and CBG levels were also significantly raised in pregnancy, but total cortisol levels were normal in women taking a combined oral contraceptive pill in spite of significantly elevated CBG. There was no relationship between saliva cortisol and progesterone levels, and it is unlikely that the increase in cortisol is due to displacement of cortisol from CBG by progesterone. Cortisol levels fell slowly postpartum over several days, making it improbable that the increase in cortisol is solely due to elevated CRH levels. It appears that increased free and total cortisol levels in pregnancy are related to resetting of the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and not merely to raised CBG, progesterone, or CRH levels. © 1990 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - We determined the effect of a 6-hour phase shift in the light-dark cycle on the 24-hour rhythm of myometrial activity with 15 chronically catheterized pregnant rhesus monkeys during the last third of gestation. Monkeys were housed indoors in constant temperature on a 14-hour-light/10-hour-dark photoperiod in two groups based on the time the lights were turned on (group A lights on at 6 am and group B lights on at midnight). The power spectra were calculated for periods of 512 readings (1.138 hours) starting at the time the lights were turned on for continuous periods of 25.03 hours of data showing well-developed contraction-type activity at any time during that period. The power spectra data for contractures and contractions were analyzed separately from myometrial electromyographic data. During the 14 hours of light, myometrial activity was primarily composed of contractures. In all experimental animals the switch from contractures to contractions occurred around the time the lights were turned off. The proportion of contraction-type activity in each 1.138-hour analysis interval expressed as a percentage of the total contraction power for the whole 25.03-hour analysis period for all monkeys increased around the time the lights were turned off in both groups. The increase in contractions was observed 12 to 15 hours after the lights were turned on. No systematic change in the proportion of contracture activity was observed. Peak contraction activity was 22.6 ± 0.60 hours (16.6 hours after lights on), and was at 18.3 ± 1.4 hours (18.31 hours after lights on) in groups A and B, respectively. This difference was statistically significant (22.6 ± 0.6 vs 18.3 ± 1.4 hours, p < 0.05). Seven of eight monkeys in group A and six of seven in group B had switched from contractures to contractions before lights were turned off. We have confirmed a 24-hour rhythm in myometrial activity in the pregnant rhesus monkey and provided new evidence to support the endogenous nature of this rhythm and its direct relationship to the light-dark cycle. © 1990.

AB  - The contribution to risk by genetics is a primary factor for the predisposition of a newborn to elevated blood pressure (BP) later in life. An index for this factor is needed to assess, on the neonate, the success or failure of preventive interventions instituted on the pregnant women (such as dietary supplements of calcium and/or magnesium, weight control, etc., to which the family history obviously cannot respond). This index could be based on characteristics of BP and heart rate (HR) variability during the first two days after birth. In the search for such an index, the systolic and diastolic BP and HR of 72 newborns were automatically monitored at about 30-min intervals for 48 hrs with a Nippon Colin (Komaki, Japan) device, starting within two hours after birth. Circadian chronobiologic characteristics and descriptive statistics for the three circulatory variables were used in a multiple regression analysis to compute a linear prediction function for a cardiovascular risk score (CRS). This discrete variable was obtained for each neonate on the basis of the presence or absence of overt cardiovascular disease, elevated BP or obesity across 2 generations of his family. Results from regression indicate that the best model includes the circadian amplitudes of systolic and diastolic BP and the circadian range of HR. The linear model was then used to predict the CRS for a new group of 26 neonates. The correlation between the CRS computed from the model and obtained from the family history of each of those 26 newborns is .918 (P < .001). These results represent a step forward, whereby the effects of possible interventions during pregnancy upon the risk of the development of high BP can be assessed immediately after birth, to indicate those in need for further consideration of primary preventive measures.

AB  - PRL secretion in several physiological and experimental conditions, including early pregnancy, is linked to the daily photoperiod. The aim of this study was to examine the antepartum increase in PRL secretion for evidence of a circadian pattern of release, as seen during early pregnancy. During the last 3 days of pregnancy blood samples were taken six times daily by means of previously implanted jugular cannulae. Plasma PRL concentrations were then measured by RIA.PRL levels were less than 10 ng/ml in all animals on day 19 of pregnancy, but during the light period of day 20 there was an increase to an average of 30 ± 10 ng/ml, with no evidence of a peak related to the time of day. However, in the dark period between days 20 and 21 there was a large surge of PRL secretion which reached peak levels of 356 ± 39 ng/ml at 0500 h on day 21, then returned to 48 ± 20 ng/ml at 1200 h, around the time of parturition. The peak always occurred at 0500 h and was not related to the time of parturition, which ranged from 1000-2200 h on day 21. Bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) on day 19 advanced the time of delivery by approximately 12 h. In seven of nine animals, no surge of PRL secretion was observed during the dark period preceding parturition. Estradiol treatment after OVX on day 19 (OVX+E) advanced the time of delivery by approx 18 h. An antepartum PRL surge was present and was advanced by 24 h in all OVX+E animals, peaking at 0300 h on day 20. Progesterone treatment from day 18 to 21 in intact pregnant animals delayed parturition by approximately 18 h and prevented PRL secretion during the period of treatment. After progesterone treatment was stopped, a nocturnal surge of PRL secretion occurred, peaking at 0500 h on day 22, 24 h after the surge in normal animals.The results suggest that the increased PRL secretion during late pregnancy is linked to the daily photoperiod and is characterized by a nocturnal surge in the dark period preceding parturition. This surge is inhibited by progesterone, and it can be advanced 24 h by estradiol treatment in the absence of the ovaries. © 1990 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The present study describes daily and seasonal variations in the discrimination capacities of mothers in relation to their newborn's odour and olfactory detection thresholds of a non specific molecule (thiophene) by mothers. The tests are carried out during the 2nd, 4th and 6th days after the parturition. The results show that the abilities of the mothers to discriminate the odours of their newborn increase gradually from the morning to the evening, with the exception of the second part of the 4th day when the mothers' performances decrease between 05:30 P.M. and 08:00 P.M. This daily variation is not observed in olfactory thresholds of mothers in relation to thiophene as they decrease between 08:00 A.M. and 01:30 P.M. and increase between 01:30 P.M. and 08:00 P.M. for the three days of test. Nevertheless, seasons seem to have the same effect about the two types of mothers' performances. The results suggest that the variations in the abilities of the mothers to discriminate the corporeal odour of their newborn and the variations of their olfactory thresholds for a non specific odour are based on different biological and psychobiological mechanisms.

AB  - The sugar replacer isomalt was fed to Wistar rats of both sexes throughout three successive generations at concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5 and 10% in the diet. A group of rats fed a diet containing 10% sucrose served as an additional control group. The initial mating was of 100 rats of each sex in each group. For subsequent matings 20 rats of each sex from each group were used. For each generation two litters were reared until they were at least 3 wk old. Feeding isomalt to rats for three successive generations did not induce any adverse effects on fertility, reproductive performance or development compared with control animals fed diets containing maize starch and sucrose instead of isomalt. The second litter of third-generation rats was given detailed gross and microscopic examinations 4 wk after weaning. A marked treatment-related change was an increase in the relative weight of the caecum (filled and empty), 4 wk after weaning in the second litter of third-generation rats fed 10% isomalt. There was also an increase in the relative weight of the filled caecum in males of the 5% isomalt group. These findings were not accompanied by diarrhoea or histological changes in the caecum. The results of the present study did not demonstrate any deleterious effects on the reproduction, maternal performance or development of rats fed isomalt at dietary levels of up to 10% over three successive generations. © 1990.

AB  - A method has been developed to monitor bone resorption (BR) based on the urinary excretion of [3H]tetracycline ([3H]TC) from chronically prelabeled rats. This is possible because the [3H]TC released from bone has been found to be in a form that is not or only poorly bound to apatite and thus reincorporated into newly formed bone. When BR was increased by means of dietary calcium restriction, parathyroid hormone (PTH) infusion, or retinoid injections, urinary [3H]TC doubled. When BR was inhibited by feeding calcium supplements or administration of dichloromethylenebisphosphonate, [3H]TC excretion dropped by two-thirds. Thyroparathyroidectomy inhibited [3H]TC excretion by one-third. The results obtained with this technique are therefore similar to those obtained with other methods such as 45Ca kinetics. The effect of dietary manipulations on BR was detected within 6 h of changing diet. Furthermore, a strong diet-dependent but PTH- and calcitonin-independent diurnal rhythm in BR was found. By use of this technique, bone resorption can be assessed continuously over long periods, and the acute regulation of bone resorption can be studied for the first time.

AB  - To evaluate the possible effect of the extreme and permanent changes in the hormonal milieu and in the lighting conditions at birth on the pineal hormone, melatonin (MT), we measured maternal vein and umbilical artery concentrations of MT in 19 parturients, post‐partum urinary concentrations of MT in 14 mothers and their infants, and daytime (0800‐2000 h) and night‐time (2000‐0800 h) urinary concentrations of MT and 6‐sulphatoxymelatonin in 22 infants during the first 8 days of life. The mean MT concentrations in maternal venous blood and umbilical arterial blood did not differ significantly from each other and there was a positive correlation between them. The same was true for postpartum urinary MT of the mothers and their infants. There was no diurnal rhythm of MT during the first week of life. MT excretion in neonates was 2‐5 pmol/12 h (only 1‐5% in comparison with adults) and that of 6‐sulphatoxymelatonin 150‐300 pmol/12 h. In reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) studies, 84‐100% of total MT immunoreactivity was eluted at the same position as synthetic MT, and a small amount of hydrophobic MT‐like immunoreactive material was also detected in five of the 10 urine extracts studied. This material (perhaps a novel neonatal metabolite of MT) may be indicative of immaturity of neonatal metabolism of MT although 6‐hydroxylation is also functional in neonates. Although infant MT immediately after delivery at least partly reflects maternal MT secretion, our results show that the pineal gland is capable of producing MT at this time. However, the diurnal rhythm of MT is not yet developed, possibly because of the inability of the pineal gland to react to external stimuli at this stage, or because increased secretion of gonadotrophins after delivery suppresses the pineal gland.

AB  - No currently available single test of fetal well-being is a universal, infallible clinical tool that stands apart from the more general context of the total pregnancy. It is tempting to place a substantial emphasis on the results of a test when medical decision-making is needed. Perhaps some sense of proportion should be invoked at this point, beginning with the recognition that fetal heart rate data, regardless of how they are obtained, provide a limited window to view the fetus and its environment. The fact remains that the relatively low incidence of real fetal compromise and subsequent poor outcomes biases the efficacy of the NST and other well-being tools. Most high-risk populations have a prevalence of poor outcomes of approximately 10 per cent; consequently, the target population for any assessment test is quite small. One must be reassured by the extremely large reported experience of Platt et al40 that nonstress testing is clinically useful in the overwhelming majority of cases. The NST appears to be an excellent predictor of the healthy fetus. The test is very good at predicting the fetus who does not require acute or premature obstetric intervention; it thereby prevents pregnancies from being subjected to unnecessary iatrogenic risks and from incurring tremendous medical and emotional costs. Can the NST be improved? I think that there is still considerable opportunity for making this test more effective and accurate. Our experience supports the concepts of standardized testing conditions, the use of baseline data in addition to reactivity alone, the prolongation of test sessions to achieve a more representative view of the fetus, and ultimately an automated analysis that will aid the clinician in making more reliable assessments of the fetal heart rate data present in the actual tracing. It would be useful to see the NST better integrated into management schemes that incorporate other assessment techniques as well as pertinent clinical data. The tendency to view the test as a ''stand alone'' modality has underscored weaknesses inherent in all surveillance methods that have a naturally limited perspective on complex developmental and adaptive problems. There is also a need for the development of academic standards so that collected experiences can be directly compared and communication of testing results made less ambiguous. These are some of the goals that should be set for the future and whose realization will effect better care for the unique population served by obstetricians.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the levels of progesterone and hCG and the variability of those levels over 24 h in early pregnancy. Venous blood sampling was performed every 30 min during the first trimester of a subsequently normal pregnancy in 19 women. The variability in each progesterone and hCG data series was evaluated by three methods: 1) comparing the coefficient of variation (CV) of each individual hormone data set to the respective assay CV, 2) examining each data set for pulses, and 3) relating changes in hormone levels to the ingestion of a meal. The CV for each individual progesterone data set was greater than the assay CV (CVprogesterone 3.7%) in all subjects (range, 5.58–21.90%). The CV for each individual hCG data set was greater than the assay CV for hCG (CVhCG, 4.3%) in 17 of 19 subjects (range, 3.27–10.95%). Mean (±se) progesterone and hCG peak frequencies were 2.4 ± 0.3 and 1.7 ± 0.3/24 h, respectively. When postprandial levels of progesterone were normalized to a percentage of preprandial levels, there were maximum decreases in mean progesterone levels of 15.4 ± 2.6% and 13.1 ± 1.9% 1 h after initiation of the lunch and dinner meals, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Postprandial hCG levels decreased by 2.3 ± 1.9% and 0.4 ± 1.6% during this same time period (P &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that 1) both progesterone and hCG levels fluctuate during a 24-h period in early pregnancy; 2) this variability of both hormones is greater than inherent assay variability and can be resolved into a short term pattern of pulses, suggesting alterations in episodic secretion, metabolic clearance, or volume of distribution of the hormone; and 3) a portion of the variability in the progesterone time set may be due to the ingestion of meals. © 1990 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Individual variations in serum lipid concentrations resulting from laboratory error are often much less than those due to other factors. Thus the coefficient of variation for biological fluctuations in cholesterol is 5 - 10% and for triglyceride concentration 5-25% Many of the causes of changing lipid levels are known. Sampling conditions (venous stasis, body position) contribute as does the handling of the blood sample before it reaches the laboratory, for example whether an anticoagulant is used and haemolysis, clearly meals have a major effect on serum triglycerides, but even when fasting there is probably also diurnal variation. Fluctuations in serum lipids occur during the menstrual cycle, cholesterol and triglycerides tending to be highest at midcycle and to decline towards menstruation. Pregnancy produces major increases in both cholesterol and triglyceride levels. There is a well established seasonal variation in cholesterol concentrations which are greatest in autumn and lowest in late spring and early summer. This may be partly due to nutritional changes, but similar findings in laboratory animals suggest that humoral factors may also be important. Age also influences serum lipids. It is frequently not appreciated that both cholesterol and triglycerides are at their lowest in adolescence. Rapid increases in cholesterol may occur in women around the menopause. Lipid concentrations may undergo considerable change during illness. The decrease in LDL and HDL cholesterol and apo B and tendency for increases in triglycerides during acute myocardial infarction are well known but similar alterations can also occur with angina or coronary artery bypass surgery. Other surgical operations and intercurrent illnesses, perhaps even common viral infections, may also influence lipids. Drugs especially antihypertensive agents and anticonvulsants change lipid levels and so also may industrial and nutritional exposure to chemicals. Appreciation of the sources and scale of fluctuations in serum lipids is essential for those involved in patient care, screening, evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors and research, particularly case-control studies. © 1990 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - We have monitored the 24-h profiles of plasma melatonin concentrations between birth and 10 weeks of age, in lambs which were delivered to, and suckled, either pineal-intact (control group) or pinealectomized (pinealectomized group) ewes. Between 0 and 2 weeks of age, plasma concentrations of melatonin in lambs suckling either intact or pinealectomized ewes were highest at 01.00 h. At this age, however, there was no significant difference in the mean plasma concentrations of melatonin between the entire dark and light phases in lambs in either the control group (dark, 39.7 ± 6.0 (S.E.M.) pmol/l; light, 39.5 ± 8.1 pmol/l) or the pinealectomized group (dark, 79.8 ± 43.3 pmol/l; light, 60.9 ± 8.7 pmol/l). Between 3 and 4 weeks of age, however, a diurnal rhythm in plasma melatonin concentrations was clearly present in the lambs in both the control and pinealectomized groups (control group: dark, 164.1 ± 5.6 pmol/l; light, 26.2 ± 2.5 pmol/l; pinealectomized group: dark, 52.7 ± 8.0 pmol/l; light, 19.1 ± 5.3 pmol/l; P < 0.001). Between 3 and 10 weeks of age, plasma concentrations of melatonin in the dark phase were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the lambs suckling pinealectomized ewes than in the control group. In both the control lambs and lambs suckling pinealectomized ewes, the mean plasma concentrations of melatonin in the dark and light phases increased significantly (P < 0.05) between 3 and 6 weeks after birth. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a clear diurnal plasma rhythm in melatonin concentrations does not emerge until 3-4 weeks of age in lambs suckling either pinealectomized or intact ewes. We have also measured lower melatonin concentrations during the dark phase in lambs suckling pinealectomized ewes when compared with lambs suckling pineal-intact ewes between 3 and 10 weeks of age.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the endocrine changes that occur during the reinstatement of the ovulatory cycles after lactational infertility in the rat. Hormonal patterns and specific binding of [125I]FSH to ovaries of lactating rats that kept their pups (LRP) or were separated from their pups on day 13 postpartum (LRX) were studied on days 13-16 postpartum. In LRP rats gonadotropin levels remained low and unvarying throughout the experiment; PRL levels were high in the morning, low at 1300 h, and then surged in the afternoon. Estradiol levels were very low in LRP rats in serum as well as in ovarian homogenates, and progesterone levels decreased gradually from days 13 to 16. No changes in either receptor number or dissociation constants (Kd) were observed in [125I]FSH binding to ovaries of LRP rats. In LRX rats, LH peaked on the afternoon of day 15 (P &lt; 0.05). FSH decreased from morning levels on day 13 to morning levels on day 15, and then peaked at 1600 h on day 15 (p &lt; 0.05). PRL decreased rapidly (day 13 1600 h levels significantly lower than day 13 1100 h levels), then remained low and peaked on the afternoon of day 15 (P &lt; 0.05). In LRX rats progesterone levels decreased more markedly than in LRP rats and then surged in the afternoon of day 15. Serum estradiol levels rose significantly in the morning of day 15, while ovarian homogenate estradiol titers had already risen on the morning of day 14. Significant increases in number of [125I]FSH-binding sites and Kd values were observed in LRX rats on day 15 postpartum. These results clearly show that litter removal at midlactation (day 13) induces the reinstatement of hormonal cyclicity, and this is accompanied by changes in ovarian FSH receptors. © 1990 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Delay in fetal maturation in diabetic and accelerated fetal maturation in hypertensive pregnancies have been reported in the past. The spontaneous activity of fetal nervous system during pregnancy was followed longitudinally in a group of 29 normal pregnancies from 28th to 40th week of gestation by means of fetal behavioural states determination. If state (quiet sleep) progressively increases from median values of 5.0% to values of 22.5-25% at term of pregnancy. This state represents the positive activity of inhibitory centers and has been related to a positive evolutionary process of brain maturation according to preceding experiences conducted on experimental models and preterm babies followed with EEG and direct observation in the early neonatal period. The method of behavioural states determination has been applied to a group of 33 gestational diabetes (GDM) pregnant women followed longitudinally, and a clear reduction of development of 1F state has been evidentiated, with significant differences (p<0.001) at 35-36 weeks of gestation versus the control group. The normal values are reached in concomitance with L/S value of maturity. In 30 pregnant women affected by gestational hypertension (GH) different result are obtained: 1F state seems to develop earlier, and is increased (p<0.001) around 30-32 weeks versus the control group if a fetal growth reduction is present. The value of 1F behavioural state in the evaluation of fetal condition of pathological pregnancies is discussed.

AB  - Documented studies have indicated that sleep loss occurs in women during the third trimester of pregnancy. This study quantified the third trimester and intrapartal sleep of 28 primigravid women to identify the relationship between sleep loss and the presence of anxiety, hostility, and depression on the first postpartum day. The study sample reported an increase in third‐trimester sleep but significant intrapartal sleep loss. A computation of Pearson's correlation coefficient indicated no significant relationship between sleep loss and moods of anxiety, hostility, and depression. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - The contribution of the uterus to the regulation of PRL secretion in lactating dams and cycling female rats was investigated. Lactating animals were hysterectomized or sham operated 2 days after parturition, and the number of pups was adjusted to eight. Blood samples for PRL RIA were obtained through intra-atrial cannulae implanted 2 days before experimentation. In order to study the PRL secretory profile in undisturbed freely lactating rats, blood samples were taken every 2 h for 24 h starting at 1400 h. During early lactation (days 7-8), hysterectomy did not alter the PRL secretory profile compared to that of sham-operated controls. On days 14-15 post partum, PRL secretion followed a characteristic bimodal pattern showing two PRL surges at 1800 h and 0600 h. After hysterectomy, the early morning PRL surge disappeared and PRL secretion showed an unimodal daily rhythm reaching its peak at 1800 h. The possible effect of the absence of the uterus on suckling-induced PRL release at various stages of lactation was studied. On days 7-8, suckling stimuli after 4 h of pup deprivation induced robust PRL release. Hysterectomy did not significantly alter PRL release at this earlier stage of lactation. In control groups, the suckling-induced PRL secretory response markedly declined as the postpartum period advanced. On the other hand, the hysterectomized animals retained significantly greater responsiveness to suckling during the second half of lactation. These data indicate an inhibitory influence of the uterus on PRL secretion. The onset of this uterine effect is considerably delayed, and its influence became prominent only at a later phase of lactation. The effect of length of pup deprivation preceding the suckling stimulus, in combination with hysterectomy, was also investigated. Hysterectomy significantly increased suckling-induced PRL release after 4 and 24 h separation compared to the sham-hysterectomized animals. When the separation was longer than 48 h, the inducibility of PRL release by suckling declined and was not influenced by hysterectomy. In order to study the possible influence of the uterus on PRL secretion during the estrous cycle, regularly cycling female rats were hysterectomized at diestrus 1. Twelve days later the animals were cannulated, and serial blood samples were taken during the subsequent proestrus. Hysterectomy did not alter the PRL surge which occurred on the afternoon of proestrus indicating that the uterus does not have a major function in regulating PRL secretion on proestrus. In conclusion, hysterectomy significantly delayed the extinction of suckling-induced PRL release revealing the active role of the uterus in the regulation of this neuroendocrine reflex. © 1990 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Women of all ages have been found to have a higher rate of sleep disturbances than men. Attempts to determine whether hormonal changes marking their reproductive lives render women more vulnerable to emotional stress and to concomitant sleep disturbances are the focus of this article. Investigations of sleep patterns and sleep‐related experiences that occur in connection with the menstrual cycle (normal menstrual cycle and premenstrual syndrome) and are associated with hormonal abnormalities (amenorrhea) and changes in hormonal status (pregnancy and menopause) are reviewed. Methodological problems are discussed and areas of future research are proposed. It is suggested that the triad of sleep, endocrine changes, and mood should be more systematically investigated. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In 16 normal pregnancies the relationship between foramen ovale flow velocity waveforms and fetal behavioral states at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation was studies with Doppler techniques. Foramen ovale flow velocity waveforms are characterized by a typical systolic/diastolic component. Average flow velocity was statistically significantly increased in behavioral state 2F (active sleep) as compared with state 1F (quiet sleep), which was mainly determined by an increase in flow velocity during the end-systolic and passive atrial filling phase. The increase in the average flow velocity at the foramen ovale level during active sleep suggests a redistribution of blood flow at the cardiac level, resulting in an increased right-to-left shunt. © 1990.

AB  - Doppler velocity waveforms from atrioventricular valves were recorded in 20 healthy fetuses at 36-38 weeks of gestation during both behavioural states 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep). No significant changes were found in the ratios between the velocities during early passive ventricular filling and active ventricular filling ( E A ratios) at the level of both mitral and tricuspid valves when the measurements obtained during states 1F and 2F were compared. Moreover, during state 2F the left ventricular output increased and the right ventricular output decreased, resulting in a marked modification of the right to left cardiac output ratio. Our data suggest a redistribution of cardiac output in favour of the left side of the heart during state 2F. © 1990.

AB  - Interactions between sleep and respiration have been noticed in several lung diseases. In COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) patients, the night sleep is delayed or shortened and deep sleep is often reduced or even absent. These disturbances are associated with hypoxaemic episodes occurring either in light slow wave sleep or in REM sleep, the former being short in duration and mild but repetitive and related to ventilatory changes, the latter prolonged, often severe, and resulting from both decrease in ventilation and alterations of ventilation-perfusion ratios. Restrictive syndrome due to interstitial pneumonia, kyphoscoliosis, neuromuscular diseases or, more commonly, to obesity or even pregnancy also alter sleep in a non-specific manner. Most of them result in hypoxia during paradoxical sleep. Unquestionably, there exists a relationship between sleep and asthma (aggravation of dyspnoea at night, reduction of peak expiratory flow when awaking, stage 2 asthmatic attacks). This relationship is probably caused by multifactorial interactions.

AB  - Clonidine is a recommended antihypertensive for use during pregnancy, although little is known of its fetal effects. This study examines the effects of clonidine on breathing and sleep-state cycling in fetal lambs. Clonidine was infused into a fetal lateral ventricle for up to 24 hours at 128 to 135 days' gestation. Control infusions of artificial cerebrospinal fluid had no effect. Clonidine infusion significantly reduced the incidence and episode duration of fetal breathing for the duration of the infusion period. Cycling of electrocortical activity became irregular and rapid, and the incidence of high-voltage electrocortical activity (equivalent to quiet sleep) was reduced. Fetal heart rate decreased but arterial pressure was unaffected. After infusion the breathing incidence and episode duration both increased significantly compared with control, with continuous high-amplitude breathing for several hours, whereas the incidence of high-voltage electrocortical activity remained low. Because lung development is promoted by fetal breathing, long-term use of clonidine during pregnancy could slow lung development by reducing fetal breathing activity. © 1990.

AB  - In 1972, fetal breathing movements were clinically rediscovered. Details of their episodic occurrence, frequency, inspired volume, pleural pressure, and the nearly absolute independence of fetal blood gases were investigated in animal experiments. In the human being, there is also an association between fetal breathing and sleep state: fetal breathing movements were confined almost exclusively to periods of REM sleep. The pattern of respiratory frequency changes as gestation progresses; the rates decrease as term approaches. Hardly and breathing movement can be detected during labor. The fetal respiratory centre is capable of rhythmic movements, but there is a lack of response to basic chemical stimuli from the periphery of the body. The association between fetal breathing and REM sleep implies that the connection between breathing and behaviour is already established before birth; but in the fetus, the link between breathing and metabolism is not yet forged. Throughout postnatal life this linkage predominantly regulates breathing. The difference between fetus and newborn in the reaction to chemical stimuli implies a change at birth related to the glomera cells of the carotid bodies. Under the influence of the marked increase in the sympathetic tone there is a major increase in the sensitivity of the receptor cells to oxygen deficiency immediately after birth.

AB  - The goal of this study was to determine whether rapid eye movement and slow eye movement exist during the eye-movement period in the human fetus in utero. We studied 21 fetuses with real-time ultrasonography, 10 from 33 to 36 weeks and 11 from 37 to 41 weeks' gestation. We used the duration of eye-movement unit as a parameter and calculated the cumulative duration from the shortest to a given duration of eye movement per individual case. A scattergram of cumulative duration versus given duration obtained from all cases in each age group was analyzed with piecewise linear regression to search for a critical point(s). Critical given duration points were noted and reached statistical significance at 0.62 second and at 0.76 second during 33 to 36 and 37 to 40 weeks of gestation, respectively. These findings reveal two different types of eye movement: one with a duration of <0.6 to 0.8 second and the other with a duration of >0.6 to 0.8 second. These findings are compatible with previous criteria on rapid and slow eye movements, respectively, at 33 weeks of gestation onward. The mean value of cumulative duration at the critical point increased from 29.0% between 33 and 36 weeks to 47.1% between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation, indicating an increase in the proportionate amount of time maintaining rapid eye movement as gestation advances. © 1990.

AB  - Alcohol sensitivity may influence the severity of alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). To examine this hypothesis, pregnancy outcome and offspring development were examined in alcohol-sensitive Long-Sleep (LS) mice and alcohol-resistant Short-Sleep (SS) mice following prenatal ethanol exposure. Dams were intragastrically intubated twice per day (6 hr apart) with either 4.5 g/kg (20% w/v) ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of sucrose (S) on days 7 through 18 of pregnancy. An untreated control group (C) was maintained for each line. Results showed litter mortality at 10 days of age was greater for LS-E litters compared to both LS-S and LS-C litters. Litter mortality for SS-E litters did not differ from either SS-S or SS-C litters. Maternal weight gain, blood ethanol levels, and birth weight deficits were similar for ethanol-exposed LS and SS groups. These results suggest genetically based alcohol sensitivity influences the severity of ARBD. © 1990.

AB  - Individual sensitivity to alcohol may influence the severity of functional deficits due to prenatal alcohol exposure. To examine this hypothesis, Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mice, selectively bred for differences in ethanol-induced narcosis, were intubated with either 2.9 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of sucrose (S) twice per day on days 7 through 15 of pregnancy. An untreated control group (C) was maintained for each line. Offspring were fostered to lactating Rockland-Swiss mice at birth. Males and females from each litter were challenged with an acute dose of ethanol (3.8 g/kg) at 30 days of age. Measures of sleep time duration, waking blood ethanol concentrations (BEC), rectal temperatures, heart rate, and ethanol clearance were obtained to examine whether the acute effects of ethanol are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. Prenatal alcohol exposure did not differentially affect responses to ethanol challenge within either genotype. Ethanol-induced hypothermia, heart-rate depression, and sleep time did differ between genotypes, with LS more affected than SS mice. Ethanol clearance rates were faster for SS than LS mice. These results suggest postnatal pharmacological responses to acute ethanol challenge are not altered by prenatal alcohol exposure in LS and SS mice. Prenatal alcohol-exposed offspring of both mouse genotypes showed lower average heart rate responses than controls, suggesting this measure may be a sensitive indicator of prenatal alcohol effects in mice. © 1990.

AB  - In a prospective, blinded study 38 infants of mothers with varying quantities of alcohol ingestion during pregnancy had an EEG at 40 weeks post conceptional age. Bayley Development Tests were administered between 1.5 and 10 months of age. The total power of the EEG during REM sleep was inversely related to subsequent motor development (r = -0.51, F = 13.1, p < 0.0008) whereas the total power of the EEG during quiet sleep was inversely related to subsequent mental development (r = 0.61, F = 24.4, p < 0.0001). In alcohol exposed babies EEG abnormalities were present even in the absence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). In 16 older children born to abstainers or alcoholic mother similar results were obtained. Thus, the power of the EEG during REM and quiet sleep at birth appears to be a sensitive index of alcohol effects on the fetal brain and may be used to predict future motor and mental development.

AB  - Behavioral state-induced changes in fetal cerebral blood flow were continuously monitored with a simple thermal dilution method. Thermojunctions were heated 1.5° C above reference thermojunctions implanted contralaterally in various cerebral cortical and subcortical structures of four near-term fetal sheep. Temperature difference in rapid-eye-movement sleep was lower than in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (p = 0.014), reflecting convective heat loss from increased blood flow. Temperature difference also varied significantly with the locus of placement in the brain (p = 0.003), reflecting, in part, regional differences in cerebral blood flow. The thermocouple method gives qualitative, continuous information on local cerebral blood flow that could be useful in monitoring the vascular response to changing functional activity during prenatal brain development. © 1990.

AB  - The effects of skin-to-skin contact on three indexes of energy expenditure: heart rate, activity level, and behavioral state, were examined in a pilot study. It was hypothesized that skin-to-skin contact, because of its soothing effects, would increase sleep, lower activity level, and reduce heart rate. Eight healthy preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit, who had reached 34 to 36 weeks gestation, experienced one session of skin-to-skin contact for an interfeeding interval. Observations were made once each minute using continuous videotape throughout three consecutive interfeeding intervals (before, during, and after skin-to-skin contact). Significant treatment effects were found by repeated-measures analysis of variance for behavioral state and activity level; pair-wise comparisons showed that quiet sleep frequency was significantly increased and activity level reduced during skin-to-skin contact. Infants had longer durations of quiet sleep during skin-to-skin contact. The Pearson product-moment correlation between heart rate and behavioral state was robust and generally linear, supporting use of heart rate as a measure of energy expenditure in these subjects. The findings suggest that skin-to-skin contact is a simple, cost-effective intervention that reduces activity and state-related energy expenditure.

AB  - Comparisons were made between ultrasound behavioural recordings of 18 healthy term fetuses and recordings of the same variables of the same individuals at 3 to 5 days postnatally. Statistical comparison of the frequency of eye movements, limb and body movements revealed that the fetal states 1F and 2F were comparable to quiet sleep (S1), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (S2), respectively in the newborn. Comparisons between the fetal states and wakefulness were less clear-cut. The heart rate in each of the three states in the fetus was about 20 beats per min higher than in the corresponding postnatal state, although the patterns were similar. States 1F and 2F accounted for a higher percentage of the fetal observations (86%) than states S1 and S2 in the neonatal observations (64%), but the ratio of the different types of sleep was similar in both recordings (30% quiet sleep to 70% REM sleep). State S3 (quiet awake) always and only occurred in the postnatal observations in association with feeding. No comparable behaviour occurred during the prenatal observations (2050 min in 18 fetuses). Numerically the movements observed in S5 (crying) were not significantly different from 2F, however qualitatively there were marked differences, and also S5 was characterized by a heart rate pattern quite unlike anything observed prenatally (often with a rate in excess of 200 beats per min). We postulate that S3 and S5 are postnatal behavioural adaptations to extrauterine existence. © 1990.

AB  - Respiratory control abnormalities are mechanistic in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). In particular, arousal from sleep is an important component of respiratory regulation. Cocaine alters central neurotransmitter metabolism, particularly the monoamines. The locus coeruleus, the major Norepinephrine (NE) neuronal system, is involved in arousal from sleep related apnea and has extensive forebrain and brainstem projections. Thus, it is plausible that in utero cocaine exposure disrupts the normal maturation of transmitters and/or brain structures essential to sleep related respiratory regulation. Infants exposed to cocaine in utero may have an increased incidence of SIDS. We propose that cocaine use in pregnancy alters the normal maturation of centers and/or neurotransmitters involved in respiratory regulation thereby altering postnatal respiratory control. We hypothesize that the increased incidence of SIDS in cocaine exposed infants may be secondary to deficits in arousal. The study of prenatal brain development and of postnatal respiratory control in rabbit pups exposed to cocaine in utero will provide a useful model for the study of mechanisms operative in SIDS. © 1990.

AB  - The relationships between self‐reported assessments of acute anxiety and several biochemical and physiological indicators of stress reaction were investigated in pregnant women at term in connection with spinal analgesia for caesarean section. Fear and apprehension were statistically significantly associated only with blood pressure and with an increase in heart rate from the previous daty. The subjective estimate of the quality of the preoperative night's sleep was negatively associated with biochemical plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of sympatho‐adrenal activity. The previously reported negative correlation between body height and 5‐hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5‐HIAA, an indicator of serotonin metabolism) in lumbar CSF was confirmed. The concentration of 5‐HIAA in CSF was positively correlated with the levels of other acidic monoamine metabolites and cortisol in CSF. It is concluded that hormone and monoamine metabolite measurements in CSF and plasma have only limited usefulness as quantitative indicators of the intensity of preoperative fear and anxiety. © 1990 Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Fonden

AB  - Clomethiazol (Distraneurin) has decisively improved our therapeutic possibilities in delirium tremens. Furthermore, it has acquired a certain degree of importance in the treatment of agitation and sleep disorders in geronto-psychiatric patients. In the meantime, owing to the fact that doctors have been too ready to prescribe it for indications other than those mentioned above, a level of abuse of this substance--which has the potential for both psychological and physical dependence--has reached a point at which its usefulness threatens to become eclipsed.

AB  - The distribution of symptoms, physiologic responses, and upper airway structure in members of one family with three generations of subjects with sleep apnea (SA) is reported. Questionnaire data were obtained from ten family members (ages 7 to 66 years), overnight sleep studies were performed in nine subjects, and ventilatory responses to hyperoxic hypercapnia and to eucapnic hypoxia and cephalometry were obtained in five subjects. All ten family members reported habitual snoring or nighttime snorting/gasping; five of ten family members also reported excessive daytime sleepiness. All studied subjects except for a pregnant woman had greater than ten apneas/hypopneas per hour. Ventilatory responses to hypoxia were markedly reduced in all five subjects studied (≤0.51 L/min/SaO2); hypercapnic responses were reduced in three morbidly obese (body mass index &lt;29 kg/m2) or demonstrated retrognathia. The posterior airway space was reduced in three subjects, and the mandibular to hyoid distance was increased in four subjects. The two subjects with the longest soft palates and the most inferiorly displaced hyoids had the most severe sleep disorder. Sleep apnea was present, albeit less profound, in the one subject with normal anatomy who had an abnormal hypoxic ventilatory response. The distribution of these physiologic and anatomic measurements in this family provides further support for a genetic basis for SA, and suggests that the disorder may occur as a result of interactions between ventilatory control abnormalities and anatomic risk factors.

AB  - To determine the association between maternal activity and pregnancy outcome, the authors investigated the separate influences of time, physical effort, and posture at work, both at a job and in the home, on birth weight Study subjects were 1,507 of 1,889 women appearing consecutively for antenatal care at a district general hospital in inner London, England, in 1982-1984. Data were collected prospectively by interview and examination at several stages of pregnancy. Multivariable linear regression was used to distinguish associations with physical activity from confounding by other factors. The mean birth weight of infants born to women in full-time employment was 49 g less than that for births to women not in paid work (95 percent confidence interval (Cl) 1-97 g). However, the difference was due to confounding, and after adjustment, full-time employment was associated with a 12-g increase in birth weight (95 percent Cl -39 to 63 g). There was little difference in birth weight related to gestational stage at leaving work. Duration, physical effort required, and energy expenditure in paid work and in work at home had no discernible association with birth weight A small increase in birth weight was associated with increased hours of sleep. These data allow estimates of associations with birth weight as precise as 80 g. Within the range of activities performed by pregnant women in the population studied, birth weight is unlikely to be associated with maternal physical activity. © 1990 by The Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health.

AB  - Maternal genetic factors and/or fetal genetic factors contribute to variations in response to prenatal alcohol exposure. To assess the contribution of maternal genotype to ethanol teratogenesis, a reciprocal cross study was conducted in an animal model using C57BL/6J (B6) and long‐sleep (LS) mice. B6 mice are more susceptible than LS mice to prenatal ethanol‐induced malformations but both mouse stocks are susceptible to fetal weight deficits following in utero alcohol exposure. B6 and LS dams were reciprocally mated to B6 or LS males producing four embryonic genotype groups: the true‐bred B6B6 and LSLS genotypes, and the genetically similar B6LS and LSB6 genotypes (the F1 genotype). Dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of sucrose (S) on day 9 of pregnancy. Fetuses were removed on gestation day 18, weighed, and assessed for soft tissue or skeletal malformations. Results showed a greater litter weight deficit and increased total malformation rate in ethanol‐exposed F1 litters carried by B6 mothers compared to ethanol‐exposed F1 litters carried by LS mothers. This result would be expected only if maternal genetic factors contribute significantly towards susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis. The influence of the LS mother was to decrease susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis compared to the B6 mother while the influence of the B6 mother was to increase susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis compared to the LS mother. The average malformation rate for F1 litters was significantly less than the predicted midparental value. This shows that the F1 genotype exhibited dominance towards resistance to prenatal alcohol effects. There was no differential effect of prenatal treatment on male and female fetuses for any embryonic genotype, indicating that the differential teratogenic response between F1 litters was not due to sex‐linked traits. Likewise, weight gain due to pregnancy and maternal blood ethanol levels did not differ among genotypes. It was concluded that genetic factors differentially influence maternal physiological response to ethanol, which in turn affects teratogenic responses in F1 litters. Separation of maternal physiological mechanisms from fetal mechanisms responsible for ethanol teratogenic susceptibility is needed for targeting women and infants at risk. Such knowledge will help in formulating effective therapeutic intervention strategies. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Abnormalities of respiratory regulation, such as apnea and abnormal hypoxic arousal during sleep, are mechanistic in the pathophysiology of SIDS. In utero cocaine exposure is associated with poor head growth, abnormal neurodevelopment, and an increased incidence of sudden, unexplained death, suggesting that in utero cocaine exposure disrupts the central regulation of breathing. It is likely that this disruption is due to altered CNS maturation. Indeed, cocaine alters norepinephrine metabolism within the locus coeruleus, important in arousal from sleep, suggesting that the increased incidence of SIDS in cocaine exposed infants may be secondary to sleep-related deficits in arousal. Since components of fetal behavioural state organization reflect the successful integration of the Central Nervous System, have a specific developmental timetable, and can be studied by fetal ultrasound techniques, we developed a strategy for assessing the state organization of the fetus by ultrasound techniques. We hypothesize that fetal evaluation of state will be a marker of abnormal CNS maturation and a predictor of risk, i.e. abnormal neurodevelopent and/or state related arousal deficits predisposing the cocaine exposed neonate to SIDS. We propose that the study of in utero cocaine exposed fetuses will provide a human model for examining the pathophysiology of SIDS. © 1990.

AB  - The possibility that adenosine mediates hypoxic inhibition of fetal breathing and eye movements was tested in nine chronically catheterized fetal sheep (0.8 term). Intracarotid infusion of adenosine (0.25 ± 0.03 mg · min-1 · kg-1) for 1 h to the fetus increased heart rate and hemoglobin concentration but did not significantly affect mean arterial pressure or blood gases. As with hypoxia, adenosine decreased the incidence of rapid eye movements by 55% and the incidence of breathing by 77% without significantly affecting the incidence of low-voltage electrocortical activity. However, with longer (9 h) administration, the incidence of breathing and eye movements returned to normal during the adenosine infusion. Intravenous infusion of theophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist, prevented most of the reduction in the incidence of breathing and eye movements normally seen during severe hypoxia (Δ arterial PO2 = -10 Torr). It is concluded that 1) adenosine likely depresses fetal breathing and eye movements during hypoxia and 2) downregulation of adenosine receptors may contribute to the adaptation of breathing and eye movements during prolonged hypoxia.

AB  - To investigate changes of intracerebral blood flow velocity correlated to different behavioural states, pulsed Doppler measurements were performed on anterior cerebral artery in 12 preterm and term neonates under polygraphic recordings and in view of the infants' behavioural state. Under very strict definition of the behavioural states there were significant differences in the parameters V<inf>m</inf> (+25%), V<inf>d</inf> (+75%), and V<inf>s</inf> (+11%) in active compared to quiet sleep state. MABP was not significantly different in all examined behavioural states. From our results we conclude that in further Doppler studies the infants' behavioural state at the time of measurement should be assessed carefully. © 1990 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Moderate sodium restriction (70 to 100 mEq/day) leads to a fall in blood pressure for only a minority (§25%) of patients with mild hypertension. At the same time, it may also be hazardous by 1) increasing blood pressure in some patients (perhaps 15%); 2) disturbing sleep; 3) reducing intake of other valuable nutrients; and 4) decreasing host resistance to such stressful events as diarrhea, hyperthermia, and bleeding. In view of the limited positive effect demonstrated in short term studies, the absence of proven reduction in cardiovascular disease occurrence, as well as both documented and theoretical hazards, a blanket recommendation that all hypertensives restrict sodium intake is unwarranted. Moderate sodium restriction is, like other strategies, one therapeutic modality that may be applied, with caution, in individual cases. © 1990 by the American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

AB  - The association between respiratory complications of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and prematurity in infants has not been described completely. We studied 82 consective infants less than 6 months of age with major respiratory symptoms suspected to be caused by GER. Twenty-eight patients had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Extended (18 to 24 hours) esophageal pH monitoring was used to document GER with a pH score. Respiratory complications were considered to be caused by GER if a prolonged mean duration of sleep reflux (ZMD) was found. Seventy-five of the 82 (91%) infants had documented GER, but only 45 (55%) had a prolonged ZMD. The incidence of GER was high regardless of the gestational age at birth, postconceptual age at time of study, and the presence of BPD. The incidence of a prolonged ZMD was higher in infants who were 34 to 39 weeks' gestation (10/12, 83%) than in infants who were less than 34 weeks' gestation at birth (15/37, 41%; P=.01). The incidence of a prolonged ZMD was lowest in infants 39 weeks or less postconceptual age at the time of study (4/14, 29%; P=.017). Most infants with BPD did not have a prolonged ZMD (12/28, 43%). However, 11 of the 12 (92%) infants with BPD and a prolonged ZMD showed dramatic improvement after effective antireflux therapy compared with 0 of 16 infants with BPD and normal ZMD (P<.001). In conclusion, the incidence of reflux-induced respiratory complications as determined by a prolonged ZMD appears to be low in infants before 39 weeks postconceptual age, even though the incidence of GER is high. This observation suggests that the development of a prolonged ZMD may involve factors other than GER that occur near term. The presence of a prolonged ZMD is probably not a major factor in the development of BPD, but it may delay recovery from BPD. © 1990 W.B. Saunders Company.

AB  - Human fetal breathing movements (FBM) differ from neonatal breathing in that they are predominantly paradoxical and are not present all the time. Respiratory pauses are common in the fetus while prolonged apneas are life-threatening in the neonate. In the latter they occur during state 2 (active sleep) when paradoxical breathing is more frequent. Then the inward movement of the thoracic wall causes spreading of the caudal ribs which may elicit an intercostal-to-phrenic inhibitory reflex (IPIR) leading to apnea. This is not the case in state 1 (quiet sleep). In the fetus similar sleep states, state 2F and 1F respectively, have been identified and we investigated if the IPIR is already present before birth and if so, if the response is different between 1F and 2F. In 21 healthy fetuses between 37 and 40 weeks, two real time scanners and a cardiotocograph were used to asses the fetal behavioural state, If FBM were present, the caudo-lateral part of the fetal thoracic wall was shortly compressed manually and the period that FBM ceased measured. During the same epoch moments of shamstimulation, i.e. control periods without actual compression were also carried out. In 15 out of 16 fetuses with FBM in 1F, and in 19 out of 19 fetuses in 217, compressions were immediately followed by an apnea. In contrast, moments of shamstimulation never induced apnea, indicating that the IPIR is indeed present in both behavioural states. The mean apnea duration in 1F (29 compressions) was 13.9 ±9.1 s (range 4-37 s), in 2F (31 compressions) 18.3 ±12.7 s (range 4-48 s). These results were not significantly different. We conclude that the IPIR is already present in utero and can be induced by manual compression of the thoracic wall. Furthermore, although breathing is less frequent and much more regular during IF, the effect of the IPIR seems to be similar in 1F and 2F in the healthy near term fetus. © 1990.

AB  - The prevalence and correlates of jitteriness were evaluated in a sample of 936 healthy full-term infants. Jitteriness was seen in 44% of this sample: 23% were classified as mildly jittery, 8% as moderately jittery, and 13% as extremely jittery. Jitteriness was seen most commonly in infants who were sleepy or active and least commonly in infants who were quietly wakeful during the neonatal examination. Jittery infants were more likely to be difficult to console when crying (P < .01) and less visually alert (P < .001) than were nonjittery infants. Jitteriness was seen more commonly in slightly smaller (P < .05) and shorter (P < .001) infants, in those more than 12 hours old (P < .01), and in those not exposed to general anesthesia (P < .05). In an expanded sample of 1054 healthy and sick full-term infants, jitteriness was observed more commonly in neonates who had been exposed prenatally to maternal marijuana use (P < .01), but not to cocaine use (P = .1), and whose mothers had a positive postpartum urine assay for marijuana (P < .05) or cocaine (P = .06). The magnitude of these drug effects, however, was small. These findings have important implications for the early parent-infant relationship, pediatric practice, and future research.

AB  - A prospective comparative study was carried out on the development of 40 infants born by in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and of their relationships with their mothers. This group was compared with two control groups: children born to infertile women after ovulation has been induced but where assisted reporduction was not used; a group of infants born after normal conception without medical intervention at all. The results at 9 months showed that there were no major developmental problems in IVF infants as compared with the controls. All the same, there are more troubles as far as sleep is concerned with IVG children and with the group of infertile mothers and these symptoms seem to be linked to difficulty in the mother-infant relationship. These troubles are minor ones and appear to be only temporary.

AB  - Most previous efforts to characterize elec-trocortical states in the unanesthetized fetal lamb have relied on descriptive measures of amplitude and frequency; those that used quantitative parameters did not draw upon data from a cohort of subjects for contiguous time segments. We have used Fourier analysis to quantitate amplitude and frequency characteristics of records of 2-3 h for a group of fetuses. Four electrocortical states, including two types of transitional activity, have been identified and quantitated. Additionally, we have developed a method that automates the assignment of data to these four electro-cortical states. This has enabled us to monitor transitions among states and indicates that epochs that appear homogeneous by descriptive measures may actually encompass several patterns of electrocortical activity. © 1990 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Graded methemoglobinemia (MetHb) was produced in unanesthetized fetal sheep to determine the effects on brain oxygenation. MetHb was induced by infusing methemoglobin-containing erythrocytes in exchange for fetal blood. During the hour after MetHb was established, fetal methemoglobin concentrations averaged 1.23 ± 0.12 (mild MetHb), 1.71 ± 0.13 (moderate MetHb), and 2.27 ± 0.17 g/dl (severe MetHb). MetHb reduced mean arterial O2 content by ~19 (mild MetHb), 29 (moderate MetHb), and 39% (severe MetHb). The average preductal arterial PO2 fell by 1.6 (-7%), 2.8 (-11%), and 4.0 Torr (-16%) for mild, moderate, and severe MetHb, respectively. Fetal heart rate increased significantly during mild and moderate MetHb, and mean arterial pressure fell slightly during moderate and severe MetHb. The incidence of fetal breathing and eye movements were reduced in a dose-dependent manner when the calculated brain end-capillary PO2 was &lt;14 Torr. We conclude that: 1) the effective capillary PO2 in the fetal brain can be significantly reduced by increasing the distance between non-methemoglobin-laden erythrocytes in capillaries and 2) hypoxic inhibition of fetal breathing probably arises from discrete areas of the brain having a PO2 &lt;3 Torr.

AB  - For 2 years, from January 1985 to December 1986, we carried out a thorough investigation of sudden death or apparent sudden death in a population between 5 and 19 years of age in Osaka Prefecture. Sudden death (unexpected death caused by intrinsic factors within 24h after the onset of symptoms) occurred in 62 boys and 30 girls, with an annual sudden death rate of 3.0 per 100,000 for boys and 1.5 per 100,000 for girls. Of these 92 deaths, 64 occurred among school children (elementary or high school students), and it was these that were subjected to further analyses. Of the school children deaths, 29.7% seemed to be apparent sudden cardiac death (based on circumstances immediately before death, although these was no definite evidence for sudden cardiac death), and 29.7% were sudden death clearly attributable to underlying heart diseases (hence, sudden cardiac death in the usual meaning of this term accounted for about 60% of the 64 sudden deaths). In addition, 17.2% of the 64 cases were sudden death from bronchial asthma. Analysis of seasonal variation in the incidence of sudden death showed that apparent sudden cardiac death frequently occurred in summer, while sudden death clearly attributable to underlying cardiac diseases often took place in winter, sudden death from bronchial asthma occurred chiefly in summer and fall. Of the total number of sudden deaths, death occurred during exercise in 29.7%, and during sleep in 18.8% of individuals. The percentage of sudden deaths occuring during school hours was as low as 23.4% (15/64). Analysis of the physical condition of the 64 sudden death cases immediately before death disclosed the presence of respiratory infection in 10.9%, fatigue in 21.9%, lack of sleep in 4.7% and other conditions in 4.7%. Thus, the percentage of sudden deaths which occurred under ordinary physical conditions was 57.8% (37/64), of which 14 deaths (21.9% of the total) were associated with exercise. © 1990, The Japanese Circulation Society.

AB  - The influence of two different doses of oral naltrexone on the adverse effects and the analgesia associated with intrathecal morphine was compared in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Thirty-five patients undergoing cesarean section were provided postoperative analgesia by 0.25 mg intrathecal morphine. Sixty minutes later they were given 6 mg naltrexone, 3 mg naltrexone, or placebo as an oral solution. Pain relief was assessed by the Visual Analog Scale. Requirements for additional analgesics and side effects were recorded. Duration of analgesia was shorter in the 3- and 6-mg naltrexone groups than in the placebo group, 10.0 ± 2.6, 12.4 ± 2.6, and 19.2 ± 4.5 h (mean ± SEM), respectively, but values did not reach statistical significance. The incidence of pruritus and vomiting was significantly less in the 6-mg naltrexone group than in the other two groups (P < 0.05). Somnolence was significantly less in the 3- and 6-mg naltrexone groups than in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Naltrexone (6 mg) is an effective oral prophylactic against the pruritus and vomiting associated with intrathecal morphine for analgesia after cesarean section, but it is associated with shorter duration of analgesia.

AB  - Previous observations have demonstrated that under several different circumstances the pregnant rhesus monkey myometrium shows a spontaneous shift in activity from contractures to contractions around the beginning of the hours of darkness. Preliminary studies were conducted to demonstrate that the competitive oxytocin antagonist [1-β-Mpa(β-(CH2)5)1)Me)Tyr2,Orn8] oxytocin was effective in vivo in inhibiting oxytocin induced contraction type myometrial activity in the pregnant rhesus monkey in the last third of gestation. Four pregnant and one fetectomized rhesus monkey (98-141 days gestation) received one intra-arterial dose of oxytocin antagonist to study its ability to inhibit myometrial contractions occurring spontaneously around the onset of prevailing nighttime. In three pregnant monkeys (105-121 days gestation) maternal aterial plasma oxytocin levels were measured at 4-h intervals for a period of 48 h. Maternal plasma oxytocin concentration was maximal during the early hours of darkness and demonstrated a significant 24-h rhythm. From the combined results of both experiments it may be concluded that circulating oxytocin and/or a change in one of the many potential regulatory sites for oxytocin function plays a role in the switch from contractures to contractions that occurs arund the beginning of the hours of darkness.

AB  - A device using four infra-red light photocells per cage which monitor simultaneously the motility of 120 individual rodents, was developed at our institute. The measuring interval can be chosen freely, the starting time may be set freely and the test may last several weeks. The motility of the offspring (day 35-39) of dams exposed to the neuroleptic haloperidol during lactation was investigated, because of the important stage of the brain development in the neonatal age and of the relatively high concentration of haloperidol in the milk. Mice dams were treated sc. with a single dose (1.5 mg/kg) of haloperidol postnatally on day 3 to 6. Compared to the controls the body weight gain of treated (via milk) pups was reduced (controls = 72%, haloperidol = 30%) and the mortality was higher (controls = 10%, haloperidol = 77%) during the treatment period. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the locomotor activity from day 35 to day 39 shows a distinct shift in the kind of motility: the locomotor activity of haloperidol offspring is significantly reduced while the number of activity phases is increased. It appears that there is a persistent alteration in the central nervous system that leads to a higher frequency but a lower efficacy of activity.

AB  - Blood samples were collected every 2 h during a 24 h period from 6 cows of one herd and 10 cows of another herd. In a third herd 9 cows were sampled every 2 h from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. Concentrations of total bile acids, acetoacetate, glucose and free fatty acids were determined in blood plasma. A marked difference in individual bile acid concentrations and patterns of diurnal variation was found. For most cows the highest bile acid values were observed between 2 and 6 a.m. (overall mean (+/- SD) at 6 a.m.: 104 +/- 84 mumol/l, range: 20-307 mumol/l). Fourteen cows with a bile acid value greater than 90 mumol/l at 6 a.m. ("high BA") were characterized as a group by showing a pronounced decrease in the mean bile acid concentration after morning feeding. In the group of 11 cows with a 6 a.m. bile acid value less than 90 mumol/l ("low BA") the time of day did not contribute significantly to the bile acid variation. For the "high BA" group a nearly synchronous variation between the mean values of the 3 feeding dependent parameters (acetoacetate, glucose and free fatty acids) and the mean values of bile acids was found. The within animal coefficients of correlation between bile acids and the feeding dependent parameters were significantly higher in the "high BA" group than in the "low BA" group. No direct connection was found between bile acid levels and the quantity of concentrates fed or the individual milk yield.

AB  - Genetic factors have been implicated as contributing to the considerable variation in the severity of alcohol-related birth defects in offspring of women who drink heavily during pregnancy. Two animal models of alcohol-related developmental effects incorporated different behavior genetic approaches to examine genetic influences on brain and body growth following alcohol exposure during development. The first, extensively developed in Sprague-Dawley rats, examined the effects of three doses of alcohol administered to two inbred rat strains (MR and M520) via artificial-rearing procedures during the early postnatal brain growth spurt. In both strains, alcohol produced a dose-dependent restriction of brain weight (but not body weight) on postnatal day 10, compared to artificially reared controls. The MR strain was more susceptible to cerebellar growth restriction than the M520 strain, an effect not attributable to strain differences in blood alcohol concentrations. In the second model, pregnant female Long-sleep and Short-sleep mice, selectively bred for differences in initial sensitivity to the hypnotic effects of acute alcohol administration, were intubated with ethanol from gestational days 7 - 18. Controls included either sucrose or maltose/dextrin intubation controls and non-intubated controls. The LS offspring showed growth deficits and brain weight reductions in adulthood, while the SS offspring were resistant to these detrimental effects of the prenatal alcohol exposure. Thus, differences in either maternal or fetal genotype may contribute to individual differences in the severity of the effects of alcohol exposure during development.

AB  - According to previous observations, the variations in serum alkaline DNase activity (SADA) appeared to be useful in monitoring malignant disease. In this study, SADA was measured in 625 individuals to explore nontumor-related factors which may influence SADA levels. The overall range in SADA was 0.2-82.3 kU/l. Women aged 50-79 years had higher (p< 0.001) levels of SADA than younger females. A similar but less consistent effect of age was noticed in men (0.01 < p < 0.05). Older men had lower (0.01 < p < 0.05) SADA levels than the older women. Old women substituted with estrogens had lower (0.01 < p < 0.05) levels of SADA than those not treated with estrogens. SADA levels in pregnancy as well as postparturition were lower (p < 0.001) than SADA values in nonpregnant females of similar age. In fertile women, no SADA variation was observed during the menstrual cycle and there was no significant effect of contraceptive pills. In males, SADA seemed unrelated to testosterone or cortisol levels but varied during the day. Smoking, alcohol consumption and drug therapy appeared to be without effect on SADA. © 1989.

AB  - Two systems are described for the collection of 24 h urine samples from the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Using 84 adult animals, 1210 24-h samples were collected. Mean urinary excretion was 14.4 7.5 ml/24h (n=1210, mean SD). No differences were observed between sexes (for 52 females, 24 h volume=15.1 8.0 ml; for 32 males, 24 h volume=12.5 6.0 ml). No significant differences were observed between pregnant and non-pregnant females with respect to 24 h urine volume, and bilateral gonadectomy did not influence subsequent urinary excretion in either sex. For 161 pairs of observations, the intake of drinking water (11.7 10.2 ml/24 h) and the volume of urine excreted (12.6 7.1 ml/24 h) showed a positive correlation r=0.406 d.f. 159, P<0.001: y=0.558x+4.247). © 1989, Royal Society of Medicine Press.

AB  - A case of severe obstructive sleep apnea developing during pregnancy is reported. A 27-year-old primigravida was well until the sixth month of pregnancy, when she developed loud snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography was performed at 36 weeks' gestation and revealed severe obstructive sleep apnea. The patient was treated successfully during pregnancy with nasal continuous positive airway pressure, but continued to suffer from moderate obstructive sleep apnea after delivery. This case suggests that sleep apnea may be either precipitated or exacerbated during pregnancy. © 1989.

Examinations were carried out in 143 pregnant women. In 33 of them the following parameters were evaluated with respect to the values of the biophysical profile: placental maturity, urinary estriol, term and mode of termination of pregnancy, body weight, body length, and Apgar score of newborns. The authors recommend to extend this diagnostic method so that in interpreting the results it yields not only the overall clinical state of the pregnant woman should be considered but also biological rhythms of physiologic functions of the fetus as well the administration of drugs to the woman in pregnancy.

AB  - The postabsorptive serum ferritin levels following normal dosages of prenatal multivitamin/multimineral supplements were studied in 17 pregnant teenagers, whose fetuses were between 16 and 20 weeks gestational age. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of a single oral dose of differing prenatal multivitamin/multimineral tablets containing 60 or 65 mg of elemental iron on the postabsorptive serum ferritin levels. Each woman was randomly tested following the ingestion of one of three different tablets, both in a fed and a fasting state. Blood samples were obtained for ferritin measurement immediately prior to ingestion of the prenatal tablet, with or without a standard meal, and at 1, 3, 6, and 8 hours postabsorption. The group mean serum ferritin levels increased dramatically during the fasting state following ingestion of the Stuart Prenatal(®) tablet and decreased when the Stuartnatal(®) 1 + 1 or Materna(®) 1.60 was ingested. The opposite results were observed when the tablets were ingested postprandially. The results of the study indicate that Stuart Prenatal was most suitable for consumption while fasting (ie, at the hour of sleep), and both Stuartnatal 1 + 1 and Materna 1.60 with a meal.

AB  - The primary neural pathway for entrainment of circadian rhythms in rodents is the retinohypothalamic tract, which conveys lighting information from the retina to a biological clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). In a precocious rodent species, the spiny mouse, the retinohypothalamic tract is present and functioning within the SCN on the day of birth, as assessed by HRP histochemistry and 14C-labeled 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography, respectively. Furthermore, direct perception of environmental lighting was observed in fetal spiny mice late in gestation. Direct, retina-mediated fetal light perception appears to be a less potent entraining agent than maternal cues communicating time-of-day information to the fetal spiny mouse. Nevertheless, direct fetal light perception may reinforce maternal entraining signals during the prenatal period and therefore be of physiological significance for entrainment of circadian rhythmicity in the fetus. © 1989.

AB  - Destruction of the maternal suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) early in gestation disrupts maternal communication of time-of-day information to the rat fetus. In the present study, we demonstrated that periodic feeding (food cue) to SCN-lesioned pregnant rats entrains the fetal biological clock. The phase of the drinking behavior rhythm was examined in pups reared in constant darkness, beginning at weaning. In several control (uncued) litters, pup phases at weaning were scattered. In other control litters where within-litter coordination of phase was observed, the average litter phase was unpredictable. In contrast, drinking rhythms of pups whose dams had received food cue during gestation were synchronized within- and between-litters, suggesting that prenatal food cue entrained the fetuses. The effect of food cue occurs prenatally, as similar results were obtained when offspring of SCN-lesioned, cued dams were fostered to lesioned, uncued dams on the day of birth. The present results, along with data from this and other laboratories, suggest that redundant mechanisms communicate time-of-day information to the fetus. © 1989.

AB  - Diurnal variations in plasma unconjugated estriol and urinary estriol were assessed in 12 pregnant women during the 3rd trimester of uncomplicated pregnancies. Commercially available 125I-labelled radioimmunoassay kits were used. The preliminary data presented here support the hypothesis that there is no circadian rhythm of unconjugated plasma estriol in normal late pregnancy. Total urinary estriol reaches a nadir during the sleep hours (24.00-6.00). A biological carrier 'stick' for estriol measurements might serve as the test of choice in the monitoring of high-risk pregnancy as well as for identifying pregnancies complicated by chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down's syndrome). © 1989 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - The present study was performed to assess the changes of plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COP) in preeclampsia, and to clarify the character of circadian variations of plasma COP in preeclampsia. During the third trimester of a normal pregnancy, plasma COP values were 21.0 ± 0.2 at 28-31 weeks' gestation, 19.3 ± 0.5 at 32-35 weeks' gestation and 20.4 ± 0.5 mmHg at 36 weeks or more of gestation. These values were significantly lower than those in normal non-pregnant subjects (23.5 ± 0.6). In preeclampsia, plasma COP values (14.7 ± 0.4) were significantly lower than those in normal pregnancy. A circadian variation of plasma COP confirmed a clear circadian rhythm with the acrophase at afternoon in all subjects, and there were no differences among normal non-pregnant, pregnant and severe preeclamptic women. These results indicate that circadian variations of plasma COP are not influenced by either pregnancy or preeclampsia, though plasma COP in preeclampsia significantly decreases. © 1989 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - We have measured the concentrations of vasopressin in sequential samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from fetal lambs between 108 and 130 days gestation. There was a clear and significant (F = 4.46; P < 0.005) rhythm in vasopressin concentrations in the CSF of nine fetuses, characterized by a mean trough value of 19.4 ± 6.4 pg/ml (mean ± SD) at 0200 h and a peak value of 41.1 ± 28.0 pg/ml at 1400 h. The mean cycle length was 23.2 ± 1.7 h, with the majority (≫80%) of peak concentrations found during daylight hours. There were no concurrent fluctuations in concentrations of vasopressin in plasma or Na, K, Cl, or osmolality in CSF. To examine the relationship between environmental cycles of light and darkness and rhythm of vasopressin concentrations in CSF, pregnant animals were maintained in a constant light environment. In the five fetuses of ewes maintained under these conditions, the rhythm of vasopressin in CSF was markedly damped or not apparent (F = 1.50; P ≫ 0.15). These results demonstrate that prominent circadian rhythm of vasopressin in the CSF of the fetus in utero. Despite the fact that the fetus is sequestered from direct influences of the environment, exposure of the pregnant ewe to constant light disrupts the fetal pacemaker that generates the circadian rhythm of vasopressin in CSF. Studies of this rhythm in the fetal lamb, therefore, provide a means to examine the mechanisms of entrainment and assess prenatal influences on circadian organization of the fetus. © 1989 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - To assess the effect of endogenous human atrial natriuretic peptide on the vascular system in preeclampsia, the circadian variations of plasma human atrial natriuretic peptide, cyclic guanosine 3′5′-monophosphate, cyclic adenosine 3′5′-monophosphate, and blood pressure were measured. In severe preeclamptic women, the mean 24-hour values of human atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclic guanosine 3′5′-monophosphate rose significantly compared with those in normal nonpregnant and pregnant women. Also, in severe preeclamptic women, circadian variations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, cyclic guanosine 3′5′-monophosphate, and blood pressure confirmed the same circadian rhythm with acrophase during the middle of the night. Plasma cyclic adenosine 3′5′-monophosphate values did not differ significantly among the three groups and did not confirm a circadian rhythm. These results suggest that plasma human atrial natriuretic peptide may not strongly influence blood pressure, although it may induce the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles via the cyclic guanosine 3′5′-monophosphate system in preeclampsia. © 1989.

AB  - Summary. Circadian variations in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide were studied, to clarify the characteristic pathophysiology of pregnancy‐induced hypertension (PIH). The mean 24‐h values (range) of atrial natriuretic peptide in mild and severe PIH, pregnancy‐aggravated hypertension, chronic hypertension and normal pregnancy were 130·1 (97·3−207·0), 225·4 (202·8−281·8), 213·1 (183·2−249·5), 81·3 (61·8−116·1) and 77·1 (56·0−123·5) pg/ml, respectively. The values in PIH and pregnancy‐aggravated hypertension were significantly higher, although those in chronic hypertension were no different from normal pregnancy. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide showed a clear circadian rhythm with acrophase in the middle of the night, in mild and severe PIH. In the other hypertensive disorders, a circadian rhythm could not be confirmed. The results indicate that the elevated values of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide in hypertensive disorders during pregnancy relate to generalized vasoconstriction, and that the diurnal rhythm is a specific characteristic of PIH.

AB  - Behavioral state distribution in 19 preterm infants at term with good developmental prognosis was studied by 24-h video recordings. The preterm infants of shortest gestation had longer time awake and this was concentrated in the daytime. On classifying behavioral states by Prechtl's criteria, the preterm infants had a smaller amount of state 1 than healthy term infants; but a similar amount of state 5 in awake time. Preterm infants were thought to have accelerated development in terms of diurnal sleep-awake rhythm, and decelerated development in terms of the content of sleep manifested by the amount of state 1. © 1989.

AB  - ICR female mice were exposed to either 22 (L11, D11) or 26 hour day (L13, D13) light/dark cycles for at least 2 weeks before mating and/or during pregnancy. The mating rates of these animals decreased considerably. When pregnant females were examined at gestation days 12.0 or 17.5, resorption rates were increased, the embryos weighed less, and development was retarded in the experimental groups with preconceptional exposure to non‐24‐hour days. We speculate that in mice maternal and paternal pre‐ and periconceptional environment of daily light/dark cycles is important for normal reproductive efficacy and normal embryonic development during pregnancy.

AB  - In women having spontaneous labour or premature rupture of the membranes there is a marked diurnal variation in times of admissions to hospital. Analysis of 4755 nulliparous women with single pregnancies in cephalic presentation at term, indicated that they presented in labour or with premature rupture of the membranes nearly twice as frequently during the night as during the evening. The peak hours for delivery were late morning and afternoon. The authors discuss previously published reports of similar findings and of a diurnal variation in maternal hormone levels in humans and experimental animals. The potential clinical importance of this phenomenon is considered.

AB  - After a 2-month evaluation period, eight women with moderate to severe premenstrual depression and eight age- and sex-matched controls underwent sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) and temperature recordings 2 nights a week over the course of one menstrual cycle. Overall, patients had more Stage 2 (%) sleep and less rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (% and minutes) than normal controls. Stage 3 sleep and number of intermittent awakenings varied with phases of the menstrual cycle. Temperature minima were earlier in patients compared with controls, but this difference was not statistically significant, and there was no significant effect of menstrual cycle phase on the timing of temperature minima. Wrist motor activity did not change during the menstrual cycle in patients or controls. Thus, in this sample of women with premenstrual depression, we did not find sleep EEG alterations similar to those reported in some patients with major depressive disorder. In light of the small number of subjects and the large individual variability, the absence of marked changes with the menstrual cycle may be a function of a Type II error. © 1989.

AB  - During winter (December to March), when late-pregnant ewes were maintained under an artificial long-day photoperiod (16 h light) for 3 weeks or more before insertion of fetal vascular cannulae between 118 and 120 days of gestation (full term, 147 days), plasma prolactin concentrations in their fetal lambs were significantly increased throughout the last 3 weeks of gestation in comparison with values in similar aged fetuses from ewes experiencing only the natural short-day (<9 h light) winter photoperiod. When additional lighting was given only after vascular cannulation, fetal plasma prolactin increased steadily from low values, characteristic of winter pregnancies, to high values, characteristic of long-day (16 h light:8 h darkness) pregnancies. Maternal plasma prolactin concentrations changed in a similar way. During summer pregnancies (>16 h light), plasma prolactin in fetal lambs was significantly reduced within 48 h when ewes were given melatonin by i.v. infusion for 14 h each night to simulate the winter duration of the nocturnal increase in plasma melatonin. Maternal plasma prolactin concentrations also decreased significantly when melatonin was given for 3 weeks, but not in a shorter experiment. Increases in fetal plasma prolactin were proportional to the basal prolactin concentration in fetuses injected i.v. with TRH or a dopaminergic antagonist, metoclopramide, to assess how photoperiod influenced the responsiveness of prolactin secretion to acute stimulation. The results confirm that photoperiod, rather than developmental maturity, is the principal determinant of plasma prolactin in the fetal lamb during the last third of gestation, and provide evidence that photoperiodic information is transmitted to the fetus through the diurnal rhythm of melatonin in the ewe.

AB  - Twenty-four hour noninvasive, automatic and ambulatory control of blood pressure (BP) was carried out on 11 normotensive pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy with a Del Mar Avionics Model 1978 Pressurometer III System at 7.5 min intervals during 24 h. T h e patients kept a detailed record of their activities during those 24 h. BP increased from 9 AM to a peak between 7 and 10 PM. Mean (± S D) waking and sleeping values were 110.56 ± 6.68 mm Hg and 96.5 ± 10.01 mm Hg, respectively, for systolic BP, and 71.41 ± 5.35 mm Hg and 62.82 ± 5.47 mm Hg, respectively, for diastolic BP. There was a significant difference in systolic and diastolic BP between sleeping hours and waking hours. We believe that 24-h control of BP behavior in normotensive pregnant women allows us to adequately diagnose hypertensive disease in pregnancy.

AB  - Summary. Saliva aldosterone concentration was measured in samples collected at hourly intervals from healthy pregnant women (approximately 26 and 36 weeks gestation) who were going about their normal daily activities, and from some women hospitalized for disorders of pregnancy. In the healthy women diurnal saliva aldosterone fluctuated considerably, the highest values being 2–22 times the lowest on a given day. Because of the known correlation between saliva and plasma aldosterone concentrations we believe that the fluctuating salivary level is indicative of fluctuating plasma levels and that this is due to the intermittent secretion of aldosterone. The rate of decline of saliva aldosterone from peak levels indicated a half life (t½) of 72 (SD 31) min which was not significantly different from that in non‐pregnant subjects. The temporal pattern of saliva aldosterone suggests an enhanced response of the zona glomerulosa to the factors that cause aldosterone secretion to fluctuate in non‐pregnant subjects, rather than the development of a more potent stimulus to the zona glomerulosa during pregnancy. In addition to hour‐to‐hour variation there is also substantial day‐to‐day variation, so that estimation of aldosterone in a single sample of saliva or plasma is of little value during pregnancy. The mean diurnal aldosterone concentration can be estimated from five saliva samples so this measurement presents a convenient technique for the assessment of aldosterone status in pregnancy. In contrast to healthy pregnancy, a patient with pre‐eclampsia at 39 weeks gestation showed no elevation of saliva aldosterone above non‐pregnant levels at any time during the day.

AB  - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations during human pregnancy have been investigated by many authors, although the different results obtained, principally in relation to T cells, are very discrepant. In this study we aimed to exclude all the possible causes of these discrepancies: small sample size; diurnal rhythm of CD4+ T cells; smoking habits; haemodilution which occurs during pregnancy and inappropriate statistical analysis; in order to determine whether gestation has a definite effect on PBMC populations. We found that the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes decreases in the first and second trimesters, returns to the non-pregnant level in the third trimester and remains there in the post-partum period. The percentages of CD3+ T lymphocytes run parallel to those of CD4+ while CD8+ T lymphocytes do not vary. The proportion of CD16+ cells, which include mature NK cells, diminishes in the second trimester and this reduction is maintained in the third trimester and the puerperium. No variation was found in the other PBMC studied (CD20+ lymphocytes, CD14+ monocytes and D/DR+ cells). When parity was considered no difference was seen between primiparous and multiparous women in any of the cell populations tested. © 1989.

AB  - We have investigated the effect of pinealectomy of ewes in pregnancy on the presence of the diurnal rhythm in fetal and maternal plasma concentrations of melatonin. Six ewes were pinealectomized between 104 and 118 days of gestation. Fetal and maternal blood samples were collected during 24-h periods between 125 and 140 days of gestation in the pinealectomized ewes and in an intact control (n = 4). There was a significant diurnal rhythm in both fetal and maternal plasma concentrations of melatonin in the control group. In this group, the fetal and maternal plasma melatonin concentrations were significantly higher in the dark (128.4 ± 6.2 and 192.2 ± 10.7 pmol/l respectively) than in the light (46.2 ± 4.2 and 25.8 ±2.1 pmol/l respectively). However there was no diurnal rhythm in either the fetal or maternal plasma melatonin concentrations in the pinealectomized group between 125 and 140 days of gestation. In contrast to the control animals, there was also no light-dark difference in the fetal or maternal plasma melatonin concentrations in four pinealectomized animals sampled frequently in the 3-7 days preceding delivery (mean length of gestation 146.5 days). However, in the pinealectomized sheep there was a gradual increase in the combined light-dark fetal plasma melatonin concentrations during late gestation from 27.9 ± 2.8 pmol/l (at 15-20 days before delivery) to 95.2 ± 14.1 pmol/l on the day of delivery. We have therefore demonstrated that the maternal pineal is the major source of the diurnal rhythm in maternal and fetal plasma melatonin concentrations. However maternal pinealectomy does not appear to remove all the melatonin immunoreactivity from the maternal and fetal plasma in late gestation.

AB  - The ontogency of circadian rhythms is unknown. The newborn sheep has a circadian rhythm of temperature; to study the ontogeny of other rhythms, we examined the 24-h variation of plasma prolactin concentration in fetal and newborn sheep. To this effect, we measured plasma prolactin concentration in chronically catheterized fetuses (n = 7) and in newborn lambs raised under short day nycthemeral (12 light:12 dark, n = 13) or constant light conditions (n = 5). Indwelling catheters were implanted into the jugular vein and carotid artery of late gestation fetuses (0.9 gestation) and newborns (5-29 days old). Experiments were performed 4 or more days after surgery. Lambs were kept in a canvas sling were fed cow's milk either by mouth or through a nasogastric catheter at established time intervals. Haematocrit, pH, and blood gases were measured before and after the experiments in all cases and remained within normal values. Lights were on and room temperature was maintained constant during the whole experiment. Samples were obtained every 1-2 h for 24 h in fetuses and newborn lambs under nycthemeral conditions and every hour for 48 h in newborn lambs kept under constant light. Plasma prolactin was measured by radioimmunoassay. The presence of a 24 h rhythm was determined by Cosinor analysis. Fetuses, aged 129 ± 6 days (SD) n = 7, showed a variation in plasma prolactin concentration with a period of 24 h that fits the equation: plasma prolactin (ng ml-1) = 0.97 + 15.4 cos 15 (t-23.0), P = 0.035. Newborn lambs, aged 7.9 ± 2.3 days old (n = 11), kept under nycthemeral conditions showed a variation of plasma prolactin with a period of 24 h that fits the equation: plasma prolactin (ng ml-1) = 75.3 + 12.9 cos 15 (t-12.0), P = 0.036. This rhythm disappeared in newborns of 23.4 ± 3.8 days of age (n = 7). Newborn lambs, aged 22.0 ± 2.7 days (n = 5), raised under constant light, showed a 24 h variation of plasma prolactin in the individual data. These newborns showed a tendency to higher prolactin values and a wider dispersion of plasma prolactin concentration than the two other groups. To normalize the variance the group mean was calculated after log transformation. When log values were synchroniced considering the acrophase of the theoretical function as 24 h a rhythm that fits the equation: log plasma prolactin (ng ml-1) = 1.8 + 0.29 cos 15 (t-0.5), P = 0.031, was observed. This indicates that the rhythm of prolactin in the newborn sheep free-runs under constant light. The presence of a rhythm in plasma prolactin with a period of 24 h in fetuses and in the newborn, and the existence of this free running rhythm in newborns kept under constant light, suggest that the prolactin rhythm observed is a circadian rhythm endogenously generated. In addition, the disappearance of the rhythm in older newborns raised under short nycthemeral conditions, and its maintenance in newborns of similar age kept under constant light, suggests that the newborn sheep is sensitive to photoperiod.

AB  - ABSTRACT. The effect of odour attractants on the composition of samples of Glossina pallidipes Austen was investigated by comparing the age and nutritional status of flies caught in unbaited biconical traps with those caught in traps baited with cow urine and acetone. For both male and female flies, baited traps caught more flies with significantly higher fat content than did unbaited traps. Thus the samples from baited traps were more representative of the population as a whole: males showed a fuller range of the fat/haematin conditions known to occur in the field and proportionately more females were in later stages of the pregnancy cycle, than from unbaited traps.

AB  - Unexplained high serum corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) concentrations [mean values, 78.8 and 55.7 mg/L; normal women, 38.8 ± 3.8 (±sd) mg/L] were found repeatedly in two apparently healthy sisters who were not pregnant or taking exogenous estrogens. One had substantial variations in serum CBG and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations during the menstrual cycle, which paralleled the normal cyclic changes in serum estradiol. The other woman was postmenopausal and had a high serum CBG concentration despite of low serum estradiol levels. We conclude those women have an inherited abnormality in CBG production. © 1989 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - To assess the pathophysiology of nocturnal hypertension in preeclamptics, diurnal changes in thermal conductivity of the skin, and blood pressure were studied in normal pregnant and preeclamptic subjects from 28 weeks of gestation onward. Changes of thermal conductivity of the skin were measured using the zero-heat flow method. In all preeclamptics with nocturnal hypertension, thermal conductivity of the skin in the night-time increased significantly compared to that during the day, though there was no change between the night- and day-time in the normal pregnant subjects. Heart rate did not change in any subject with preeclampsia. Evidence that the increase in thermal conductivity in the skin and the elevation of blood pressure occurred simulta- neously during the night suggested that nocturnal hypertension in preeclamptics may relate to increases in circulating plasma volume. © 1989 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - Chondrocytes of the cartilaginous growth plate are found in a spatial gradient of cellular differentiation beginning with cellular proliferation and ending with cellular hypertrophy. Although it is recognized that both proliferation and hypertrophy contribute significantly to overall bone growth, mechanisms acting on the chondrocyte to control the timing, the rate, and the extent of hypertrophy are poorly understood. Similarly, mechanisms acting on the terminal chondrocyte to cause its death at the chondro‐osseous junction have not been investigated. In this study we examine the condensation of terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes in proximal and distal radial growth plates of Yucatan swine at 4 weeks of age. The animals were raised in a controlled environment where activity and feeding patterns were synchronized to a given time in the light/dark cycle. We analyzed cellular condensation both as a function of circadian rhythms in a 24‐hr time period, and as a function of overall rate of growth. The data suggest that the magnitude of circadian influences on long bone growth is significantly damped at the level of the hypertrophic chondrocyte compared to that seen by previous investigators studying circadian influences on chondrocytic proliferation. Secondly, the condensation of hypertrophic chondrocytes at the chodro‐osseous junction varies inversely with rate of growth in length of the bone. At any time period, a higher percentage of terminal chondrocytes in the condensed form was found in the slower‐growing of the two growth plates. We relate these findings to current hypotheses concerning controls of chondrocytic hypertrophy and possible controls over the timing of hypertrophic cell death. Copyright © 1989 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

AB  - Diurnal variations in serum concentrations of thyrotropin (TSH), prolactin (PRL) and cortisol were measured in 4 women during late stages of pregnancy (gestational weeks 34–38), in 2 women at an early stage of pregnancy (gestational weeks 11 and 17) and in 2 nonpregnant women. Blood samples were obtained through a nonthrombogenic catheter using continuous withdrawal of blood by means of a portable pump changing the recipient tube at 30-min intervals. Serum TSH concentrations showed a diurnal variation in both pregnant and nonpregnant women with maximal values around midnight. Serum PRL concentrations were elevated in pregnant women but the concentrations showed marked variations indicating episodic secretion of the hormone. Serum cortisol concentrations increased in pregnant women, but the typical diurnal pattern persisted with nadir levels around midnight and marked elevations during the early morning hours. The results suggest that also during human pregnancy there is a diurnal variation in TSH and cortisol secretion, as well as an episodic secretion of PRL. © 1989 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - The percentage of breech presentations in the course of the 32nd to 40th week of gestation is 5.1%; vertex presentations were found in 94.9%. In the primiparae we found 6.0% of breech presentations against 4.3% in the multiparae. Sub partu there were breech presentations in 4.5% (in primiparae more often than in multiparae). A spontaneous change from vertex- into breech presentation from the 32nd to 40th week of gestation was evident in 4 cases = 0.41% [in the primiparae (n = 484) in one case = 0.21%; in the multiparae (n = 531) in 3 cases = 0.59%] A change from breech presentation (n = 52) into vertex presentation occurred in the same period in 9 cases = 17.31% [in primiparae (n = 29) in 10.34%, in multiparae (n = 23) in 26.09%; the difference is statistically not significant!] All cases of change from vertex- into breech presentation were seen until the 35th week of pregnancy, not later, whereby the cases of change from breech- into vertex presentation happend until the 36th week of pregnancy (except one 'late' change in the 39th week in a multipara), in the primiparae until the 36th week, in the multiparae until the 35th week of gestation. Thus, apart from rare exceptions, the definite birth-presentation of the fetus has taken place about the 35th/36th week of gestation. Late changes of position of the fetus are not likely. A diagram with the exact percentages and likelihood of changes of the fetus presentation for primi- and multiparae between 32nd and 40th week of gestation is given.

AB  - Rats hysterectomized on Day 7 or 8 of pregnancy continued to have nocturnal prolactin surges 1 day later. Conditioned medium obtained from incubation of Day 11 placentas infused via the jugular vein completely blocked this nocturnal surge, indicating a negative feedback of placental secretions on prolactin. Infusion of an ultrafiltrate of the conditioned medium which only contained molecules with Mr above 10,000 also blocked the prolactin surge. Next, it was determined whether this feedback of placental secretions on prolactin may work by way of hypothalamic dopamine. Levels of dopamine in hypophysial stalk blood from pregnant rats on Day 12, a time when secretion of placental lactogen is high, were not different from those in rats in which placental lactogen was absent. It is concluded that termination of prolactin surges at midpregnancy may be due to feedback of placental secretions, possibly placental lactogen, on the hypothalamus and/or pituitary. However, these experiments do not support the hypothesis that this inhibition is mediated by alteration in hypothalamic dopamine secretion. © 1989, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - The presence of respiratory-like activity or fetal breathing movements (FBM) were thought to be present in the human fetus from as early as 1905, when Ahlfeld made permanent recordings of what was subsequently shown to be FBM using pressure sensors applied to the abdomen of pregnant women. It was not, however, until the development of methods of recording intrathoracic pressure in chronically catheterized pregnant sheep that the existence of FBM in utero in the undisturbed fetus was widely accepted. These early studies in pregnant sheep led investigators to confirm (using A-scan ultrasound techniques) that FBM do indeed exist in healthy human fetuses. This work was then followed by the introduction of real-time B-scan ultrasound with which clinicians and investigators were able for the first time to visualize directly the human fetus in utero, and, in particular, movement of the fetal chest and abdominal walls. FBM occur episodically and are present approximately 30 per cent of the time during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy. Episodes of FBM last approximately 20 to 60 minutes, alternating with periods of apnea, with the longest period of absent FBM seen in healthy human fetuses at 38 weeks studied continuously over 24 hours being 120 minutes.

AB  - Either 15 or 50 mg/kg of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) was administered from Day 2 through Day 22 of gestation. Pair-fed (0 mg/kg) and nontreated groups served as controls and all treated and control litters were fostered at birth to untreated dams. To examine whether delta-9-THC produces effects on the rest-activity cycle of the offspring, groups of 3 littermates from each of the treated and control groups were tested for an 8 hr observation period on electronic activity monitors at 17, 22 and 30 days of age. Whereas all treated and control groups showed age-dependent changes in activity, neither activity level nor the rest-activity pattern were affected by delta-9-THC. These findings are discussed in relation to neurobehavioral studies of activity changes following prenatal exposure to cannabis. © 1989.

AB  - The possible effect of altered maternal nutrition of fetal prolactin (PRL) secretion and the possible presence of a diurnal rhythm in fetal PRL secretion has been investigated in 11 fetuses aged between 132 and 140 days of gestation. Fetal PRL levels in 4 of 5 ewes fed once a day were high (>40 ng/ml) and exhibited a distinct diurnal rhythm in PRL secretion. Fetal PRL levels in those fetuses where ewes fed 4-hourly (n = 6) were all low (< 10 ng/ml) and did not exhibit a diurnal rhythm. This study suggests that frequent maternal feeding results in low fetal PRL concentrations and that maternal undernutrition results in high fetal PRL levels that exhibit a distinct diurnal rhythm.

AB  - Eight rhesus macaques between 127 and 132 days of gestation had catheters implanted into maternal femoral vessels and the amniotic fluid cavity and were placed in a vest-and-tether system for chronic catheter maintenance. Uterine activity was continuously recorded, and paired maternal arterial blood and amniotic fluid samples were collected at 0900 h (AM) and 2100 h (PM) until delivery and analyzed for prostaglandin metabolites (PGFM and PGEM-II). A circadian pattern in uterine contractility was observed, with peak activity occurring between 1900 and 0100 h (p less than 0.001). No significant AM-PM differences were observed in maternal plasma PGFM (240 +/- 24 AM vs. 273 +/- 35 PM) or PGEM-II (537 +/- 41 AM vs. 484 +/- 34 PM) or amniotic fluid PGFM (360 +/- 72 AM vs. 287 +/- 70 PM) or PGEM-II (1626 +/- 383 AM vs. 1771 +/- 431 PM). All values represent mean +/- SEM, pg/ml. Additional samples were collected at 3-h intervals for 24 h at selected times during the study. This more intensive sampling protocol also failed to reveal any significant time trends in maternal plasma or amniotic fluid prostaglandins. Despite the lack of AM-PM differences, amniotic fluid PGFM and PGEM-II increased significantly as delivery approached (p less than 0.01). It appears that circadian uterine activity is not related to changes in maternal plasma or amniotic fluid prostaglandins. Although prostaglandins are responsible for the progression of labor, other factors may be involved in the generation of uterine activity rhythms prior to the initiation of labor.

AB  - Due to their structural similarity to ethanol, a human teratogen, and their widespread use in industry, a series of industrial alcohols are being investigated for developmental toxicity. This paper presents the results of exposures to 7000 ppm l-propanol, which is minimally toxic to maternal animals and produces a low incidence of teratogenicity, and to 3500 ppm l-propanol, which is not toxic to maternal rats and produces no teratogenicity. Propanol vapors or filtered air was administered for 7 hr/day to 15 pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats throughout gestation or to 18 male rats daily for 6 weeks. Tests of offspring were: a) ascent on a wire mesh screen, b) rotorod, c) open field and optically monitored activity, d) running wheel, e) avoidance conditioning, and f) progressive fixed ratio schedule of reinforcement. Brains from 10 rats per group were dissected into cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and midbrain, and were assayed for protein, acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, β-endorphin, Met-enkephalin, and substance P. Overall, the results indicate that exposure to high concentrations of l-propanol can affect fertility in exposed males (only 2 of 17 produced litters), but there were no consistent effects seen in the behavioral or neurochemical tests measured. This lack of effects is surprising based on predictions from the structural similarity of l-propanol to ethanol, and on long-standing observations that toxicity (to adult animals) increases with carbon chain length among the aliphatic alcohols. © 1989.

AB  - The rate of reproductive development in juvenile male Siberian hamstersis strongly influenced by daylength (photoperiod). Recent studies indicate that reception of photoperiodic cues begins during fetal life. The present experiments yielded a further demonstration that developing male Siberian hamsters receive information about the photoperiod to which their mother is exposed during pregnancy. The possibility that photoperiodic information is transmitted from mother to young after birth was investigated by cross‐fostering young gestated on 12L and 16L to mothers from the other photoperiod. Litters were cross‐fostered on the day of birth and then were transferred, along with their foster mothers, to 14L. We found no influence of the mother after birth, indicating that transmission of photoperiodic information from mother to young must occur during gestation. To determine if the pineal gland of the mother is required for this response, adult females were pinealectomized or sham‐operated and paired with intact males in 12L, 14L, or 16L. After parturition parents and offspring were exposed to 14L. The influence of prenatal photoperiod on postnatal testicular development in 14L was blocked by pinealectomy of the mother. Postnatal testicular development was retarded in offspring that experienced a photoperiod transfer from either 15L to 14L or 8L to 12L at birth. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of a transfer from 16L to 14L at birth was abolished when juvenile males were exposed to a single long photoperiod (16.3 h light) at age 17–21 days and then were returned to 14L.

AB  - The circadian pattern of plasma PRL levels and the PRL response to suckling were examined at various times during the first postpartum year and related to the length of lactational amenorrhea. Ten healthy women whose infants were breast-fed exclusively and who were amenorrheic 3 months postpartum were studied 3, 6, and 9–11 months postpartum. The women and their babies were admitted to a metabolic unit for 48 h. On the second day, blood samples were drawn at 2-h intervals for 26 h starting at 0800 h and also 10 and 30 min after the initiation of six of the nursing episodes. During the three postpartum periods, there was a circadian rhythm of basal plasma PRL concentrations; the peak concentrations occurred between 2400–0600 h. Suckling induced a significant rise in plasma PRL levels at all hours except 0800 h. There was a positive correlation between the duration of the nursing episode and the suckling-induced PRL increase at 30 min. Both the basal plasma PRL levels and the PRL responses to suckling diminished with time after delivery. This trend was less evident at 0400 h and was not fully explained by changes in the nursing pattern. The five women in whom menstrual cycles resumed before day 180 postpartum had lower basal and suckling-induced plasma PRL levels than the women who had amenorrhea for a longer period. This difference was present in the third month, when all women were amenorrheic and fully nursing and when the frequency and duration of nursing episodes and infant growth rates were similar. The results indicate that comparable nursing patterns may be associated with different plasma PRL levels, which are associated with different lengths of lactational amenorrhea. An early difference in the sensitivity of the breast-hypothalamus-pituitary system to suckling may explain the differences in the duration of lactational amenorrhea, which are not dependant on the breastfeeding pattern. The magnitude of the PRL response to suckling may predict the likelihood of recovering ovarian function during lactation. © 1989 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Rectal temperature was recorded from 22 mares at 0700, 1500 and 2300 h daily for seven days pre‐partum and one day post partum. A circadian variation in rectal temperature was present with the lowest temperature recorded at 0700 h. Because of this, the mares were divided into three groups based on time of parturition; those foaling between 0700 and 1500 h (n=2); between 1500 and 2300 h (n=13); and between 2300 and 0700 h (n=7). On the day prior to delivery (Day −1) the circadian pattern was absent because the nocturnal increase did not occur. A significant decrease in temperature was recorded prior to parturition in the group foaling between 1500 and 2300 h. A distinct decrease in temperature occurred in the majority of mares in the other two groups but this was not statistically significant. After parturition, rectal temperature increased to supranormal levels before returning to normal. © 1989 EVJ Ltd

AB  - Daily variation in maternal and fetal weight gain was measured in hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) and in mice (Mus musculus, C57Bl) with free access to food or under restricted feeding schedules. Pregnant hamsters with free access to food and water were weighed twice a day and fetuses were collected twice a day from 10.5 to 14.5 days after fertilization. In three experiments, pregnant mice were given free access to food and water or were allowed food for 12 hours a day or for 6 hours a day. Pregnant mice were weighed twice a day and in the restricted feeding experiments, fetuses were collected every 6 hours from 12.0 to 14.5 days after fertilization. Pregnant mice and hamsters with free access to food showed a daily rhythm in weight gain with greater gain at night. There was no evidence of a daily rhythm in the weight gain of hamster fetuses. Mouse fetuses showed greater weight gain during two 6‐hour intervals each day, the second half of each night and the second half of each day. The 12‐hour variation was seen in both wet and dry fetal weight. A 24‐hour rhythm in fetal growth was previously described in rats (Barr: Teratology, 7:283–288, 1973). Results in rats and mice indicate that fetal growth is modulated on a daily basis. The different periodicity observed in rats and mice might be related to the different ages of the fetuses examined.

AB  - To assess a potential underlying rhythm in the sensitivity of the pregnant primate myometrium to oxytocin we infused five pregnant rhesus monkeys (gestational age, 121-142 days) with oxytocin at three different periods of the 24-h day, in the order night, afternoon, and morning, via the maternal inferior vena cava. Oxytocin was administered for 1 min every 5 min over 30 min at four doses 400, 800, 2000, and 4000 pg/minkg. The response of the myometrium, evaluated as the number of contractions per pulse of oxytocin, was greatest in the early hours of darkness. Studies in three additional monkeys in which the order of the oxytocin challenge tests was changed, again showed that the response to oxytocin was greatest in the hours of darkness. We conclude that an underlying, as yet undefined, rhythm exists in the sensitivity of the pregnant primate myometrium to oxytocin at different times of the 24-h day. This change in myometrial sensitivity may be due to variation in one or more of the many potential regulatory sites of oxytocin’s action at the cellular level. We hypothesize that this difference in myometrial sensitivity to oxytocin plays a role in the switch from myometrial contractures to contractions that occurs around the hours of darkness, e.g. postsurgery, during food withdrawal, and before delivery. © 1989 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Abstract: We presented a report on four cases of juvenile parkinsonism with a marked diurnal fluctuation of symptoms and dystonia. Among parkinsonian signs, rigidity fluctuated the most and increasing rigidity by passive or active movements or emotional stress was observed. When we analyzed patients previously reported, in addition to bur own new patients, apart fnom the diurnal fluctuation and predominant occurrence in females, many similarities to Yokochi's third group of juvenile parkinsonism were found. In the previous reports, the patients with the marked fluctuation, of parkinsonian symptoms have not always shown dystonia. The changes of symptoms in relation to menstruation and pregnancy were other characteristic features in our three female patients. Here we proposed that for the present, it is preferable to call this disorder “juvenile parkinsonism with a marked diurnal fluctuation.” Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Treatment of female Sprague-Dawley rats with 15 or 25 mg/kg (IP) of methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) at gestational day 15 (15 DG) resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of total brain weight of the adult offspring. When tested for spontaneous activity in a residential maze over a 23 hour period, those animals treated with the highest dose of MAM showed an increase in both locomotion and local activity during night hours without changes in the structure of behavior. Animals treated with 15 mg/kg of MAM showed no difference in activity compared to controls despite a significant reduction in brain weight. © 1989.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if chronobiological manipulation of the environment through the use of skeletal photoperiods could enhance milk production of the dairy cow. Cows in their 8th mo of gestation were maintained in either a control light regimen (12 to 13 h continuous light) or three skeletal photoperiods exposed to a total of 8 h of light. Cows in the skeletal photoperiods received 6 h of light from 0500 to 1100 h and a 2 h light pulse between 1500 and 1700 h (pulse 1500 to 1700 h), 1800 and 2000 h (pulse 1800 to 2000 h), or 2100 and 2300 h (pulse 2100 to 2300 h). Cows were milked twice daily and milk weights recorded. Weekly milk samples were analyzed for fat, protein, lactose, and SCC. Milk progesterone was monitored for the first 60 d after calving to determine return to estrus. Total electrical consumption for lighting the different light regimens were monitored throughout the lactation. Cows in the light regimen of pulse 1800 to 2000 h exhibited a higher persistency of lactation and a higher feed efficiency than the cows in the other light regimens. There were no differences between treatments in milk fat, protein, lactose, or SCC. The total electricity used to light pulse 1800 to 2000 h was 50% less than that used to light the control light regimen. It is concluded that light is essential between 13 to 15 h after subjective dawn for increasing persistency of lactation. Further, milk production of the dairy cow can be profitably enhanced through the use of chronobiological principles. © 1989, American Dairy Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fetal death is a tragedy for mother, family, and obstetrician. Recent reviews of fetal death indicate that nearly half occur in pregnancies that are not candidates for traditional antepartum testing. We conducted a prospective evaluation of the effectiveness of a fetal movement screening program in reducing the fetal mortality rate. During a 7-month control period, 2519 deliveries occurred, no formal fetal movement assessment was done, and the fetal mortality rate was 8.7 per 1000 births. A pilot study was conducted to validate a protocol in which the patient was instructed to record the elapsed time required to appreciate 10 fetal movements. The mean time interval was 20.9 ± 18.1 minutes (mean ± SD). Patients in whom 2 hours elapsed without 10 fetal movements (mean + 5 SD) were to report to the delivery unit for further evaluation. During the study period, 1864 patients were delivered of infants and the fetal mortality rate was 2.1 per 1000 (x2 = 6.8, p &lt; 0.01). During the study period the number of antepartum tests performed increased by 13%. Interventions for fetal compromise prompted by inadequte fetal activity tripled in the study period, resulting in a drop in fetal mortality among patients with decreased movement from 44 to 10 per 1000. We conclude that the count-to-10 fetal movement screening program is simple and effective in reducing the fetal mortality rate. © 1989.

AB  - Catecholamine concentrations were measured in urine obtained from pregnant women to estimate the stress resulting from their lifestyles. Adrenaline and noradrenaline were analysed by high performance liquor chromatography (HPLC), creatinine was measured by Jaffe's method, and the catecholamine-creatinine ratio in urine was calculated. Adrenaline concentrations in 24-hour urine were higher in working women (n = 35) than non-working women (n = 20) (p less than 0.001) and the admission group (n = 20) (p less than 0.05), but noradrenaline concentrations showed no significant difference among three groups. Catecholamine concentrations were measured in 89 pregnant women three times in 24 hours. Marked circadian variations were observed with adrenaline and noradrenaline. Both concentrations were lowest in early morning, and increased after work (or evening) (p less than 2.0 X 10(-8)). Adrenaline concentrations were decreased on retiring to bed (p not equal to 1.0 X 10(-5)), while noradrenaline concentrations remained high until retiring to bed. There seems to be a relationship between catecholamine output and working or the familial factor. In working women (n = 53), noradrenaline concentrations were higher than in non-working women (n = 36) in early morning (p less than 0.05) and on retiring to bed (p less than 0.05). On the other hand, in women living with parents (n = 56), adrenaline concentrations were higher than those in women living without parents (n = 33) in early morning (p less than 0.05) and on retiring to bed (p less than 0.05). From these results, it may be concluded that working women or women living with parents are under much stress in their lives.

AB  - Growth hormone (GH) concentrations in serum were recorded in healthy women at different stages of normal pregnancy. Using a non-thrombogenic venous catheter and a portable pump, blood samples were collected at 30 min intervals for a period of 24 h. Growth hormone serum profiles were also established in non-pregnant women, women undergoing legal abortion and cesarean section and during spontaneous labor. A dramatic change in growth hormone secretion was demonstrated during late pregnancy when compared with the non-pregnant state. The pulsatile pattern, with intermittent high peaks and low or undetectable levels between peaks, characteristic of normal men and non-pregnant women, was completely suppressed. During late pregnancy, all investigated women evidenced increased, very stable serum levels of GH and there was no evidence of pulsatile activity. Two monoclonal antibodies directed against different epitopes on the GH-molecule were used in radio-immunoassays to distinguish the pituitary 22K-GH from other circulating GH variants. During the second half of pregnancy, a continuous secretion of a new placental GH variant and a concomitant suppression of the pulsatile pituitary GH secretion was demonstrated. The progressive transformation of GH secretion from a pulsatile into a stable, continuous pattern started at the end of the first trimester. After placental removal at cesarean section in late pregnancy there was a rapid fall in serum GH concentration, whereas levels were unaffected after legal abortion in the first trimester. These results and simultaneous measurements of hPL and hCG support the concept that a placental GH variant is produced during pregnancy. Studies on the diurnal variations of thyrotropin, prolactin and cortisol indicate that human pregnancy is associated with selective alterations in the secretion of pituitary hormones. The biological impact of continuous GH secretion was elucidated in two experimental systems in the rat. The pregnancy-associated murine protein-1 (PAMP-1) in rodents was previously believed to be regulated by sex steroids. However, a continuous infusion of hGH was found to increase the plasma concentration of PAMP-1 in non-pregnant, hypophysectomized female rats. On the other hand, intermittent hGH administration or estrogen treatment had no effect on this seemingly 'steroid-sensitive' protein. Steroid sulfatase activity in rat liver microsomes is another sexually differentiated function. Likewise, this system was found to be regulated by the mode of GH administration. A continuous GH secretion during human pregnancy can alter maternal liver metabolism and have important implications for the physiological adjustment to gestation.

AB  - Experiments were performed to determine whether the restraint stress-induced decrease of the nocturnal prolactin (PRL) surge affected the length of pseudopregnancy (PSP) and/or the outcome of pregnancy in rats. Vaginal cycles were monitored daily and animals were electro-mechanically cervically stimulated on the morning of metestrus to induce PSP. Animals were restraint stressed by tying the hind legs together with plastic coated bell wire beginning on day 1 of PSP from 0100-0700h with reapplication of stress at 0400h for 6-9 days and then blood sampled for PRL and progesterone plasma levels. Restraint stress significantly decreased plasma PRL (P < 0.001) and progesterone (P < 0.05) levels. The length of PSP was significantly decreased (P < 0.01) for restraint animals and for control animals that were blood sampled compared to control animals that were not sampled. In the pregnancy experiment, animals were mated upon arrival into the laboratory and assigned to one of our four groups. For the restraint group, stress was initiated on day 1 of pregnancy as indicated by the presence of sperm in the vaginal lavage. Animals were stressed for 6-9 days for 6 hours during the nocturnal PRL surge as described above. One control group had no treatment; a second control group was sampled only, and a third control group was injected daily with pimozide, a dopamine antagonist, and stressed for 6-9 days. The group which received no treatment had significantly greater (P < 0.05) incidence of successful pregnancy compared to the other 3 groups; there were no differences (P > 0.05) between the sampled, restraint and restraint + pimozide groups in the incidence of successful pregnancy. We conclude that restraint stress during the nocturnal PRL surge minimally affects the length of PSP and that the effect of stress on the outcome of pregnancy is not due to the decrease in nocturnal PRL surge. © 1989.

AB  - The serum and amniotic fluid concentrations of melatonin (MT) were measured by RIA during human labor in different conditions related to the type of delivery and the time of the day of delivery. Serum MT concentrations displayed a normal diurnal rhythm, resembling that of nongravid women; the mean concentration [163.8 ± 149.6 (±SD) pmol/L] at night was significantly (P < 0.001) higher than that during the day (31.4 ± 16.3 pmol/L). The amniotic fluid MT concentration, which showed a significant positive correlation to the serum MT concentration (r = 0.625; P < 0.01), also showed an obvious diurnal rhythm; the mean MT concentration was significantly (P < 0.01) higher during the night [99.3 ± 59.3 (±SD) pmol/L] than during the day (58.9 ± 33.5 pmol/L). Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography confirmed that the amniotic fluid MT immunoreactivity eluated as synthetic MT. During the night the mean amniotic fluid MT concentration [99.3 ± 59.3 (±SD) pmol/L] was significantly (P < 0.01) lower than that in serum (178.9 ± 189.6 pmol/L). The progress of delivery, estimated by cervical dilatation, did not affect serum MT concentrations. Induction of delivery by amniotomy and/or oxytocin, and operative delivery by cesarean section had no effect on serum MT concentrations. Human MT secretion does not seem to be influenced by the physical stress of labor or endocrine changes associated with parturition. The single factor regulating MT secretion during human delivery appears to be the time of day. © 1989 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of a simplified method to detect the LH rise. The mean plus two standard deviations of the LH values in the preovulatory period was 6.70 ± 3.45 mIU/mL in a group of women in whom at least one mature oocyte fertilized and cleaved. For practical purposes, an absolute LH value of 15 mIU/mL was considered the start of the rise using the LH graph, and was designated the LH rise value. In 76 patients who experienced a spotaneous LH surge (detected by daily sampling at 08:00, 15:00, 23:00), oocyte recovery was timed for 32 to 35 hours after the LH rise using this simplified method. The outcome of IVF-ET in these patients was comparable to that of the control patients in whom hCG was administered. Graphs were drawn retrospectively using only two (08:00 and 23:00) LH values obtained for each day for each patient and the start of the LH rise was plotted. Most patients (66%) would have had oocyte recovery at the same time whether they had two or three daily LH values. The remaining patients would still have undergone oocyte recovery at an acceptable time (within ± 6 hours). It was concluded that this simple method accurately identifies the onset of the spontaneous LH rise and may be effected by twice-daily LH sampling.

AB  - Plasma PRL concentration shows a circadian variation in fetal and adult sheep. In the adult sheep the presence of this variation depends on the season. In this paper we investigated whether season affects the presence of the circadian variation of PRL in the fetal sheep. To that effect we measured plasma PRL concentration every 2 h for 24 h during summer, fall, and winter in three groups of fetal sheep whose gestational ages ranged from 125-133 days. Mean (± SEM) fetal plasma PRL concentrations were 352.8 ± 65.0 ng/ml during summer (n = 6), 98.7 ± 12.9 during fall (n = 8), and 10.5 ± 2.6 during winter (n = 4). A 24-h variation of plasma PRL was detected during summer [PRL (ng/ml) = 352.8 ± 85.2 cos 15 (t - 18.5); P = 0.007] and fall [PRL (ng/ml) = 98.7 + 26.6 cos 15 (t - 23.6); P = 0.041] but not during winter. The mesor and amplitude of the variation are higher in summer than in fall, and the acrophases differ by 5 h, taking place at dusk in summer and close to midnight in fall. These findings show that in fetal sheep, PRL responds to seasons in utero. The signal triggering this response is most likely photoperiod. © 1989 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Nuñoa is a high altitude rural Peruvian community characterized by socioeconomic stratification and differential access to the market economy. Nursing practices and the effects of nursing are also stratified; this translates into a risk of menses at 12 months post-partum nearly seven times greater in wealthier than in poorer women. Most nursing occurs in the morning, among those who practise on-demand breast-feeding. Nursing episodes are clustered into sessions; the amount of breast-feeding is regulated by varying the number of episodes per session rather than by changing the duration of suckling episodes or the frequency of sessions per hour. Thus, resumption of ovulation is not dependent on the variable spacing of nursing episodes or sessions. The components of nursing activity most likely to be responsible for variation in the duration of post-partum amenorrhoea in these nursing women are mean session duration and mean number of episodes per session. The mean duration of morning nursing sessions is negatively associated with infant's age, reflecting the greater reliance of younger children on breast-milk. The mean duration of afternoon nursing sessions is positively associated with mother's age, independent of infant's age, possibly reflecting maternal age-related variation in milk production capabilities. Baby minding by older daughters may also help to explain variation in afternoon nursing. © 1989, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Contemporary screening programmes for early breast cancer based on X-rays (mammography) are very expensive and have two serious limitations in their potential to control the disease. First, soft-tissue radiology imaging is poor at resolving a tumour in the youngest third of cancer patients because of breast density; second, by the time size of a tumour enables a diagnosis to be made, there are already hundreds of thousands of malignant cells; depending on the particular biology of the tumour they may have disseminated. For effective control of the disease there must be some understanding of breast cancer biology so that appropriate pre-cancer therapeutic strategies can be implemented. There is persuasive evidence from the growth kinetics of excised tumours; the prognosis of the breast cancer process; the protection afforded by an early first pregnancy; the age-related sensitivity to diagnostic X-rays; and, the age-correlated presence of oestrogen receptors in tumours, that the genesis of cancer is usually in the pre-menopause (the second or third decade). Breast cancer prevention programmes have to take this early genesis into their reckoning. Also, to see any progenitor or pre-cancerous lesions the histopathologist must look in the cancer mastectomy specimens of the younger patient. When this is done, such mastectomies reveal multiple benign focal hyperplasias and cysts very much more numerous than in age-matched consecutive autopsy breasts. These abnormalities may represent a failure of acinisation and an abnormal maturation pathway with a large number of uncommitted epithelial cells vulnerable to mutation since they are not fully differentiated. © 1989 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - Effects of photoperiod and type of grain were assessed using 47 cows (wk 1; 59.5 d of lactation) exposed daily to 16 h of light (long day) and fed randomly one of two diets containing an equal amount of cracked corn or rolled barley. During wk 5, cows were assigned within each diet to long day and ad libitum feeding, short day (8 h of light: 2 h of dark: 2 h of light: 12 h of dark) and ad libitum feeding, or long day and ad libitum feeding (wk 5 to 8) followed by pair feeding with short day cows between wk 9 and 16. Milk composition was not affected by treatments. Between wk 9 and 16, long day cows fed for ad libitum consumption or pair fed produced 5 to 11% more milk than cows exposed to short day; feed intake of long day cows fed for ad libitum consumption was greater than short day and long day pair fed cows. Milk yield and total feed intake were not affected by type of grain in the diet. In conclusion, long day photoperiod increased milk yield and feed intake. Feeding cows from peak of lactation with barley or corn in total mixed rations did not affect milk production. © 1989, American Dairy Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bilateral testicular tumours are a rare but well described complication of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It can be extremely difficult to distinguish histologically between Leydig cell tumours and adrenocortical rest hyperplasia which may lead in some cases to unnecessary orchidectomy in young men. A 26‐year‐old male in whom CAH had been diagnosed neonatally, was referred for further investigation of a craggy mass in the left testis. Six months earlier, right orchidectomy had been performed after presentation with bilateral enlarged, hard testes and azoospermia. The tumour was interpreted to be a malignant interstitial cell tumour of the testis. Our investigations revealed that his CAH was inadequately controlled and that the hormonal secretion from the remaining left testicular mass was ACTH dependent. Percutaneous venous sampling revealed high concentrations of Cortisol and other adrenocortical hormones coming from the gonadal vein. Dexamethasone suppressed these adrenal hormones and reduced the size and softened the consistency of the testicular mass. Total disappearance of the mass was achieved by using dexamethasone, given in a reverse circadian rhythm regimen. Spermatogenesis returned and the patient's wife became pregnant after 6 months; she gave birth to a normal male infant. To our knowledge, this is the first time in this clinical setting that fertility has been achieved. This case highlights the need for both a functional and histological assesement of such ‘tumours’ in CAH prior to orchidectomy. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Two surges of PRL designated as nocturnal (N) and diurnal (D) are observed during early pregnancy. The present study was undertaken to determine the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in regulating these PRL surges. On day 7 of pregnancy intracarotid catheters were implanted, and blood samples were obtained at 0200 and 0400 h on day 8 and between midnight and 0600 h on day 9 to monitor the N surge. Rats were killed by decapitation, brains were quickly removed, frozen on dry ice, and stored at -70 C until later determination of indole and catecholamines. Pretreatment 24 h earlier with para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA; 250 mg/kg BW), an inhibitor of 5-HT biosynthesis, did not affect the N PRL surge, although the hypothalamic concentrations of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid were greatly reduced. On the other hand, administration at 2400 h of ketanserin (KET; 10 mg/kg BW, ip) or LY-53857 (5 mg/kg BW, ip), two selective 5-HT2 antagonists, significantly (P &lt; 0.025 for KET and P &lt; 0.01 for LY-53857) reduced the N PRL surge. Neither KET nor LY- 53857 altered the hypothalamic content of biogenic amines compared to that in saline-treated controls. Intravenous treatment with LY-53857 (1 mg/kg) at 0200 h after the onset of the N surge induced no change in plasma PRL levels compared to those in controls. To test whether 5-HT plays a role in the D surge, rats were decapitated at 1800 h after drug injection. Pretreatment with the same dose of PCPA (24 h), KET (2 h), or LY-53857 (2 h) that was given to rats in the N surge study significantly (P &lt; 0.01) reduced plasma PRL levels. As observed in the N study, PCPA greatly diminished the hypothalamic content of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, and also reduced dopamine, but to a much lesser extent than 5-HT. It is concluded that 5-HT contributes significantly to the generation of the D surge. Its role during the N surge remains uncertain due to the contradictory effects of the synthesis inhibitor PCPA and the receptor antagonists KET and LY-53857. © 1989 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - In 16 normal pregnancies the relationship between the blood flow velocity waveform and fetal behavioral states at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation was studied. Whereas behavioral state independency was established for the acceleration time, peak flow velocity demonstrated a statistically significant reduction during active sleep, compared with quiet sleep. These data reflect reduced ductal flow and suggest a redistribution in the left-ventricular and right-ventricular output in favor of the left side of the heart during active sleep. Peak flow velocities in the fetal ductus arteriosus were independent of fetal heart rate. © 1989.

AB  - This study examined changes in the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the stalk-median eminence (SME) and posterior pituitary (PP) during the preovulatory PRL surge. Immature female rats were injected with PMSG on day 28. Blood PRL levels were low on the morning of day 30, rose to a peak from 1400–1600 h, remained at a lower plateau from 1800–2400 h, and declined to basal levels on the morning of day 31. SME, PP, and striatum were removed from PMSG-treated rats at selected times during the periovulatory period and from agematched control rats. TH activity was determined in tissue homogenates by a coupled hydroxylation-decarboxylation assay. Apparent Km and maximum velocity values with respect to 6-methyl tetrahydropterine were estimated from substrate saturation curves. The kinetic parameters for TH in either the SME or the PP of control rats were similar at 1100 and 1800 h on day 30. However, the apparent Km in both tissues was significantly lower than that in the striatum. The affinity of TH in the SME and PP was unchanged before and during the peak phase of the PRL surge, reduced significantly during the late plateau, and returned to presurge levels on the morning of day 31. TH activity in the striatum was similar at all times examined. To determine the state of activation of the enzyme, tissue homogenates were preincubated with cAMP, ATP, and magnesium. TH activity in the SME during the peak phase was unchanged by cAMP, and that in the PP was modestly increased. The relatively inactive enzyme in both tissues during the plateau phase was markedly activated by a cAMP-dependent mechanism. The low affinity of striatal TH was greatly increased by cAMP at both times. These data suggest that TH in the SME and PP exists in an activated state most of the time and is transiently inactivated during the plateau phase of the PRL surge. In contrast, TH in the striatum is relatively inactive in the basal state and is not affected by hormonal changes induced by PMSG. We conclude that the peak PRL surge occurs in spite of active dopamine (DA) neurons, suggesting that it is generated by a nondopaminergic mechanism. Decreased TH activity in DA neurons in the SME and PP may prolong the PRL surge during the plateau phase, whereas increased DA activity coincides with the termination of the surge. © 1989 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Fetal rapid eye movements (REM), breathing movements (BM), and trunk movements (TM) were observed through the use of 3 ultrasonic real‐time scanners. Each movement was recorded with the event marker and quantitatively analyzed in relation to the development of the sleep‐wakefulness cycle by a computer‐assisted system. The results were as follows: The number of REM increased with gestational age. The appearance rate of REM reached a certain level after 32 weeks of gestation. REM— non‐REM rhythm was distinguished after 32 weeks. The relationship between REM and BM increased with gestational age. The occurrence of each TM has no correlation to that of REM when it was analyzed in short‐term units, but the incidence of TM was high in REM periods. These results demonstrate the course of the development of sleep‐wakefulness cycle in human fetuses. © 1989 Japanese Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology

AB  - Pregnant albino rats were treated during the eighth day of gestation (GD 8), with two IP injections, spaced by 4 hours, of either ethanol (2.9 g/kg in 24% v/v saline solution) or saline. Maternal blood alcohol levels reached a peak of 457 mg/dl 60 min after the second dose. At the age of 45 days, an equal number of male and female offspring were injected with 3.5 g/kg ethanol and sleep time and blood ethanol levels were determined upon awakening. Ethanol metabolic rate was studies in other individuals injected with the same dose of ethanol and the slope of the linear descending portion of the curves was calculated. Animals that received ethanol in utero exhibited shorter sleep time and higher blood ethanol levels at the moment of awakening than controls. The rate of ethanol metabolism was similar in both groups. These results show that an acute intoxication with ethanol during GD 8 induced long-term changes in the CNS of offspring which caused reduced sensitivity to ethanol hypnotic effects. © 1989.

AB  - Two different rhythms exist in the fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern of a full-term fetus. These rhythms seem to be related to the rhythms associated with sleep and wakefulness, but the results are not yet conclusive. In this study, at first, the states of sleep and wakefulness in newborn infants (measured simultaneously by EEG, EOG, respiration and body movement) were compared with their heart rate patterns in rest, active, awake and unclassified phases. The results suggest that in newborn infants it is possible to distinguish quiet sleep from other states of sleep and wakefulness by means of the heart rate pattern alone. In the second part of the study, NST for three consecutive hours with 24 to 41 week pregnant women was performed and examined to determine the relationship between maturity and heart rate pattern (measured minute by minute in rest, active and unclassified phases) in their fetus. The findings suggest that the rest phase in a heart rate pattern of a fetus indicates the fetus to be in a state of quiet sleep. Further, the proportional increase and significant increase in the duration of the rest phase after 34 gestational week indicate the maturity of the central nervous system of the fetus.

AB  - To evaluate whether mouthing movement in the human fetus is related to advance in gestational age and whether such movement is concurrent with rapid eye movement or non-rapid eye movement phases, 26 fetuses from 28 to 41 weeks' gestation were observed for 60 continuous minutes with real-time ultrasonography. It was evident that regular mouthing movement every 300 to 600 msec concurred with the non-rapid eye movement period, from 35 weeks' gestation to term. Random mouthing movements that occurred at a wide range of intervals from 300 msec to approximately 525 seconds were observed predominantly during the rapid eye movement period and were unrelated to advance in gestational age. These observations were discussed in relation to biologic implications. © 1989.

AB  - Pregnant Long-Evans hooded rats were dosed via injections into the gum with 3, 6, or 9 mg/kg lidocaine, or vehicle, or were uninjected, on gestational day 4 (GD4), GD11, or GD18. Offspring (8-11 litters/group) were tested on a variety of tests of behavioral development and adult behavior. No effects of any dose at any time of administration were found upon maternal weight gain in gestation, litter size, or initial birth weight or weight gain of the pups. Administration at GD4 produced few effects; only footshock sensitivity showed a significant effect of dosing, although there were trends toward dosing effects on spontaneous alternation. For administration on GD11, lidocaine was associated with slight but significant alterations in sex ratios, and a trend toward drug effects on development of spontaneous alternation. Vehicle administration at this age reduced barbiturate sleep time in offspring and slightly altered footshock sensitivity. Lidocaine dosing on GD18 was associated with a number of significant alterations of behavior, including visual discrimination, shuttlebox avoidance, tail flick, and water maze errors; there were also both vehicle and lidocaine effects on water maze latencies. These data reinforce our previous report that lidocaine may be a behavioral teratogen, and suggest that administration in later gestation in the rat may alter a broader range of behaviors than earlier in gestation. © 1989.

AB  - During the past fifteen years the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has become widely recognized as a quite common disorder with a wide range of serious clinical complications (1, 2, 3). This syndrome arises as a result of sleep related changes in upper airway muscle function and progressive narrowing of the oropharyngeal lumen. The resulting hypoxia (or asphyxia) leads to an arousal response that terminates the initial obstructive event. The exact incidence and prevalence of OSAS is currently unknown. Lavie (4) concluded its prevalence to be 1.26 percent. Others (5, 6) found that the prevalence of heavy regular snoring (taken as an index of at least a partially obstructed airway) increased with age including 40 percent of women and 50 percent of men over 60 years of age. Polygraphically documented OSAS showed incidence of 0.99 percent in an unselected population. Postmenopausal women have frequent episodes of OSA in contrast with their premenopausal counterparts, who very rarely have any apnea. Since we could not find in the literature any documented OSAS studies in pregnancy, we would like to base our hypothesis on our previously published clinical observations and our recent findings. In the present paper we would like to suggest that pathophysiologic changes of OSAS prolonged throughout many weeks of pregnancy may have an adverse effect upon the feto-placental unit. © 1989.

AB  - Eleven healthy fetuses between 36 and 39 weeks of gestation were studied during the active sleep state to examine effects of a 5-s vibratory acoustic stimulus on the baseline fetal heart rate and flow velocity waveform in the fetal internal carotid artery. There was an immediate marked rise in baseline fetal heart rate with concomitant drop in pulsatility index in the flow velocity waveform of the fetal internal carotid artery, which persisted for at least 15 min after the stimulus. However, when the pulsatility index was standardized for a fetal heart rate of 140 beats/min this index remained virtually unaltered. These data suggest that in the healthy term fetus during active sleep state, a vibratory acoustic stimulus has no measurable effect on cerebral vascular resistance. Since virtually all reported studies on vibratory acoustic stimulation of the fetus were carried-out during the quiet sleep state, the data from the present study do not provide any information on the safety of this device when employed as a means of assessing of fetal well-being. © 1989.

AB  - Kidney size was measured ultrasonographically in a cross-sectional study of 612 foetuses. Values of the length (Nlgs), width (Nqu), thickness (Nap) as well as cross-sectional area (Nqu-Fl) of the kidney were calculated by statistical means and correlated to gestational age. Because of the great biological variance, the ratio of kidney length and width to the thorax width and the ratio of kidney area to the thorax area, was calculated and the standard deviation was found to be very small. The ratios for growth-retarded and macrosomic foetuses from diabetic mothers were examined. The results are discussed and the syndromes, which is often associated with renal abnormality are tabulated.

AB  - Sensitivity to alcohol may influence the severity of ethanol teratogenesis. To examine this hypothesis, the teratogenic effects of ethanol were compared in Long‐Sleep (LS) and Short‐Sleep (SS) mice, selectively bred for differences in ethanol‐induced narcosis. Inbred C57BL/6J (B6) mice were included to confirm previously reported teratogenic effects using our own treatment regimen and standard assessment techniques. Intragastric administration of ethanol (5.8 g/kg) on Days 9 and 10 of pregnancy resulted in growth retardation and an increase in prenatal mortality in LS litters but not in SS litters. Therefore, alcohol sensitivity plays a role in the severity of prenatal alcohol effects. B6 mice showed more ethanol teratogenicity than either LS or SS mice, even though maternal blood ethanol levels were similar across genotypes. This result suggests genetic variations other than alcohol sensitivity also influence ethanol teratogenesis. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Sperm-positive female Long-Evans hooded rats were dosed subcutaneously with 10 mg/kg/day cocaine or an equal volume of vehicle (0.9% sterile saline) from gestation day 4 (GD4) through GD18. Offspring were assessed for development of negative geotaxis, righting reflex, spontaneous alternation, and open field activity, and for adult behaviors including DRL-20 acquisition, water maze, visual discrimination, barbiturate sleep time, shuttlebox avoidance, footshock sensitivity, and tail flick latency. Cocaine dosing produced no significant effects on dam weight gain, any measure of litter size and weight, or early postnatal behavioral tests, but there were significant drug effects on development of spontaneous alternation, development of open field activity, DRL-20 acquisition, water maze performance, tail flick, and footshock sensitivity. These data suggest that chronic administration of a modest dose of cocaine during gestation in the rat alters a number of behaviors in the offspring. © 1989.

AB  - Plasma alpha-fetoprotein was measured each week for 28 days on 132 preterm babies who were admitted to an intensive care unit. Reference values were established on 53 of these infants who were relatively normal and whose gestations ranged from 29 to 33.9 weeks. Similar studies were done on 79 of the 132 infants with comparable gestational ages who suffered from hyaline membrane disease, transient tachypnoea, recurrent apnoea or growth retardation. Plasma AFP was significantly raised in those with recurrent apnoea but a reason was not established for this observation. The risk of apnoea persisted until AFP levels had reached the reference range. Infants with hyaline membrane disease had lower levels of plasma AFP than the recurrent apnoea group but significantly higher values than controls. Babies who are liable to develop recurrent apnoea can probably be identified at birth as their plasma AFP is exceptionally high. These conclusions refer only to babies who receive a maintenance dose of theophylline from the first week. © 1989.

AB  - EDITORIAL COMMENT: Backache is an important common symptom in pregnancy although usually the topic is listed in textbooks with the other so called ‘Minor Disorders’. This paper evaluates the frequency of backache, its relationship to insomnia and its relief with a locally designed pillow. Unfortunately the ‘minor’ non‐lifethreatening disorders of pregnancy receive scant attention in medical journals, yet not only do they prevent patients enjoying their pregnancy (which should be the ideal), but they can be one reason for patients opting for induction of labour at term, when there is no bonaflde indication for such interference. The same is true of intractable ‘heartburn’ which is another cause of insomnia in late pregnancy. Although the authors provide much detail and many tables they did not tackle the difficult problems of type of backache, radiation of pain, need for analgesia and rest during the day. When backache is severe and incapacitating the patient should be referred for orthopaedic opinion, especially if the pain radiates to the leg along the distribution of one or more of the sciatic nerve roots. A visit to the physiotherapist for education and appropriate exercises is usually of more value than referral to an orthopaedic surgeon. However, the latter must be consulted in the rare patient (less than 1 in 1,000) with intractable pain, or coexistent neurological signs. In most patients backache is relieved by rest, usually in the lateral position, although some women who do not suffer from postural hypotension are more comfortable on their back, on a firm mattress. Backache after pregnancy is also an important problem; if still present at the postnatal visit, the patient's symptoms, morale and abdominal shape are often helped by exercises supervised by a physiotherapist. Summary: The effect of a wedge‐shaped pillow (Ozzlo pillow) was compared with a standard hospital pillow, used to support the abdomen of a pregnant woman while lying on her side, in preventing or alleviating backache and backache‐related insomnia; 92 women at 36 weeks' gestation completed the study. Backache was found to be very common (87%), the onset of pain occurring before 29 weeks in 59%. Age, parity, previous backache and type of bed used did not correlate with the backache scores during the period of study. Lower scores for backache were recorded by women in the week they used the Ozzlo pillow compared with the week they used the standard pillow. Sleeping was deemed better by the patient with the Ozzlo pillow, though actual sleeping scores did not corroborate this. While significantly more felt the Ozzlo pillow was superior to a standard pillow for backache and sleeping, some found both methods helpful. The simple measure of supporting the abdomen with a pillow when in lateral recumbency is likely to benefit many women in late pregnancy. A wedge‐shaped pillow of the Ozzlo type, conforming to the shape of the abdomen and supporting it more closely, may be of greater help than a standard cushion or pillow.

AB  - A total of 14 healthy pregnant women between 37 and 41 weeks' gestational age were studied to determine the effects of a 5-second external vibratory stimulus (100 Hz, square wave) on human fetal behavioral states. Fetal behavioral state observations were made with simultaneous recordings of fetal heart rate, gross fetal body movements, and fetal eye movement between 8:30 Am and 4:00 PM. During the first episode of behavioral state 1 F (quiet sleep state) ?10 minutes duration on two consecutive half days, the vibratory stimulus was placed on the surface of the maternal abdomen over the fetal head. Each fetus received one 5-second vibratory stimulus during either the first or second half day of observation. The time at which the instrument was applied but no vibratory stimulus was administered was considered as the control period. All women were then observed for 2 hours after the control period and after stimulation. A transition period from a quiet sleep state to a stable active sleep state (state 2F, rapid eye movement sleep) averaged ≤3 minutes after stimulation, as compared with 23 minutes after the control period. These changes in fetal behavioral states persisted for 20 minutes after vibratory stimulation. There also was an immediate and sustained increase in long-term fetal heart rate variability, the number of fetal heart rate accelerations and gross fetal body movement during the first 20 minutes after stimulus, without changes in basal fetal heart rate. We hypothesize that changes in fetal behavior seen after application of low frequency vibratory stimulus are more physiologic than the profound changes in fetal heart rate and gross fetal body movement previously described after vibratory acoustic stimulation with an electronic artificial larynx. © 1989.

AB  - One hundred women responded to a questionnaire dealing with night backache during pregnancy. All the women were in the second half of their pregnancy. Sixty seven per cent of the women reported discomfort and/or backache during the night. We hypothesize that hypervolemia combined with obstruction of the inferior vena cava, caused by the enlarging uterus, is the underlying pathomechanism leading to night backache. Patients with inadequate venous collateral circulation may develop excessive pressure within the venous system, the vertebral bodies and overdistension of venous channels distal to the occluded zone. These changes may lead to hypoxemia, metabolic disturbances, irritation of unmyelinated nerves and result in night backache.

AB  - Thirteen healthy pregnant women between 37 and 41 weeks' gestational age were studied to examine effects of a 5-second external vibratory stimulus (100 Hz, square wave) on fetal heart rate, fetal breathing, and gross fetal body movement patterns. All fetuses were stimulated during an episode of low fetal heart rate variability (mean minute range ≤32 milliseconds for ≥ minutes) lasting at least 5 minutes. There was an immediate and sustained increase in long-term FHR variability, number of FHR accelerations, and gross fetal body movements after stimulation. Fetuses made breathing movements more irregularly after vibratory stimulus. We hypothesize that external low-frequency vibratory stimulus, applied during episodes of low fetal heart rate variability, causes a change from a state of quiet sleep to a state of rapid-eye-movement sleep in healthy term fetuses. © 1989.

AB  - Fifty-seven infants exposed to phencyclidine (PCP) in utero were followed for the first year of life. Thirty-six (65%) of the 55 for whom birth records were available manifested symptoms of neonatal narcotic withdrawal syndrome, including 16 (52%) of those whose mothers denied opiate abuse during pregnancy. Temperament problems were noted in 47% of the babies and sleep problems in 14%. The majority of infants grew normally, but a larger than expected number started out small and remained small. Testing using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at age one year revealed a mental development index (mean ±SD) of 94±10 and a psychomotor development index of 98±10. Attachment behavior was abnormal in 17%. Most infants were cared for by their natural mother. Further studies are needed to determine later effects of in utero PCP exposure, as well as effects on the infants being raised by women who have used PCP. Phencyclidine toxicity needs to be considered when evaluating babies with signs of neonatal narcotic withdrawal syndrome.

AB  - This chapter discusses the role of temporal factors in infant behavior and development. It reviews infant's behavioral rhythmicities and responsiveness to temporally organized stimulation. Temporal change may occur over vastly different orders of magnitude; however, organisms display a remarkable degree of adaptation to temporal variations. Periodicity in physiological and behavioral functions is a ubiquitous property of biological systems. In humans periodicity that ranges across orders of magnitude may be observed in a variety of functions even prior to birth. As early as the 21st week of gestation and continuing right to the end of gestation fetuses exhibit cyclicity in their movements. Newborn infants produce repetitive motions anywhere between every 30 seconds and 8 minutes. With regard to other periodic functions, a rhythmicity in sleep states can be observed as early as the 32nd week of life in preterm infants. Temporal factors play a critical role in social interactions, whether they involve communicative or non-communicative acts. In communicative acts, infants exhibit impressive capacities for regulating their behavior in social interchanges with their caregivers. © 1989 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

AB  - The role of peripheral chemoreceptors in the circulatory adaptation to hypoxia and the effects of rapid-eye-movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep and breathing activity on organ blood flow were assessed in fetal sheep. Blood flow was measured with isotope-labeled microspheres on intact, vagotomized (VX), and sinoaortic-denervated (SAD) fetuses. Denervation did not change the biventricular cardiac output (Biv. CO) or organ blood flows during normoxia. In intact fetuses the blood flow was increased during hypoxemia in brain, adrenals, and heart but not in kidneys, skeletal muscles, or placenta. The increase in organ blood flow during hypoxemia was reduced in the VX group and even more in SAD fetuses, but in the latter group, blood flow was still increased in midbrain, medulla, pons, skeletal muscles, and heart. Sleep states per se did not significantly affect the blood flow to any organs tested. However, the Biv. CO and blood flow to all organs except kidneys and adrenals was increased during fetal breathing in REM sleep. We conclude that 1) during moderate hypoxemia both aortic and carotid bodies plus an additional mechanism are involved in redistributing fetal blood flow, and 2) changes in organ perfusion during REM sleep are due to concomitant fetal breathing.

AB  - Two babies with congenital difficulties in swallowing and breathing are presented and contrasted. Both were associated with maternal polyhydramnios, but one was due to medullary infarction and the other to a malformation (“neurocristopathy”). In the former case, isolated tenth and twelfth cranial nerve palsies provided the clue as to the correct etiology, whereas the latter baby had dyscoordination of swallowing and breathing with sleep apnea (“Ondine's curse”). It is somewhat ironic that the case without a difficult delivery had the infarct, probably prenatal in onset, whereas the one with a difficult delivery had the congenital malformation. Neural crest cells are known to migrate widely and to develop greatly different functions, but the fact that their central associations of neural tube origin may also be affected has not previously been emphasized in the etiopathogenesis of the congenital malformation. A variety of syndromes with combinations of many defects may be seen in which too many or too few cells are formed, with more or less serious consequences especially for the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems.

AB  - Summary The behaviour of 3‐year‐old children born preterm was compared with that of full‐term children of the same age. The preterm group were born between 32 and 37 weeks gestation, and weighed between 1500 g and 2500 g at birth, and thus (in comparison to even earlier, lower birth weight babies) comprised a ‘low risk’ group. The children and their mothers were interviewed at home and information obtained about the following: behaviour, the number of accidents requiring medical attention, language development, maternal mental health and demographic data, the preterm group did not show an excess of behaviour problems overall but they did show significantly more problems when certain individual behaviours were considered, namely sleep related problems, tempers and dependence. The preterm group had also had significantly more accidents. The nature of the behavioural differences suggested they represented styles of parental management rather than neurological impairment in the preterm group. There was no evidence of language delay in either group and no significant association between child behaviour and maternal mental health. This study showed that consideration of socioeconomic factors is important. Children from manual socioeconomic groups showed significantly more behaviour problems than children from non‐manual groups, and mothers from manual groups had significantly poorer mental health.

AB  - A pair of preterm, opposite-sex twins were examined during the lying-in period for behavioral and morphological effects of maternal alcohol and pentazocine abuse during pregnancy. A few morphological features typical of fetal alcohol syndrome were observed in each infant, and the male infant only was above the standardized mean in minor physical anomalies. The male's behavioral scores were more likely to be deviant from the standardized mean than the female's. Specifically, the male was more irritable, both spontaneously and in response to specific stimuli; highly active while awake and handled for the presentation of stimuli; more active than average during sleep; and low on ratings that reflect the attitude of the examiner toward the infant. These findings imply individual and gender differences in behavioral susceptibility to teratogens.

AB  - A long-term fluoroscopic study was performed on pregnant ewes over several lambing seasons to determine the nature of sheep fetal behaviour. This study led to the recognition of the phenomenon of fetal pandiculation, which is essentially similar to the post-natal pandiculation now seen as a comparative phenomenon of systematic stretching. The characteristic features of fetal pandiculation have now been studied in general form and as specific components in the fetuses of 22 ewes. Thirty-three events of full pandiculation were detected in 25 episodes in 222 observations. The extant definition of pandiculation was used as the frame of reference for the phenomenon as follows: "An instinctive movement, consisting in the extension of the legs, the raising and stretching of the arms and the throwing back of the head and trunk, accompanied by yawning". In addition, extension of the axial skeleton and vigour were taken as further definitive features of full pandiculation. The phenomenon has both form and composition. In form, various salient features can be identified as typical. In the order approximating their consistency of expression in the phenomenon, they include: (I) pattern; (II) direction; (III) elongation and extension; (IV) polarity; (V) episodic occurrence. Since these features occur in the majority of cases, they can be taken as identifying the general form of major pandiculation. No episode of fetal pandiculation incorporated all of the characteristic components. A score was made of the numbers of components occurring per episode; scores ranged from 6 to 8, to a maximum of 9. The modal average was 7. Additional features included: (a) temporal distribution - distribution was even throughout the period of gestation studied (2-20 days pre-partum); (b) incidence per fetus - full pandiculation was usually encountered in each fetus on only one or two occasions; (c) partial pandiculation - this was recognised when the components were reduced in expression of vigour or in number. Partial, incomplete and minor pandiculations collectively numbered 63, and exceeded full pandiculations in incidence. Fetal pandiculation could be related to the ends of fetal somnolent states and may be a marker of transitional phases between sleep and alert states. It can therefore indicate that the phasic nature of fetal processes is being sustained normally and may thus indicate that the status of the fetus is satisfactory in general respects. Viewed in a wider, comparative light, fetal pandiculation could be regarded as a simple signal of adequate well-being which could be identified by non-invasive methods. It is clear that the phenomenon calls for appropriate attention in further work. The pursuit of research into fetal behaviour can be a profitable branch of fetology. © 1989.

AB  - Cerebral oxidative metabolism and regional blood flow were studied, with changes in behavioral state over the immediate perinatal period, to determine the change in cerebral metabolism at birth and the relationship to behavioral activity. Nine unanesthetized fetal sheep (139-142 days gestation) were each studied during a period of high-voltage and low-voltage electrocorticogram (ECOG) activity and then again after cesarean delivery at 2 h of age while awake and at 24 h of age while awake and during a period of high-voltage ECOG sleep. Preductal arterial and sagittal vein blood samples were analyzed for O2 content, blood gases, and pH. Blood flow was measured with a radioactive microsphere technique. Cerebral oxidative metabolism showed no significant perinatal change, although a coupling to behavioral state was evident with significant increases during both the perinatal low-voltage ECOG state and the awake state at 24 h. Blood flow to the brain showed a significant perinatal decrease after birth and state-related increases during both the prenatal low-voltage ECOG state and the awake state at 24 h consistent with the tight coupling of flow and/or O2 delivery to metabolic needs reported for normal brain tissue. The cerebral metabolic rate of the prenatal low-voltage ECOG state suggested a level of functional excitation comparable with that of the awake state after birth, supporting the importance of the rapid-eye-movement (REM) state mechanism as a source of endogenous stimulation during the perinatal period of brain growth and development.

AB  - EDITORIAL COMMENT: This paper was accepted for publication because it reminded us of how little data are available on such matters of importance. The only comparable obstetric topic that comes to mind is the long‐term effect, on both spouses and their children, of the presence of the male at his partner's confinement. The mother's second pregnancy can indeed profoundly and permanently affect the firstborn child, and in turn the ‘guilty’ parents, who, in retrospect, handled the problem inappropriately. Image the serene, secure 12‐month‐old first baby son, sent away from home and parents to be cared for (expertly) by a stranger during his mother's second confinement; episodes of spurious labour add to the duration of the parting and when the child is collected to return home 4 weeks later he accepts, more or less, the father who collects him, but is deeply saddened and no longer his extroverted happy self. One has only to look at the face of a happy child to appreciate the enormity of the change. They arrive home; the mother greets him with great love, immediately rejected in a storm of tears as his pain is revealed, this being a matter not quickly resolved — this is not an imagined tale but an anecdote from the home of a member of your editorial committee! Of course when the mother goes to hospital the first child should preferably remain in his/her own home, preferably with people he/she knows (father, grandparents) — to be separated from both parents and home when too young to understand the events of the hour is to be avoided at almost any cost. This advice should be given to all expectant mothers during their second pregnancy. Many patients state that their first child's behaviour changes during their second pregnancy are due to changes in their own behaviour to the child, due to fatigue and / or loss of patience. We need more data on this subject, especially since most of what we hear is bad news, unless the first child is no longer a baby and anticipates with pleasure the arrival of a playmate. It is difficult to explain to a baby how things may change but we should try. Most mothers give much attention to anticipation of the first child's needs after the second is born, when she returns home. This paper indicates that there is room for improvement in the antenatal management of this situation and, in the editor's opinion, the care of the firstborn during the mother's absence from home at the time of her confinement. Summary: Mothers in the last trimester of the second pregnancy admit to being less active, more tired and moody than previously. Many were more anxious than usual. Their first child frequently showed behavioural changes. Those surveyed were between 11/2 and 4 years of age and showed more clinging, sleep disturbance and misbehaviour with tantrums than expected. It is presumed that the mother's pregnancy induces anxiety in her child with consequent behavioural changes. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - A medical surveillance program has been established for 482 persons who were potentially exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzo-p-dioxins, and dibenzofurans from an electrical transformer fire in a Binghamton, NY office building in 1981. Vital Record and Cancer Registry data, medical records, and mail questionnaires were used to assess mortality, symptomatology, cancer incidence, and reproductive events through 1984. The numbers of deaths, cancers, fetal deaths, and infants with low birth weight or congenital malformations were similar to those expected on the basis of age- and sex-specific rates for upstate New York and other comparison populations. Two suicides were observed compared with 0.31 expected, but the difference was not statistically significant. After adjustment for possible confounders, persons with the greatest degree of potential exposure were significantly more likely than those with less exposure to report unexplained weight loss (relative risk [RR] = 12.80), muscle pain (RR = 5.07), frequent coughing (RR = 4.14), skin color changes (RR = 3.49), and nervousness or sleep problems (RR = 3.19). The possibility of recall bias and the intervening effects of stress, however, weaken the conclusion that toxic chemicals caused the symptomatology. Exposure-related systemic disorders, e.g., chloracne or peripheral neuropathy, were not diagnosed by personal physicians; however, some persons refused to release their medical records because of ongoing litigation. The findings are consistent with those of our earlier assessment. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Fifty-seven infants exposed to phencyclidine (PCP) in utero were followed for the first year of life. Thirty-six (65% of the 55 for whom birth records were available manifested symptoms of neonatal narcotic withdrawal syndrome, including 16 (52% of those whose mothers denied opiate abuse during pregnancy. Temperament problems were noted in 47% of the babies and sleep problems in 14% The majority of infants grew normally, but a larger than expected number started out small and remained small. Testing using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at age one year revealed a mental development index (mean ± SD) of 94 ± 10 and a psychomotor development index of 98 ± 10. Attachment behavior was abnormal in 17% Most infants were cared for by their natural mother. Further studies are needed to determine later effects of in utero PCP exposure, as well as effects on the infants being raised by women who have used PCP. Phencyclidine toxicity needs to be considered when evaluating babies with signs of neonatal narcotic withdrawal syndrome. © 1989 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - In order to examine the course of normal postpartum adjustment compared to the symptomatology of postpartum depression, 25 postpartum women who met Research Diagnostic Criteria for either major or minor depression were compared to 24 non-depressed postpartum women. The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered to all subjects. Results suggest that sleep disturbances and loss of sexual interest are common concomitants of normal postpartum adjustment. A discriminant function analysis indicated that the cognitive-affective symptoms of loss of energy, guilt, difficulties in concentration, and loss of interest in usual activities discriminated between depressed and non-depressed women most efficiently. Finally, there was a lack of concordance between the BDI and the SADS interviews, which suggests that the BDI may not be an appropriate instrument for diagnosing depression in a postpartum sample. © 1989.

AB  - We propose a family of log‐linear models for ordinal data that contain parameters reflecting change patterns to compare treatments relative to change from baseline. Under the most general model, rates of change can depend not only upon the direction of change, but also upon the level of the baseline classification. We describe methods for selection of a parsimonious model and for tests of hypotheses concerning treatment differences. Interpretation of treatment differences in the follow‐up response profiles, within baseline strata, employs the concept of stochastic ordering. Data from two clinical trials illustrate the proposed procedure. Copyright © 1989 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In 1967, Sohmer and Feinmesser recorded four negative peaks from extracochlear surface electrodes and they stated that the later components may be due to repetitive firing of auditory nerve fibers or may be due to the discharge of neurons in brain stem auditory nuclei. In 1970, Jewett, Romano and Williston presented the first full description of the scalp responses, postulated to be generated by brainstem nuclei. Since then, the auditory brainstem response (ABR) technique has attracted attention because it satisfied two previously unattainable needs; 1) a means of quantitative measurement of changes in auditory function in newborn babies or uncooperativep atients, and 2) the detection of brainstem neurologicala bnormalities.Recording during wakefulness and in sleep or under drug intoxication has shown that ABRs are independent of the level of arousal or attention, and this feature is particularly useful for people unable to cooperate appropriately. Because of the close relationship to the anatomy of brainstem pathways, ABRs offer a neurophysiological index of neuronal function at the level of the brainstem. At present, these responses have become widely recognized as an important tool for the diagnosis of neurological diseases. One specific feature of the ABR is its dependence on maturation. The ABR appears at around 26 weeks of gestation and thereafter undergoes systematic changes in latency, amplitude and threshold. By using a supramaximal intensity of more than 60 dBHL, it is possible to evoke in all newborn babies with sufficient hearing ability,w aves I, III and V. The principal pathophysiological findings in neurologic diseases concern the absolute and interpeak latencies of each wave, the amplitude ratio (wave V/wave I), the response threshold, the response to changes in the rate of stimulation, and the elimination of specific components.The amplitude ratio for which there are sufficient data is wave V /wave I, which usually exceeds 1 in normal subjects. The younger the patient, the longer are all the component latencies, the smaller the amplitude ratios, and the larger the effect of changes in the rate of stimulation.Therefore, age specific norms must be determined. Besides absolute latencies, interwave latencies are clinicallys ignificant since they allow evaluation of the brainstem function even in the presence of a hearing disturbance.The application of the ABR technique to various auditory and neurological diseases was discussed.It is noteworthy that none of these abnormalities is specific for any disease, and normal ABRs do not guarantee that hearing is normal in the perceptual sense, because further transmission may be disturbed. M LPs may be useful in such a situation. Conversely,the absence of several brainstem components dose not necessarily mean structural damage to the brainstem neurons or hearing impairment. The diagnosis of an audiological or a neurological disorder must be made on the basis of the clinical status and other available examination. © 1989, The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

AB  - Monosodium glutamate (MSG) has been shown to alter several neuroendocrine functions in neonatally treated rats. To evaluate for possible alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, we injected rats during the neonatal period with MSG or saline (controls). An increase in basal plasma corticosterone levels associated with a blunted circadian variation was observed. Ether exposure produced a significant elevation in plasma corticosterone concentration in both groups of animals. However, while the increase in controls was 181.3% for male and 193.9% for female rats, in the MSG-treated rats it was only 60.7 and 31.6%, respectively. The intraperitoneal administration of high dexamethasone doses blocked corticosterone secretion in both groups. However, whereas the lowest dose (0.10 μg/kg) suppressed corticosterone secretion in control animals, it was ineffective in MSG-treated rats. The morphological study of adrenals revealed signs of a hyperfunctional state in MSG-treated rats. These data suggest that the central lesions produced by MSG treatment disrupt the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

AB  - This study examines the regulation of circulating GH-independent insulin-like growth factor binding protein, BP-28. Commencing at 22.00 h, BP-28 in 5 normal adults rose 11-fold to peak values of 120 ± 12 μg/l, remained elevated between 01.00 and 08.00 h, then fell rapidly following a meal. If meals were omitted, BP-28 remained at peak levels throughout the day. The fasting BP-28 level was higher in women (141 ± 22 μg/l, N = 5) than men (59 ± 14 μg/l, N = 7), and pregnancy caused a further 2-fold elevation. Oral glucose rapidly lowered BP-28 in diabetic and nondiabetic pregnant women, non-pregnant women, and men. In a heterogeneous group of 18 subjects, insulin (0.1 U/kg iv), with or without simultaneous administration of GnRH and TRH, elicited a 3- to 4-fold rise in BP-28, commencing 60 min after the nadir of plasma glucose, and independent of the response in GH, PRL, TSH, LH or cortisol. We conclude that BP-28 levels in adults are metabolically regulated, and postulate a role for this protein in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.

AB  - The outcome for three siblings of SIDS (SSIDS) infants was predicted, using as a risk model the sleep and respiratory characteristics of a SIDS victim studied extensively during the neonatal period. The SIDS infant had shown unstable state organization and deviant respiration patterns, including a deficit of brief apneic pauses. Like the SIDS infant, the SSIDS infants and a group of 16 normal infants were observed in the home for 7-hr periods when they were 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks old. Two of the infants showed normal sleep and respiratory characteristics, and they were predicted to develop without respiratory dysfunction. In contrast, the third infant showed a pattern of deviancies similar to the SIDS infant; and at 4 months, she had prolonged apneic episodes, requiring resuscitation on two occasions. The findings are consistent with the notion of subtle central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction in SIDS risk infants from the time of birth. © 1988 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - To investigate CO effects on brain oxygenation, graded carboxyhemoglobulinemia (HbCO) was produced in nine unanesthetized fetal sheep by infusing CO-laden erythrocytes in exchange for fetal blood. For the 1st h after this procedure, the mean fetal carboxyhemoglobin levels were 16.5 ± 0.4% [control (C) = 1.4 ± 0.4%] for mild HbCO, 22.7 ± 0.6% (C = 1.8 ± 0.4%) for moderate HbCO, and 27.8 ± 0.5% (C = 2.1 ± 0.7%) for severe HbCO. This induction of HbCO significantly reduced mean preductal arterial PO2 values to 4.3 Torr below control for mild HbCO, 4.6 Torr below control for moderate HbCO, and 5.5 Torr below control for severe HbCO. The respective arterial O2 contents were decreased by 17, 21, and 29%. Mean arterial pH was lowered only during severe HbCO, and arterial PCO2 values were unchanged. HbCO produced a fetal tachycardia. Mean arterial blood pressure was only increased during severe HbCO. The incidences of rapid eye movements and breathing activity were decreased by HbCO in a dose-dependent manner. When related to calculated brain tissue PO2, these decreases were similar to those measured during hypoxic hypoxia and anemia, suggesting that carboxyhemoglobin effects result solely from diminished oxygenation. It is concluded that 1) the peripheral arterial chemoreceptors in the fetus apparently have little effect on hypoxic inhibition of breathing and 2) the carboxyhemoglobin concentrations required to inhibit fetal breathing are greater than those likely to be encountered clinically.

AB  - Ten pairs of full-term and 8 pairs of preterm twins from combined vaginal and Cesarean section deliveries were evaluated on measures of neonatal temperament, developmental status, and integrity to determine if the Cesaren-delivered infant was compromised relative to its vaginally-delivered twin. There were no significant differences, within groups, between the vaginal and Cesarean section infants on measures of risk and developmental status. Analyses of variance of paired comparisons performed on the temperament measures indicated that, for the full-term group, there were no significant differences in ratings between vaginally and Cesarean-delivered infants. In contrast, preterm infants delivered by Cesarean section were more active during sleep than their vaginally-delivered cotwins. This finding, together with previous findings demonstrating a relation between this measure and temperament at 9, 18, and 24 months of age, suggested that the preterm Cesarean-delivered infant may be at risk in this area when compared with its twin. In the main, however, the results demonstrated that infants born by Cesarean section following vaginal delivery of their twins were not more compromised than their twin siblings.

AB  - We studied maternal plasma levels of oestriol (measured by radioimmunoassay) and total cortisol (measured by a protein binding method) in 11 women from 8 to 22 weeks gestation. Blood specimens (5 ml) were drawn over a 24-h period at 60 and 30 min intervals. The diurnal rhythm of cortisol with higher values in the morning than in the afternoon and evening was present at all gestational ages studied. Unconjugated plasma oestriol showed a similar circadian rhythm to maternal cortisol (r=0.576, P<0.01) in the 8th week. From the 9th to the 11th week oestriol values rose and there was no evidence of a circadian rhythm. In the 12th week plama oestriol again showed a circadian rhythm, with higher values at night (117.3±9.5 pg/ml) than during day-time (104±7.5 pg/ml, P<0.001). This pattern remained until the 22nd week, when plasma oestriol levels at night (3.78±0.49 ng/ml) were markedly higher than in the day-time (3.16±0.3 ng/ml, P<0.001). An inverse relation between oestriol and cortisol levels as shown in late human pregnancy could not be demonstrated for the early stages we studied. The interval between rising cortisol and faling oestriol levels decreased from 6 h in the 12th week to 3.5 h in the 22nd week of gestation. This suggests an increasing sensitivity of the fetal hypothalamus to the feedback effect of maternal cortisol. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - During development, the circadian rhythms of rodents become entrained to rhythmicity of the mother. Rhythms in behavior and in neuroendocrine function are regulated by a circadian pacemaker thought to be located within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Evidence indicates that this pacemaker begins to function and to be entrained by maternal rhythms before birth. Although the maternal rhythms which mediate prenatal entrainment of the fetal circadian pacemaker have not been identified, it is likely that they are regulated by the maternal SCN. The role of the maternal SCN in entrainment of the offspring was examined in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) by measuring the activity/rest rhythms of pups. Using the synchrony among the rhythms of pups within a litter as an indication that the pups had been entrained, the effect on entrainment of ablating the maternal SCN was determined. Lesions of the maternal SCN which were performed early in gestation (day 7) and which destroyed at least 75% of the SCN were found to disrupt the normal within litter synchrony among pups, indicating interference with the normal mechanism of entrainment. The effect of lesions on day 7 of gestation could mean that the maternal SCN is important for entrainment of the pups before birth, after birth, or during both of these times. To determine if the maternal SCN is specifically important for prenatal entrainment, lesions were performed two days before birth on day 14 of gestation. Lesions of the maternal SCN on day 14 were not as disruptive as were lesions on day 7. This suggests that the maternal SCN is important between days 7 and 14 of gestation and that the synchrony normally observed at weaning is already established, in part, on or before day 14 of gestation. This further suggests that an entrainable circadian pacemaker is present in the fetus only two weeks after fertilization. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - We have measured plasma melatonin (MT) concentrations in the pregnant ewe and fetal sheep during 24-h periods between 114 and 142 days gestation. There was a clear diurnal rhythm in the plasma MT concentrations in both the ewe and fetus from 114 days gestation. Blood samples were also collected from the pregnant ewe and fetus during the day every 2â€ 3 days from 112 days gestation to term. There was no gestational age trend in maternal or fetal day time plasma MT concentrations during late pregnancy. To establish whether there was transplacental transfer of MT, pregnant ewes were injected with [3H]MT, and total radioactivity (disintegrations per min) was measured in maternal and fetal arterial plasma and in amniotic fluid collected before and for 1 h after the [3H]MT injection. Two minutes after [3H]MT injection, radioactivity was detected in both maternal and fetal sheep plasma. Extraction of fetal plasma with chloroform indicated that [3H]MT accounted for 48.0±7.2 (SE) % of total radioactivity at 2 min after the injection. In one pregnant ewe infused with unlabeled MT (0.3 µg/ml saline-min for 20 min) maternal and fetal plasma MT concentrations increased within 6 min after the start of the MT infusion. We conclude that there is a diurnal rhythm in the plasma concentrations of MT in the fetal lamb and pregnant ewe between 114 and 142 days gestation, and that MT crosses the ovine placenta from the maternal to the fetal circulation. Therefore, the MT present in the fetal sheep circulation may be solely of maternal origin or it may be derived from both fetal and maternal sources. © 1988 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The role of maternal circadian rhythms in the development of the fetal circadian system was investigated in the rat. Pregnant females were subjected to procedures known to disrupt circadian function, ablation of the maternal suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) or housing in constant illumination, on gestational day 10. Circadian function was assessed in fetuses at gestational day 22 by analysis of glucose utilization in hypothalamic slices in vitro using the 2-deoxyglucose method. Fetuses from control females exhibit a robust rhythm in glucose utilization in the SCN. In contrast, the SCN of fetuses from females with SCN lesions, or housed in constant illumination, show no significant day-night difference in glucose utilization. Analysis of individual brains indicates, however, that this apparent disruption in the development of circadian rhythmicity in metabolism in the fetal SCN is due to a desynchronization of individual fetuses resulting from the loss of maternal entraining influences. Thus, the fetal SCN is capable of developing a circadian rhythm in glucose utilization independent of the maternal circadian system. © 1988.

AB  - Measurement of prolactin (PRL) at 120‐140 days gestation in chronically‐cannulated fetal lambs and their mothers during hormonally‐extended breeding seasons shows that photoperiod is a major determinant of PRL secretion in the fetal lamb as well as in its mother. About 80% of the variance between fetuses in plasma PRL concentration is associated with variation in ambient photoperiod. The magnitude of this effect far exceeds the range of previously reported diurnal or ontogenetic changes in PRL in the fetal lamb. © 1988 The Physiological Society

AB  - On 25-30-day rabbit foetuses, in chronic experiments using constant synchronous recording of the motor activity and heart rate, studies have been made of temporal organization of the activity-rest cycle. Already in 25-day foetus, three functional conditions may be distinguished: active, intermediate and resting ones, the duration of the latter increasing to the end of gestation up to 8-10 min, whereas the duration of the intermediate phase decreases, reaching its minimum to the 30th day if not being completely reduced. Cyclic pattern of active and resting phases is observed in 28-day foetuses; to the 29th-30th day, these phases from a unique activity-rest cycle, its duration reaching 20-30 min to the end of intrauterine period. It is suggested that the resting phase in foetal rabbits serves as a basis for the development of polyphasic sleep in adult animals.

AB  - Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) was analysed in 25 pregnant women with trisomy 21 foetuses whose chromosomal aberration was recognized by cytogenetic study after amniocentesis. Enzyme investigation was performed at 20-22 weeks of gestation using cytochemical and biochemical techniques. Twenty-nine women at the same stage of normal pregnancies were selected as controls. In parallel, each mother was karyotyped. Ten subjects from each series underwent biochemical and immunological investigation: measurement of enzyme levels, thermostability study and immunological tests with alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme antibodies. NAP from pregnant women with trisomy 21 foetuses was characterized by: (1) a lower rate of enzyme activity, (2) a large amount of heat-stable enzyme (T=56°C for biochemical assays, T=85°C for cytochemical tests), and (3) a marked loss of liver antigenicity. These findings suggest the presence in trisomy 21 pregnancies of a non-specific alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme which appears as an "enzyme marker" in maternal circulating neutrophils. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Iodinated melatonin was used to study melatonin sites of action in brain. Iodomelatonin mimicked the effects of melatonin on reproductive development in Djungarian hamster fetuses. 125I-melatonin injected into the dam was recovered from fetal brain. In vitro autoradiographic studies revealed a remarkably discrete distribution of competitive 125I-melatonin-binding sites in the fetal brain, with binding in median eminence/arcuate nucleus area &gt; suprachiasmatic nucleus &gt; pineal gland ≫ anterior pituitary gland ≫ preoptic area. 125I-melatonin promises to be a useful tool for understanding the sites and mechanism of action of melatonin. © 1988.

AB  - The influence of pregnancy on circadian variations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and aldosterone was studied. In those women with normal pregnancies, the mean 24-hour values of atrial natriuretic peptide and aldosterone increased, compared with the levels in normal nonpregnant subjects. In cases of severe preeclampsia, levels of atrial natriuretic peptide were significantly higher than in the other subjects, but aldosterone levels decreased to nearly those seen in the nonpregnant subjects. Atrial natriuretic peptide did not establish a rhythm in normal nonpregnant and pregnant subjects, but in the studies of aldosterone levels, a clear circadian rhythm was evident. In severe cases of preeclampsia, atrial natriuretic peptide established a circadian rhythm similar to that of blood pressure, and the circadian rhythm of aldosterone disappeared. The main characteristic of the rhythm in atrial natriuretic peptide and blood pressure in women showing preeclamptic signs is that the acrophase occurred at midnight. This evidence suggests that in women with symptoms of preeclampsia the load to the atria increases at midnight. © 1988.

AB  - These studies describe diurnal rhythm changes in female rats during gestation and lactation. In Experiment I, we measured the diurnal temperature rhythm (DTR) of 20 females through gestation, lactation and the post-lactational period and found that rhythm amplitude decreased during gestation and increased during lactation. Phase changes were also common features of the DTR during these states. In Experiment II, we measured drinking rhythms in 12 females during lactation and post-lactation and found phase and amplitude changes that were similar to the DTR changes seen in Experiment I. In Experiment III, we correlated the behavior of lactating females with their DTR and found that there was a consistent internal organization between behavior and Tb regardless of the degree of change in the DTR during the postpartum period. Females showing large phase changes in their DTR patterns were distinguishable from those showing smaller phase changes, however, on the basis of the absolute temporal organization of their behavior during lactation. All phase and amplitude changes disappeared immediately after pups were removed from the cage. © 1988.

AB  - A circadian pacemaker, thought to be within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, begins to function before birth in rodents. Prenatal entrainment of the pacemaker appears to be mediated by signals regulated by the maternal SCN; ablation of the mother's SCN during gestation disrupts the normal phase of the pups' rhythms. The present paper presents an experimental approach for identifying candidate entraining signals and for testing when they are effective during development. The candidate signal examined in these experiments was the pineal gland hormone, melatonin. Female golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) received SCN lesions on day 7 of gestation. During the last week of gestation, they were given two daily subcutaneous injections of oil 12 h apart. One of the injections each day contained melatonin (10, 50, or 100 μg). The phases of the pups' activity rhythms were measured at weaning and were found to be related to the timing of the daily injection that contained melatonin, demonstrating that the melatonin directly or indirectly set the phase of the pups' rhythms. Injections given over 4 days of gestation were found to be as effective as injections given over 7 days. Although a physiological role for melatonin as an entraining signal has not been demonstrated, the results show that exogenous, prenatal treatment can predictably set the phase of the offsprings' circadian rhythms.

AB  - Seasonality of the reproductive cycle in sheep is a general phenomenon for mid-latitude breeds. The proximal part (breeding season) and also partially distal part (end of gestation and beginning of lactation) of this cycle is controlled by photoperiod, whatever the form of light regimens. Data are presented which indicate that male and female do not necessarily have the same photoperiodic sensitivity. Gonadal stimulation inthe ram starts 1'5-2 months earlier than in the ewe under annual variations. Photoperiod controls the reproductive cycle by the intermediary of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis. There are both a steroidindependent and a steroid-dependent effect of light, depending on both decreasing and increasing daylength in mid-latitudes. Data are also presented which support Bunning's hypothesis on photoperiodic time measurement in mammals. Sheep measure photoperiodic time by using a circadian rhythm of photosensitivity. Daylength is not measured by the total duration of exposure to light but by the illumination of two special set points during the day, one of them entraining the circadian rhythm of photosensitivity and the other inducing or not inducing a physiological response if it is coincident, or not coincident, with photoinducible phase of that rhythm. A photoinducible phase has been found for prolactin secretion, and perhaps also for LH secretion. Melatonin secretion is used by sheep for measuring daylength. However, that secretion disappears during two set points during the day, thus raising the possibility of using alternatively melatonin and light pulse for controlling the reproductive cycle in sheep. © 1988 ASEG.

AB  - Twenty-four hour patterns of lutropin and progesterone pulsatile secretion base line were studied in six postpartum dairy cows. The base line of lutropin showed three peaks within 24 hours. The base line of progesterone showed two peaks which coincided in the time with the nadirs of lutropin base line. These peaks show up clearly irrespective of the stage of puerperium.

AB  - During pregnancy, the liver may produce less urea,but more ammonia. The purpose of this study was to compare pregnant (19th gestational day) and nonpregnant Sprague-Dawley rats fed a 20% casein diet ad libitun with respect to the concentrations of plasma ammonia in blood from three blood vessels - portal vein, hepatic vein, and abdominal aorta. The concentrations of ammonia at two times, 12 h apart, were determined. The only significant difference was that the concentration of plasma ammonia in blood from the hepatic vein was greater in pregnant rats than in nonpregnant rats in the dark period of the lighting cycle. This diversion of ammonia from the urea cycle may contribute to the conservation of nitrogen during pregnancy. © 1988 Pergamon Press plc.

AB  - Both healthy third-trimester pregnant women and a group of women with gestational diabetes failed to show a difference in glucose clearance rates when given an intravenous glucose bolus at 8 Ann compared with 4 PM. The plasma insulin response in the healthy pregnant women was greater at 8 Ann. In the diabetic group, the peak insulin response was greater at 4 PM, but it was more prolonged after the 8 AM tests. These alterations in plasma insulin response were especially striking in the subgroup of obese women with gestational diabetes, who demonstrated metabolic differences compared with their nonobese counterparts. © 1988, C.

AB  - With technological progress, blood pressure monitoring has become a procedure largely applied in medical practice but not adequately systematized under a biostatistical viewpoint. This paper shows the complexity and importance of the biomathematical approach and its clinical implications in preeclamptic pregnancy. Data series were analyzed by means of noninferential and inferential procedures of biostatistics. A progressive gain of information is obtained, the inferential procedures showing an analytical resolution able to discriminate fetal distress in preeclamptic pregnancy.

AB  - The aims of our study were: (1) to answer the question “Do sleep states exist in normal premature infants;” (2) to anaylze the development of sleep cycle and sleep state characteristics in premature and full‐term newborns. Polygraph recordings were done on 38 normal, appropriate for gestational age newborns, born at 30 to 41 weeks (w) of gestation. All infants fell asleep in active sleep (AS). Postwaking AS was significantly shorter than the next AS. Mean sleep cycle duration increased from approximately 46 min at 31–34 w of conceptional age (CA) to 70 min. at 35–36 w CA. In all infants we observed stable, >5 min AS and quiet sleep (QS) periods, as defined by EEG and REM criteria. Indeterminate sleep was about 30% of the total sleep cycle at 31–34 w; it decreased to 12% at 35–36 w. Both duration and percentage of AS and QS significantly increased at 35–36 w and remained stable up to 39–41 w CA. Values of QS were significantly reduced when defined by additional criteria (respiratory rate, tonic chin EMG or motility). Concordance of QS criteria was not significantly better in older versus younger groups of infants. At all ages, AS values were insensitive to changes in the criteria chosen to define them. The contrast, starting from 31–34 w CA, between AS and QS as defined by EEG and REM criteria could account for state differences in the control of many physiological variables in prematures.

AB  - The development of fetal behaviour is reviewed. Fetal cutaneous and muscle sensory receptors are developed by the time movements are first seen. Human infants certainly respond to painful stimuli at 28 weeks. There is no clear evidence that prenatal 'stress', e.g., maternal exposure to random noise and bright lights, impairs fetal development in the rat, on the contrary. Fetal diurnal rhythms appear in man and sheep before the development of sleep states; they are dependent on maternal corticosteroids, but the fetal mechanism is uncertain. With the development of sleep states (in late gestation in man and sheep, postnatally in the rat), the complex central control of behaviour is gradually established, but wakefulness is still of low incidence. The location of the sleep cycle generator is uncertain; the results of experimental lesions of the brainstem in fetal lambs appear incompatible with studies in adult rats and cats.

AB  - We evaluated to what extent the tyrosine (TYR) and tryptophan (TRP) transport by the red cells was stable in normal subjects during divers clinical conditions. Twenty-two normal subjects were studied. The values of TYR and TRP transport were found to be individually determined, showed no circadian oscillations and no changes during the menstrual cycle, but varied somewhat more during the postpartum period. A few normal subjects had low TYR and TRP transport values, as observed in patients with affective disorders.

AB  - A dramatic change in growth hormone secretion was demonstrated during the 3rd trimester of human pregnancy, when compared with the non‐pregnant state. The pulsatile pattern, with intermittent high peaks, and low or undetectable levels between peaks, characteristic of normal men and non‐pregnant women, was completely abolished. All the 10 pregnant women investigated had the same stable basal circulating growth hormone concentration. Values were in the range 6–10 mu/l and there was no evidence of pulsatile activity. Previously, in animal experiments, a continuous secretion of growth hormone has been shown to ‘feminize’ hepatic steroid metabolism, hepatic prolactin receptors, hepatic sulphatase activity and to stimulate pregnancy protein synthesis. The same biological principle could be valid also during human pregnancy and be related to maternal metabolic adjustment. 1988 Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand

AB  - Female musk shrews (Suncus murinus) were tested daily to examine patterns of sexual receptivity. When only mounting was used as a criterion (to avoid pregnancy), nonpregnant females remained sexually receptive to males every day for 14 consecutive days. When insemination was allowed, most females continued to copulate for the first 5 days of pregnancy. Receptivity declined markedly around Day 10 of gestation, but a few females were receptive even into late pregnancy. Lactating females copulated with males 5 and 10 days after parturition. In general, unlike most mammals studied in the laboratory, the nonpregnant female musk shrew has no behavioral estrous cycle. Musk shrews are ready to mate anytime except in mid to late pregnancy, and even then occasionally mating is found. © 1988.

AB  - Average daily core body temperature and behavioural patterns of pregnant mares were studied, in search of definitive signs of parturition within 24 h of the event. Nineteen pony mares were sampled twice daily for core body temperature. A significant temperature drop, averaging 0.1°C (0.2°F) was observed during the day prior to parturition. Between 18.00 h and 06.00 h, during the two weeks before parturition, Thoroughbred and Standardbred mares (n=52) spent an average 66.8 per cent of their time standing, 27.0 per cent eating, 4.9 per cent lying in sternal recumbency, 1.0 per cent lying in lateral recumbency, and 0.3 per cent walking. On the night before parturition, mares spent significantly less time lying in sternal recumbency than on previous nights and on the night of parturition all behaviour patterns except eating were significantly different from the nights of the two weeks before parturition. There was an increase in walking (5.3 per cent), lying in sternal recumbency (8 per cent) and lying in lateral recumbency (5.3 per cent) whereas standing (53.3 per cent) was decreased. In 58 observed pregnancies, 54 mares (97 per cent) foaled in a recumbent position and 50 mares (86 per cent) foaled between 18.00 h and 06.00 h. © 1988 EVJ Ltd

AB  - Continuous 24-hour observations of fetal gross body movements were performed in 20 women between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation by means of real-time ultrasound examination. At 24 to 26 weeks, fetuses moved 13.1% ± 0.3% of the time, which was not significantly different from the incidence of 12.4% ± 0.8% at 26 to 28 weeks' gestation. An examination of the number of movements per hour demonstrated that fetuses at 24 to 26 weeks' gestation moved on the average 53.4 ± 1.6 times/hr, which was significantly different from 26 to 28 weeks' gestation when fetuses made 46.2 ± 1.4 movements/hr. When examined on an hourly basis, fetuses in both age groups demonstrated a significant increase in the number of movements overnight from 2300 to 0800 hours. Intermovement intervals were also examined. Ninety-nine percent of intervals <6 minutes in both age groups contained movement. The longest observed quiescent interval was 24 minutes in both age groups. These data suggest that the incidence of fetal body movements is different than that observed in fetuses during the last 10 weeks of gestation. Fetuses at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation exhibit a diurnal pattern of fetal movement and move more frequently than do older fetuses. However, these movements are of a sporadic nature and relatively short duration. Thus these fetuses do not appear to have well-defined periods of rest and activity. © 1988.

AB  - To explore the diurnal variation and the relationship between serum hCG levels and thyroid function during pregnancy, 26 women with an uncomplicated early pregnancy were studied before and after interruption of pregnancy. The high serum hCG levels in early pregnancy were accompanied by an increase in serum thyroid hormone and a decrease in serum TSH levels. Nevertheless, serum TSH exhibited diurnal variation similar to that in nonpregnant women. The nocturnal surge of TSH exceeded the daytime nadir by 112% and was distinctly different from the normal serum cortisol variation. The diurnal serum T4 and hCG variations were similar to the variation in serum protein concentrations. After pregnancy interruption, serum hCG levels decreased by 95% within 10 days, and TSH levels rose concomitantly from 0.80 to 1.48 mlU/L (P &lt; 0.001). In individual women serum hCG correlated negatively with TSH (r = 0.322; P = 0.005) and positively with free T3 (r = 0.388; P &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that hCG has thyrotropic activity, which, through rises in thyroid hormone levels, suppresses TSH secretion. In this regard, 27, 000-128, 000 IU hCG correspond to 1 mlU TSH. Pregnancy-induced changes in thyroid function, however, do not affect the circadian TSH rhythm. © 1988 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - To investigate the pattern of change in endogenous overnight creatinine clearance during the third trimester, 12 healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies were examined three times a week. Urine was collected overnight from 22.00 to 08.00 hours and analysed for creatinine. Serum was sampled in the morning and analysed for creatinine, β2‐microglobulin, progesterone and estradiol. The general trend of creatinine clearance was parabolic with a declining level during the last month before term. A sinusoid pattern with minimum values around the time when the women would have had menstruation had they not become pregnant was superimposed on the parabolic trend. A mathematical model (parabolas overlaid with a cosine curve) was constructed and fitted to the data. The cyclical pattern was significant. Serum creatinine showed a pattern with increasing values during the last 4–6 weeks before term and cyclical changes which were also significant. In the individual case the monthly and preterm clearance decrement sometimes was over 50%. Monthly and preterm decreases in creatinine clearance may be quite normal and serial measurements of creatinine clearance are therefore necessary to determine if declining values indicate pathological falls in the glomerular filtration rate. 1988 Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine

On gestational day 10, pregnant animals received a single intraperitoneal injection of ethanol with the following dose levels: 1.0, 2.5 or 4.0 g/kg at one of four circadian phases (0700, 1300, 1900 or 0100 hr). 48 hrs after injection the embryonic weight and length, protein and DNA content and placental weight and protein were determined. Ethanol-related intrauterine growth retardation were shown to be dose- and circadian phase-dependent, the greatest susceptibility being seen during the dark phase. The variations observed are discussed with regard to changes in drug metabolism and tissue sensitivity. © 1988 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - It is well known that prenatal exposure to ethanol may adversely affect fetal growth and development. To study the circadian-phase influence on intrauterine growth retardation timed-pregnant mice were given a single intraperitoneal injection of ethyl alcohol at dose levels of 2.5 g/kg or 4.0 g/kg at one of four selected time points (07.00, 13.00, 19.00 or 01.00 hr) on gestational day 10. Control groups received an equivalent volume of physiologic saline. The fetal response was observed at days 12, 14, 16 or 18. Growth retardation was manifested by a decrease in fetal weight, length, and an increase in total body water content which all correlated well with corresponding changes in the placenta and showed marked differences according to the circadian stage of administration. The retardation was significantly greater in those fetuses whose dams received ethanol during the dark hours. The study suggests that the circadian phase of ethanol exposure as well as the dose level and the gestational stage strongly influence the severity of prenatal growth retardation.

AB  - The authors studied 740 consecutive in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles over a 3-year period to compare the results of cycles in which and endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) surge occurred with cycles in which human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was administered for induction of follicular maturation. Clomiphene citrate (100 to 150 mg daily on cycle days 5 to 9) and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG; 75 to 150 IU daily from cycle day 6) were used for stimulation. Embryo transfer (ET) occurred in 164 (81.2%) of the LH surge cycles and 452 (84%; P = not significant [NS]) of the hCG cycles. The first urinary rise in LH was detected in the 6 or 9 A.M. collections in 78 (47.3%) of the LH surge cycles, a greater number (P < 0.01) than expected if LH surge onset was random. A total of 107 pregnancies was achieved, for an overall pregnancy rate of 17.4% per ET. The pregnancy rate in the hCG-stimulated cycles was 13.9% per ET (63/452) and, in spontaneous LH surge cycles, was 28.8% (44/166; P < 0.001). The spontaneous abortion rate was 9.1% in LH surge cycles, compared with 25.4% in hCG-triggered cycles (P < 0.001). The result was a 2.4 times increase in live births for LH surge cycles compared with cycles in which hCG was administered. In this program, occurrence of an LH surge is a favorable event, associated with higher pregnancy and live birth rates than hCG-stimulated cycles, and usually occurring in the early morning, allowing oocyte retrieval during normal working hours.

AB  - Rats exposed to 60-Hz electric fields of either 10, 65, or 130 kV/m from conception to 23 days of age exhibited reduced peak nighttime pineal melatonin contents compared to unexposed controls. As a group, the exposed rats also exhibited a phase delay, estimated at approximately 1.4 hours, in the occurrence of the nocturnal melatonin peak. No clear dose-response relationship was noticed over the range of electric field strengths used as treatments in these experiments. These are the first studies concerned with the effects of electric field exposure on the pineal melatonin rhythm in immature rats. The findings are generally consistent with those obtained using adult rats, where electric field exposure has been shown to abolish the nighttime rhythm in pineal melatonin concentrations. © 1988.

AB  - Four lactating sheep were used to study diurnal variations in the concentration, arteriovenous concentration difference, extraction ratio, and uptake of 3-hydroxybutyrate and plasma free fatty acids by the hind limb of the lactating sheep. The arterial and venous concentrations of 3-hydroxybutyrate showed significant diurnal variations, which appear to be related to the feeding regimen, since values declined after feed withdrawal and rose after refeeding. Throughout the experimental period uptake of 3-hydroxybutyrate by the hind-limb was consistent and none of the small variations in arteriovenous difference, extraction ratio, or uptake of 3-hydroxybutyrate by the hind limb was statistically significant. By contrast, free fatty acid concentrations in arterial blood rose steadily after feed withdrawal. Except at feeding time, there was an output of free fatty acid by the hind limb. © 1988, American Dairy Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Longitudinal changes in nutrient levels of human milk have been observed with the progression of lactation, but less is known about changes at different feedings during a 24-h period. In this study, calcium, magnesium, and zinc levels were examined in milk obtained from 49 women at every breast feeding during one 24-h period each month for the first 6 months of lactation. Magnesium and zinc concentrations showed significant diurnal variation at each stage of lactation examined. whereas calcium levels were relatively constant. Maximum variations of 7.5, 17, and 48% were observed within a 24-h period in mean levels of calcium, magnesium, and zinc, respectively. Irrespective of variability, zinc and magnesium concentrations in a single milk sample obtained between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. were highly correlated with the mean value of samples collected at each feeding during a 24-h period. © 1988 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.

AB  - To investigate the neuroendocrine changes that regulate initiation of normal menstrual function after parturition, serum LH, FSH, and PRL concentrations were determined at 20-min intervals for 12-24 h in eight nonlactating postpartum women on a weekly basis between postpartum days 10–26. Sleep was monitored by EEC On postpartum day 10, serum LH concentrations were similar to early follicular phase levels in normal cycling women, while FSH concentrations were lower than early follicular phase levels. Mean LH pulse frequency during each postpartum interval was 3.6 ± 0.6 (±SE), 4.4 ± 0.6, and 4.1 ± 0.8 pulses/12 h on postpartum days 10-11, 17–21, and 24-26, respectively. Because mean serum LH levels and LH pulse frequency did not change significantly between postpartum days 10 and 26, the results from the two or three studies in each woman were combined for the purpose of comparing LH pulse characteristics during the waking and sleeping periods. During the waking hours, mean LH pulse frequency (6.1 ± 0.5 pulses/12 h) was significantly greater than during sleep (4.1 ± 0.4 pulses/12 h; P < 0.02). The amplitude of the serum immunoreactive LH pulses (P < 0.05) and bioactive LH levels (P < 0.05) were significantly higher during sleep than during the waking period, with five of the eight women having higher sleep-associated immunoreactive LH and bioactive LH levels between postpartum days 17-26. These changes were associated with an increase in the bioactive to immunoactive LH ratio from 3.3 ± 0.4 (awake) to 4.5 ± 0.5 (sleep; P < 0.05). Although serum PRL levels remained elevated during the puerperium, the diurnal pattern of PRL secretion was conserved. With each successive week postpartum, serum PRL concentrations declined. These results suggest that the increment in LH secretion (and, by inference, increased GnRH secretion) during sleep is a feature of postpartum pituitary-ovarian reactivation. Although the mechanism(s) responsible for the increase in GnRH secretion is not known, this hormonal pattern is analogous to that during early puberty and during recovery from anorexia nervosa and hypothalamic amenorrhea. Taken together, these findings provide evidence to support the concept of a centralized preprogramed scheme for pituitary-gonadal reactivation. © 1988 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - FSH secretion from the pituitary is now generally believed to be controlled only by LH-RH. However, since 1971 I have been publishing lines of evidence suggesting that FSH is controlled by both LH-RH and FSH-RH distinct from LH-RH. Recent accumulated reports suggest that lots of data cannot be explained by the one-RH theory. The one-RH theory means that both LH and FSH are regulated by a sole releasing factor, LH-RH. In 1985 we succeeded in purification of porcine and bovine follicular inhibin for the first time in the world. Its molecular weight was 32,000, which consisted of alpha-subunit (mw 20,000) and beta-subunit (mw 13,000). The site of production of inhibin was confirmed to be granulosa cell by immuno-histochemical technique and to be corpus luteum by RIA. Secretion of inhibin was stimulated by FSH, insulin, platelet extract, dibutyryl c-AMP, cholera toxin, forskolin, and inhibited by cortisol. Testosterone augmented FSH action. In the pituitary cells, inhibin inhibited synthesis of FSH, so cycloheximide could mimicked inhibin action in vitro. Inhibin did not inhibit LH release from the pituitary, but LH release stimulated by LH-RH was also inhibited by inhibin in vitro. Using anti-porcine inhibin antibody and anti bovine inhibin antibody prepared by us, we could measure blood inhibin levels during rat, pig, cow and goat sexual cycles, human menstrual cycle, human pregnancy, and clomiphene-HMG stimulated menstrual cycle. We found maximum blood inhibin levels in the luteal phase and during pregnancy. These high levels of inhibin were demonstrated to be derived from the corpus luteum, pregnant corpus luteum and placenta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Hormone assays are very important in obstetrics and gynecology. Today, I want to talk about how to measure hormones and how to evaluate the data obtained for therapeutic purposes. In humans, there are two mechanisms of control, neural control and endocrine control. Generally speaking, the neural system controls organs directly via various neurotransmitters, while the endocrine system controls organs by hormones transported in the blood. In fact, recent progress in hormone research has shown that this concept should be modified, because some hormones act as neurotransmitters or regulate other cells or even endocrine cells themselves in the same organ. But I shall not go into this. Today's lecture is focused on hormones that are closely related to clinical obstetrics and gynecology. The hormones that are important are those in females, reproduction, and pregnancy, and tumors. First, and most important, is that patients acquire femininity in the physiological and psychological sense by hormones. The hormones closely related to this are estrogens and pituitary hormones. For reproduction, cyclic hormonal change is important. In the reproductive period, women have menstruation and ovulation along with cyclic changes of ovarian and pituitary hormones. After conception, various kinds of hormones, including hCG, HPL and estriol, are secreted from the feto-placental system. These hormones are used clinically as a markers of placental function. Hormones also have important roles in oncology. hCG is an excellent marker of trophoblastic diseases. Endometrial cancer is expected respond to large doses of progestins if they have progesterone receptors. There are three types of hormone assays, biological assays, immunological assays and chemical assays.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Using a specific radioimmunoassay the concentrations of β-endorphin, β-lipotropin and corticotropin in maternal plasma were studied during pregnancy and in the early puerperium. Compared with the values in nonpregnant women, levels of β-endorphin and β-lipotropin were slightly lower in the first and second trimesters; corticotropin showed no difference in the first trimester. The concentrations of all these peptides increased towards term, most markedly in the case of corticotropin. The diurnal variation was studied near term and again in the early puerperium. β-Endorphin and corticotropin showed a parallel diurnal variation. The values in the morning and during the day were slightly higher during pregnancy than in the puerperium, whereas the values at midnight were similar. After vaginal delivery, a rapid and parallel decrease in the plasma levels of β-endorphin, β-lipotropin and corticotropin was found. In elective cesarean section, the values were highest 30 min after delivery, reflecting surgical stress, and then the decrease was similar to that after vaginal delivery. Thus parallel changes in the plasma levels of β-endorphin, β-lipotropin and corticotropin during pregnancy and in the early puerperium were found, which can be explained by their origin from a common precursor peptide, pro-opiomelanocortin. The rise in the plasma levels of corticotropin and endorphins near term and the exaggerated diurnal variation is probably a reflection of a maternal adaptation to stress. © 1988 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

AB  - Diurnal birth patterns in the City of Guangzhou, China and the City of Calgary in Canada were compared. Chinese data were abstracted from the labor room log book of one large general hospital located in the Hai Zhu district of Guangzhou. Calgary birth data were abstracted from birth notification forms submitted to Calgary Health Services. Information included day of birth, time of delivery, type of delivery and parity. Calgary births are concentrated on Tuesdays to Fridays whereas in Guangzhou weekly patterns varied tremendously according to whether it was assisted or unassisted. Calgary births are below average at night and during evening shift. The time of birth in Guangzhou varied substantially with above average rates for non-assisted births noted at 0800-2400 h, and above average rates for assisted births noted at 0800-1700 h. Differences in hour of birth appeared to be related to obstetric intervention practices. Knowledge of birthing patterns are useful for effective hospital management. © 1988.

AB  - The mechanisms of the embryotoxic effects of the anticon vulsant drug, phenytoin (PHT), are unknown. Glucocorticoids and PHT demonstrate similar embryopathic effects and strain sensitivity in that A J mice are very sensitive to the embryopathic effects of synthetic glucocorticoids and PHT while C67BL 6 (B6) mice are comparatively resistant to both. It is possible that teratogenic consequences of PHT are not a result of drug interaction at the target site but are mediated indirectly by glucocorticoids. In this study, PHT was administered by intraperitoneal injection at 25 (a nonteratogenic dose) or 75 mg/kg body weight (a teratogenic dose) to pregnant A J mice on Day 10 of gestation. Mice of the B6 strain received the drug at 75 mg/kg on Day 10. Control mice received vehicle (pH 11.0 distilled water). Dams were killed at various times after the injection; plasma samples were obtained, and corticosterone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. In control animals, maternal plasma corticosterone levels were elevated soon after dosing but gradually declined, except for an apparent circadian rhythm effect seen in samples obtained in the afternoon. Administration of a nonteratogenic dose of PHT to A J mice caused a temporary increase in plasma corticosterone levels which decreased to the control level between 6 and 24 hr following dosing. Treatment with a teratogenic dose in A J mice led to plasma levels that remained elevated for the entire 48-hr period examined in this study. In B6 mice, treatment with 75 mg/kg increased plasma corticosterone levels for 24 hr, after which they declined to the control value by 30 hr. The adrenal corticosteroid response of A J mice to PHT appeared to be much more sensitive than that of B6 mice, and there appeared to be a relationship between plasma levels of PHT and corticosterone. The lengthy increase in plasma corticosterone during organogenesis may be a factor in the increased incidence of cleft lip and palate seen after administration of PHT to A J mice. © 1988.

AB  - The present study investigates the significance of a circadian changing sensitivity on the feed back action of cortisol for the foetal hypothalamic hypophyseal system. 9 patients with uncomplicated courses of pregnancy in the 37th to 40th week volunteered in this study. All of them delivered healthy babies at term. 5 patients received a continuous infusion of 0.25 mg ACTH1-24 (Synacthen®) in the morning from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (group I). To 4 patients an analogous ACTH infusion was applied in the evening from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. (group II). Blood specimens (5 ml) were drawn from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. in group I and from 5 p.m. to 3 a.m. in group II in 60 and 30 minutes intervals, respectively. Free plasma oestriol was measured by radioimmunoassay, total plasma cortisol by the protein binding method. In group I cortisol increased from 294.3±52.9 ng/ml to 774.5±170 ng/ml, whereas oestriol decreased from 13.1±6.1 ng/ml to 6.8±2.1 ng/ml (p&lt;0.001). In group II cortisol rose from 267.5±76.2 ng/ml to 1010±284 ng/ml, whereas oestriol levels were suppressed from 21.7±10.5 ng/ml to 10.8±3.2 ng/ml (p&lt;0.001). Two hours after starting ACTH infusion rising cortisol and falling oestriol concentrations were negatively correlated (r = -0.9657, p&lt;0.001 in the morning; r = -0.9119, p&lt;0.001 in the evening). Plasma oestriol levels were in the evening suppressed on an average of 10.9 ng/ml and exceeded the oestriol decrease in the morning (6.3 ng/ml). According to these results the foetal hypothalamic-hypophyseal system exhibits in the evening a greater sensitivity for the feed back action of cortisol than in the morning.

AB  - 1. Lactating grazing ewes, fistulated at the rumen and abomasum were either not supplemented or offered, individually, 600 g/d of either pelleted, molassed sugar-beet pulp (‘energy’ supplement) or a pelleted 1:1 (w/w) mixture of this feed and formaldehyde-treated soya-bean meal (‘protein’ supplement). Digesta flows at the abomasum were estimated from the concentrations of the markers CrEDTA and ruthenium phenanthroline complex, during their administration by continuous intra-rumen infusion. Digesta samples were taken at 09.00 hours and at six further times at 4 h intervals. This was repeated 2 d later. 2. No significant difference in flow between days was noted. Daily flows of dry matter (DM) and non-ammonia-nitrogen (NAN) (g/d) in supplemented ewes were significantly higher than in unsupplemented ewes, both in total digesta and its particulate phase. However, there were significant differences between sampling times or significant interactions between sampling time and supplement treatment. The results were therefore examined by Fourier analysis for possible circadian variation in digesta flow. As there was marked between-animal variability in flow-rate, the digesta-flow values for each sampling time were re-expressed as percentages of the flows calculated from daily mean marker concentrations. 3. In unsupplemented animals, marked and significant circadian variation was then identified in the flow of DM, total N and NAN in both whole digesta and the particulate phase. There was also significant circadian variation in the flow of DM, total N and NAN in the digesta of the supplemented ewes. Curves were of the same general shape as those for unsupplemented animals, but some significant differences were found, principally for digesta NAN flow. In both supplemented and unsupplemented animals, peak flows occurred in the period 20.00–01.00 hours. The proportion of DM and NAN flowing in the particulate phase was relatively constant through the day for unsupplemented ewes, but significant circadian variation occurred for supplemented ewes. 4. The possible mechanisms generating the circadian variation in digesta flow, such as grazing behaviour and the rumen digestion of supplements, are discussed. Values are also presented to indicate the extent of the likely errors if digesta flows were estimated from samples which did not represent all stages of the circadian pattern. © 1988, The Nutrition Society.

AB  - Jugular plasma concentrations of oestradiol-17β, prolactin, progesterone and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F-2α (PGFM) were measured at 2-h intervals during the last 4 days of pregnancy in 6 goats. During advanced labour and delivery, samples were obtained more frequently and assayed for oxytocin. The animals were housed in a barn with continuous dim lighting. A distinct pattern of oscillation in prolactin concentrations, with peaks during the late afternoon, was apparent during the last 3 days. Geometric means of peak concentrations doubled each day and became of longer duration; night-time nadir values remained low except during the last night before parturition. A progressive increase in oestradiol-17β, with mean levels doubling every 36 h, was apparent during the last 3 days. There was no sharp pre-partum increase in oestradiol-17β. Correlated (r = 0.83) with the increase in oestradiol-17β was a gradual increase in PGFM and when the latter reached ~1000 pg/ml, the non-reversible decline in progesterone reflecting pre-partum, luteolysis occurred. Subsequent changes in PGFM related closely to an approximately 20-fold increase in the ratio of oestradiol-17β to progesterone until maximal PGFM levels of 26.5 ± 4.2 ng/ml were reached at delivery. Basal concentrations of oxytocin (8-15 μU/ml) were measured before the last 60 min and markedly higher, though erratic, concentrations were detected at various times before appearance of the allantochorion. Maximal oxytocin values (range 180-1570 μU/ml) occurred within minutes before or after delivery of the first fetus. The results suggest that increased pre-partum production of oestradiol-17β, in addition to provoking sufficient release of prostaglandins to cause luteolysis, may modulate either the sensitivity or set-points for an endogenous rhythm in prolactin secretion at the end of pregnancy. The nature of the oxytocin changes suggest that, after labour has evolved sufficiently, delivery is precipitated by an abrupt increase in oxytocin secretion.

AB  - Doppler flow velocity waveforms in the fetal internal carotid artery were recorded in 21 normal pregnancies during fetal behavioural state 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep) according to Nijhuis and co-workers, from the 36th week of gestation onwards. The present study confirms the earlier finding of a significant reduction of the pulsatility index (PI) in state 2F as compared to state IF at 37-38 weeks of gestation and demonstrates that this difference in PI exists throughout the entire period, in which fetal behavioural states have been described. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that there is a significant reduction in PI of this vessel during the last 4 weeks of gestation, suggesting a haemodynamic redistribution, favouring blood supply to the brain during the latter weeks of gestation. © 1988 S.

AB  - A case of sleep apnoea syndrome in a pregnant patient is reported here. For obstetric reasons, and because of the possibility that a metabolic and respiratory acidosis associated with the apnoea syndrome might have developed, we decided to do a caesarian section. Orotracheal intubation was particularly difficult because of the patient's abnormal mandibular, palatal and retropharyngeal shape, which was probably the underlying cause of the apnoeic syndrome.

AB  - 1. The present paper reports the effects of dietary modifications on the diurnal pattern of concentrations of certain metabolites and hormones in the peripheral blood of lactating dairy cows. The cows were given fixed rations of hay and high-cereal concentrates in the proportions of 30:70 or 10:90 (w/w). The concentrates were given in either two or six equal meals daily; the hay was given twice daily. 2. Previous reports of the same experiment had shown that milk-fat yield and concentration were reduced by increasing the proportion of concentrates in the diet and increased by more frequent feeding of the concentrates. These changes could be explained in part by changes in rumen volatile fatty acid (VFA) proportions and mean daily concentrations of VFA, particularly propionic acid, and insulin in the peripheral blood, but these factors failed to explain all the increase in milk-fat concentration caused by more frequent feeding. 3. Analysis of blood samples taken at hourly intervals for 24 h at two stages of lactation showed that, in the cows fed six times daily, the concentrations of metabolites and hormones remained relatively constant over the day. In the cows fed twice daily, the concentrations of VFA, 3-hydroxybutyric acid and insulin all increased after both meals whereas the concentrations of glucose and growth hormone tended to fall. The concentration of non-esterified fatty acids tended to increase overnight and fall rapidly after the morning feed. The concentrations of glucagon, thyroxine and prolactin showed no clear pattern in relation to meals. The postprandial responses of propionate, insulin and growth hormone were greater with the higher concentrate diet. 4. The maximum concentration and the diurnal range of concentrations were reduced by more frequent feeding of both diets in the case of propionic acid and of the higher concentrate diet in the case of insulin, but the effects on insulin concentrations of more frequent feeding of the lower concentrate diet were smaller and not significant. The maximum concentration and the diurnal range of concentrations of growth hormone were unaffected by meal frequency. 5. It is concluded that the severity of milk-fat depression in cows fed twice daily is increased by the rapid rise in propionic acid concentration in the peripheral blood after a meal, which in turn increases insulin secretion and may be accompanied by a suppression of growth hormone release. This causes lipogenesis to be diverted towards adipose tissue at the expense of the mammary gland. In cows fed more frequently, VFA absorption is more evenly spread over the day and is not closely associated with changes in insulin or growth hormone concentrations. © 1988, The Nutrition Society.

CFM showed the patterns of active and quiet sleeps and the developmental changes. In term asphyxiated and preterm neonates, the abnormal CFM patterns were judged by comparing with normal ones. The cases with continuously low amplitude, monotonous, high voltage burst, periodic low amplitude, flat or suppression burst patterns showed neurological handicaps such as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, or resulted in death.

AB  - Two craniopagus twins sharing some common cerebral circulation but no common brain structures were recorded polygraphically and continuously observed for behavioral sleep states and wakefulness. The observations lasted 9.5 h when the twins were 12 weeks postgestation and for 24 h at 16 weeks post gestation, or ~4 weeks postterm. Sleep onsets were synchronous 67% of the time (±5 min), but arousals were synchronous only 38% of the time (±5 min) at 16 weeks postgestation. The recordings reported here are the longest ever made of craniopagus twins. This report is consistent with some interdependence of the sleep of each twin on the other. Possible reasons for this are discussed.

AB  - Neonatal EEG and sleep findings are presented from a longitudinal study of the effects of maternal alcohol and marijuana use during pregnancy. Infant outcome has been examined relative to the trimester(s) of pregnancy during which use occurred. Disturbances in sleep cycling, motility, and arousals were noted that were both substance and trimester specific. Alcohol consumed during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with disruptions in sleep and arousal, whereas marijuana use affected sleep and motility regardless of the trimester in which it was used. Although these findings are preliminary and based on a small sample of women exhibiting only moderate substance use during pregnancy, they do suggest that specific neurophysiological systems may be differentially affected by prenatal alcohol or marijuana exposure even in the absence of morphological abnormalities. © 1988 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Fetal lambs were prepared for chronic intrauterine recording of behavioral states and breathing movements during the third trimester of pregnancy. Pilocarpine administered directly to the fetus produced an immediate change from quiet sleep to arousal. Neither the time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep nor the latency to REM sleep was affected. Associated with this change in sleep-wake patterns, pilocarpine produced a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of fetal breathing movements. These effects of pilocarpine on behavioral states and breathing movements were blocked by atropine sulfate but not by methylatropine. We conclude that the increased incidence of breathing movements produced by pilocarpine are due, in part, to increased arousal at the expense of quiet sleep. As a result, the fetus alternates between arousal and REM sleep, and this behavioral pattern results in sustained breathing movements. In addition, pilocarpine increases the incidence of breathing movements in all three behavioral states. These effects of pilocarpine are mediated primarily via central muscarinic sites of action.

AB  - Recent discussions of the functional significance of ultradian rhythms emphasize their importance to human physiology. Over the past 25 years, electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep patterns have been used in assessing the cerebral and central nervous system maturation of neonates. Through an interdisciplinary effort, spectral (Fourier) methods have been developed to discriminate between the various stages of sleep based on EEG recordings. Nevertheless, there has been little effort to develop methods for the statistical analysis of sleep-state cycling. In particular, attention has primarily been focused on the ultradian rhythm of sleep as it cycles between two states, active or rapid eye movement (REM) and quiet or non-REM sleep. There are, however, several components of REM and non-REM sleep, as well as a transitional state (indeterminate sleep) and abrupt alterations of state (arousal). Moreover, few studies have investigated the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the neurophysiological development of infants as assessed through sleep or EEG patterns. In this article the theory of Walsh—Fourier analysis for discrete-valued (categorical) time series is used to investigate the spectral components of EEG sleep-state patterns of infants whose mothers abstained from drinking during pregnancy, and infants of mothers who used moderate amounts of alcohol continuously during pregnancy. The sample for this study is part of a larger cohort of women participating in a longitudinal study of substance use during pregnancy. The analysis is based on the finite Walsh—Fourier transform that is defined in terms of the Walsh functions. The square-wave Walsh functions form a complete orthonormal sequence on (0, 1) and take on only two values, +1 and –1 (“on” and “off”). This allows correlation of per-minute infant sleep-state records with square waveforms, and analysis of sleep-state cycles relative to per-minute switches from one sleep stage to another (termed sequency). The analysis consists of two parts. First, the article considers the problem of detecting whether a common sleep pattern exists in the unexposed and exposed groups of neonates separately. As expected, it is concluded that a common signal does exist in each group. Next, the spectral components of the sleep-state signals of the two groups are compared, and the differences between the two groups are discussed. © 1976 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mice, selectively bred for differences in ethanol-induced narcosis, were administered ethanol (2.9, 4.0, 4.5, or 5.0 g/kg) twice per day during the period of organogenesis. On gestation day 18, the dams were sacrificed and the uterine horns were examined for live, dead, and resorbed fetuses. Live fetuses were weighed and assessed for either skeletal or soft tissue anomalies. The 5.8 g/kg/day dose had no effect on prenatal mortality, litter size, body weight, or number of physical anomalies in either line. However, the alcohol-sensitive LS mice exposed to ethanol doses of 8.0 g/kg/day or more evidenced decreased body weights while weights for the alcohol-insensitive SS mice differed from controls at only the highest dose tested. The incidence of skeletal variants was increased in the LS mice exposed to the 10 g/kg/day ethanol dose. These results indicate genetically-mediated alcohol sensitivity increases susceptibility to some of the fetotoxic effects of in utero alcohol exposure. © 1989.

AB  - The effects of chronic addiction to, and withdrawal from, opiates on sleep have been described in experimental animals, in human adults and infants born to addicted mothers. These sleep alterations are seen through the first weeks of life. Thirteen maternally addicted babies were studied. Sleep samples were recorded and scored within a few days following birth and repeated 4 or 5 weeks later after recovery from the abstinence syndrome. A significant decrease in quiet sleep and increase of active sleep were found. The same alterations, although less marked, were observed in a follow up recording performed during the second month of life. Sleep alterations in addicted new-borns could be related to central nervous system (CNS) distress caused by withdrawal. The authors however propose a perturbation of endogenous opiates subsequent to fetal addiction as a cause of sleep alterations. © 1988.

AB  - We have previously shown that acute exposure to low-dose morphine stimulates arousal and breathing movements in the fetal lamb. We now report on the effects of subacute low-dose morphine exposure on the regulation of fetal sleep-wake behavior and breathing patterns. Morphine was infused to 11 fetal lambs (121-129 days gestation) at a constant rate of 400 μg/h for 7 days via a mini osmotic pump implanted subcutaneously in the maternal flank and connected directly to an indwelling catheter in the fetal vena cava. On day 1, morphine resulted in a state of arousal in all fetuses, with loss of quiet sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This response was greatly reduced by day 2 and was insignificant by day 3, despite continuous drug exposure. There was no decrease in plasma morphine levels. Two fetuses died during morphine exposure. Upon removal of the pump, all fetuses exhibited disturbances in their sleep cycles within 1-3 h, with an increase in arousal time and loss of REM sleep. The duration of the arousal and quiet sleep episodes was also greatly reduced. Such disturbances were noted for 3-4 days after termination of morphine infusion. Four fetuses were delivered prematurely (131-136 days) during this period. These results demonstrate the rapid onset of tolerance to low-dose morphine exposure in the fetus and the development of physical dependence, as manifested by a mild abstinence syndrome characterized by sleep-wake disturbances.

AB  - The FAO/WHO/UNU recommendations for energy requirements assume that the energy cost of sleep is equal to the basal metabolic rate (BMR). We have tested the validity of this assumption by analysing overnight and BMR measurements made by whole-body indirect calorimetry. Data from 80 healthy subjects measured on a total of 246 occasions have been used. In a subgroup of 40 normal lean subjects the mean ratio of overnight metabolic rate (Overnight MR): BMR was 0.95 (range 0.85-1.02, s.d. 0.04). The mean ratio of lowest sleeping metabolic rate (Lowest SMR): BMR was 0.88 (range 0.83-0.96, s.d. 0.04). Ratios of Overnight MR:BMR were not significantly affected by different levels of exercise on the preceding day. This ratio was significantly higher for subjects who were obese, late pregnant or attached to ECG electrodes. With the exception of the late pregnant subjects these groups had the same Lowest SMR:BMR ratios as the normal lean subjects, indicating that the higher Overnight MR was caused by disturbed sleep. The data suggest that the use of BMR to estimate overnight energy expenditure would introduce an average overestimate of approximately 5 per cent during the actual hours of sleep, but that when applied over 24 h the error becomes negligible.

AB  - Clomipramine, administered to neonatal rats, has been reported to produce adult behavioral and REM sleep abnormalities. They include decreased sexual behavior, increased ambulation in the outer part of an open-field arena, increased REM sleep % of total sleep time, and in descriptive data, short REM latency, and increased REM phasic events. Since these abnormalities resemble some found in human endogenous depression, we have hypothesized that the adult rats represent an animal model of depression. Diminished aggressive behavior is a common characteristic of endogenous depression. This study tested the validity of the animal depression model by determining in rats the effect of neonatal clomipramine on adult shock-induced fighting. Experimental rats were treated neonatally with clomipramine and control rats were treated neonatally with saline. When they matured, compared with control rats, experimental rats had significantly fewer offensive fighting responses, and significantly more defensive fighting responses. The findings add some support to the validity of the animal depression model produced by neonatal clomipramine. © 1988.

AB  - In order to perform a comparative analysis of the relationship between motor activity and sleep states in appropriate- and small-for-gestational-age neonates, 40 healthy (clinically and neurologically normal) full-term neonates (grouped according to their conceptional age: 37-38 and 39-41 weeks) were studied. Twenty were small-for-gestational-age, and 20 appropriate-for-gestational-age neonates acted as age-matched controls. Sleep states and motor activity were recorded polygraphically between 2 and 10 days of life. Movements of both upper and lower limbs were recorded with piezoelectric crystal transducers. The time movement was automatically measured with an accuracy of 0.01 s. In addition, the number of startles and sighs, and the 20-second epochs without movements as well as the longest period without movements were studied as a function of age and sleep states. When motor activity criteria in appropriate- and small-for-gestational-age neonates were compared with respect to age and sleep state, no significant differences could be demonstrated: (1) in all groups, the time movement was significantly higher in active than in quiet sleep (at least p < 0.05); (2) there was a noticeable decrease in time movement between the 37-38 and 39-41 week groups; (3) the number of startles as well as the 20-second epochs and the longest period without movements were significantly higher during quiet as compared to active sleep (p < 0.005), and (4) the number of sighs was significantly more numerous in active than in quiet sleep (p < 0.005). Our study demonstrates that motor activity is a well-established sleep-state-related parameter during the early neonatal period in both appropriate- and small-for-gestational-age neonates. Our findings show that selected healthy small-for-gestational-age full-term neonates resembled normal appropriate-for-gestational-age neonates as far as motor activity criteria are concerned.

AB  - The nonstress test (NST) is a helpful adjunct to the management of high-risk pregnancies. However, fetal sleep states may lead to falsely nonreactive tests. We assessed the usefulness of transabdominal acoustic stimulation of the fetus and demonstrated an approximately 50% reduction in the number of nonreactive tests and a shorter testing time. No change in the predictive reliability of a reactive test was observed. With regard to the intrapartum and neonatal outcome in women delivering within seven days of a reactive test, no difference between the incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, depressed one- or five-minute Apgar scores or operative intervention for fetal distress could be identified. A reactive test evoked by acoustic stimulation is as reliable as the NST. It offers the additional benefits of reduced testing time and a lower incidence of nonreactive testing time and a lower incidence of nonreactive tests.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of mouth movements during behavioural states 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep) in the near term human fetus. Thirty-six women participated. Fetal heart rate and fetal movements were recorded for 2 hours continuously. Videotapes with enclosed periods 1F and 2F were replayed to record fetal mouth movements in detail. During 1F, regular mouthing movements dominated (present in 74%), while jaw opening, yawn and grimace were only observed in 5 to 16% of the recordings. Tongue protrusion was not observed in 1F. In all 2F periods jaw opening was present (100%), while tongue protrusion, yawn and grimace were also frequently observed. Regular mouthing was observed in 2F in only two fetuses. For regular mouthing and sucking, onset-to-onset intervals of clusters, cluster duration, and number and frequency of movements within clusters were calculated. In all aspects the differences between these two types of movement were statistically significant. Within the clusters of regular mouthing a decline in the mouthing frequency was found. The data on fetal regular mouthing correspond with observations in the neonate. © 1988.

AB  - A total of 441 newborn infants with gestational ages between 30 and 40 weeks had EEG studies between 36 and 48 hours after birth. Their mothers had either abstained from alcohol during pregnancy or had ingested alcohol in one of four categories: occasional, moderate, binge or frankly alcoholic. The power of the EEG, using linear regression analysis, was significantly higher among infants of mothers in the occasional, binge and alcoholic categories than among infants of abstainers. Developmental changes in the EEGs of binge‐drinking mothers were even more striking than in those of the offspring of the alcoholic mothers. These results indicate that fetal exposure to alcohol interferes with normal maturation of the brain as early as 30 weeks gestation. Furthermore, exposure to frequent high quantities of alcohol may be even more harmful to the fetal brain than continuous chronic exposure. Développement de l'EEG entre 30 et 40 semaines de gestation chez les nourrissons normaux et ceux exposés á l'alcool Un total de 441 nouveaux‐nés, d'âge de gestation de 30 á 40 semaines ont eu des EEG de 36 á 48 heures après la naissance. Leurs mères, ou bien s'étaient abstenues d'absorption alcoolique durant la grossesse. ou bien avaient ingéré de l'alcool en se situant dans l'une des quatre catégories: absorption occasionnelle, modérée, ivresse aigüe (plus de 60 ml d'alcool au moins deux fois dans le mois) ou alcoolisme franc. A l'analyse de régression linéaire, la puissance de l'EEG était significativement plus élevée parmi les nourrissons des groupes occasionnel, ivresse aigüe et alcoolique, que ceux du groupe abstinence. Les modifications développementales des EEG du groupe des mères avec ivresse aigüe étaient même plus frappantes que celle du groupe des mères alcooliques. Ces résultats indiquent que l'exposition foetal à l'alcool interfère avec une maturation normale du cerveau dès 30 semaines de gestation. De plus, l'exposition fréquente à de hautes concentrations d'alcool peut être plus agressive pour le cerveau qu'une exposition chronique continue. Die Entwicklung des EEG zwischen der 30 und 40 Gestationswoche bei normalen und Alkohol‐exponierten Kindern Bei ingesamt 441 Neugeborenen mit einem Gestationsalter zwischen 30 und 40 Wochen wurden innerhalb 36 und 48 Stunden nach der Geburt EEGs abgeleitet. Ihre Mütter hatten während der Schwangerschaft entweder gar keinen Alkohol getrunken oder nach einer der vier Kategorien Alkohol konsumiert: gelegentlich, mäßg, intermittierender Abusus (>60ml Alkohol mindestens zweimal pro Monat) oder als richtige Alkoholikerin. Die Aussagekraft des EEG, unter Verwendung der linearen Regressionsanalyse, war signifikant höher bei den Kindern, deren Mütter gelegentlich, intermittierend stark oder als Alkoholikerin getrunken hatten, als bei den Kindern der abstinenten Mütter. Die entwicklungsbedingten Veränderungen im EEG waren bei den Kindern, deren Mutter sich manchmal betrunken haben, sogar noch auffallender als bei den Kindern der Alkoholikerinnen. Diese Ergebnisse zeigen, daß die Exposition eines Feten zu Alkohol der normalen Hirnreifung schadet und zwar schon im Gestationsalter von 30 Wochen. Außerdem kann die Exposition zu haüfigen großen Alkoholmengen noch schädlicher für das fetale Gehirn sein, als die kontinuierliche chronische Exposition. Desarrollo del EEG entre las 30 y 40 semanas de gestación en lactantes normales y en expuestos al alcohol Un total de 441 recién nacidos con edades gestacionales entre 30 y 40 semanas fue estudiado con EEG entre 36 y 48 horas del nacimiento. Sus madres o se abstuvieron del alcohol durante la gestacion o habian ingerido alcohol en una de las cuatro categorias siguientes: ocasionalmente moderadamente, mas de 60 ml de alcohol al menos dos veces al mes o eran francamente alcohólicas. El valor del EEG utilizando un anáisis lineal de regresión era significativamente más alto en los niños de madres en las últimas tres categorias que en las abstémicas Los cambios de desarrollo en 10s EEG de 10s hijos de las madres con más de 60 ml de alcohol eran aun mAs notables que en 10s hijos de alcohólicas. Estos resultados indican que la exposicion fetal al alcohol interfiere con la maduración normal del cerebro ya a las 30 semanas de gestación. Además, la exposición frecuente a altas cantidades de alcohol puede ser aún más nociva para el cerebro fetal que la exposición continua crónica. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The role of the systemic arterial chemoreceptors in regulating breathing movements was determined in 7 chronically catheterized fetal sheep with carotid denervation and vagal section. Fetal hypoxaemia (ΔPaO2 = -11.4 ± 0.6 mmHg) decreased significantly the incidence of rapid-eye-movements (control = 26 ± 1.5 min/h; hypoxia = 12 ± 2.6 min/h, P &lt; 0.001) and breathing activity (control = 18 ± 1.0 min/h; hypoxia = 8 ± 1.1 min/h, P &lt; 0.001). However, the lag in onset of inhibition (~8 min) was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) than for normal fetuses. The incidence of low voltage electrocortical activity was not affected. Hypercapnia (ΔPaCO2 = 9.5 ± 1.1 mmHg) increased significantly the incidence of rapid-eye-movements and breathing activity. Hypercapnia also increased the mean amplitude of breathing activity and reduced the average breath interval. Rapid-eye-movements and breathing activity were depressed significantly by hypoxaemic hypercapnia. These observations suggest that hypoxic inhibition does not require afferent activity from the aortic or carotid bodies nor from other chemoreflexes mediated by the vagus. However, such peripheral input may be responsible for a more rapid onset of inhibition in normal fetuses.

AB  - The effects of diphenhydramine on fetal behavioral states, breathing activity, blood gas status, arterial pressure and heart rate have been investigated in the fetal lamb after maternal or fetal drug administration to steady state in chronically instrumented pregnant sheep. During maternal drug infusion there were declines in the percentage of low voltage electrocorticographic (EGoG) pattern (55-46%), the percentage of low voltage ECoG activity containing rapid eye movements (80-55%), the overall incidence of fetal breathing (42-21%) and in the amount of breathing during low voltage ECoG activity (67-36%). These sedative like effects occurred at fetal plasma drug concentrations (~36 ng/ml) lower than those resulting in discernable central nervous system effects in adults. Drug infusion to fetus achieved higher fetal plasma drug levels (~448 ng/ml) and resulted in a transient decline in arterial PO2 and pH, associated with transient tachycardia and vigorous breathing movements during the initial portion of the infusion. There was also a significant fall in the amount of low voltage ECoG pattern (51-26%) and marked increases in the amount of intermediate voltage pattern (8-46%), and an increase in the occurrence of rapid eye movements during this intermediate voltage pattern (8-63%). In summary, diphenhydramine elicits significant effects in the fetal lamb, the precise nature of which varies with drug concentration.

AB  - A descriptive, correlational study was undertaken to identify nursing diagnoses selected by mothers during the first 72 hours after birth. The convenience sample of 231 women completed questionnaires listing 34 diagnoses. On average, each mother selected nine diagnoses of concern to her since the birth. Alteration in comfort, potential for growth, alteration in body fluids, impaired mobility, and sleep pattern disturbance were the most frequently selected diagnoses. Only 34.5% of the mothers identified knowledge deficit as a concern. Parity, type of delivery, and length of postpartum time influenced the diagnoses selected. The data suggest modifications in the focus of hospital‐based, postpartum nursing care. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - A chart review and telephone interview of 72 sexual abuse victims was conducted to determine if children and adolescents who are victims of sexual abuse suffer from symptoms similar to the "rape trauma syndrome," which has been reported in adults. Symptoms similar to the rape trauma syndrome were found in 48 of the 72 abused children and only 26 of the matched control group, p < .01. Common somatic complaints in the sexual abuse patients included dysuria, vaginal discharge and chronic abdominal pain. Some of the emotional and behavioral problems noted during the follow-up period among the sexual abuse patients included sleep problems, runaway behavior, and suicide attempts. The duration of abuse and age of the victim at the time of abuse significantly affected the frequency of reported somatic symptoms, but the type of abuse and type of assailant did not significantly affect the frequency of reported somatic and emotional reactions. There, was no difference in the occurrence of school problems and early pregnancy between sexually abused patients and controls. Since 67% of all sexually abused patients suffered from emotional and somatic reactions, close follow-up of these patients is indicated. © 1988.

AB  - Behavioural state 1F (quiet sleep) of the term fetus is defined on the basis of absence of eye and body movements, and the presence of a specific heart rate pattern (FHRP A), characterized by a stable heart rate with a small oscillation bandwidth. In the present paper the fetal heart rate pattern was studied in 39 enclosed periods with absence of fetal eye and body movements. In 37 periods the heart rate pattern met the criteria of FHRP A. Within FHRP A various distinct types of heart rhythm could be distinguished related to presence of breathing or regular mouthing and complete absence of movements. The bandwidth in the various heart rhythms differed significantly and was largest during breathing movements. During regular mouthing an oscillatory pattern was present with a frequency similar to the frequency of the clusters of mouthing movements. In 2 periods the heart rate deviated from the definition for FHRP A, i.e. a sinusoidal-like rhythm associated with sucking movements. These observations demonstrate the strong association between the fetal heart rate pattern and fetal movements during behavioural state 1F. © 1988.

AB  - To define the dose response of apnea and breathing to morphine we studied 12 fetuses at 116-141 days of gestation using our window technique. We instrumented the fetus to record electrocortical activity (ECoG), eye movements (EOG), diaphragmatic activity (∫EMG(di)), heart rate, carotid blood pressure, and amniotic pressure. Saline and morphine in doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 3 mg/kg were injected in random order in the jugular vein of the fetus during low-voltage ECoG. Fetuses were videotaped for evaluation of fetal behavior. We found 1) that saline did not elicit a response; 2) apnea, associated with a change from low- to high-voltage ECoG, increased from 2.2 ± 1.5 (SE) min in two fetuses at a dose of 0.03 mg to 20 ± 6.3 min in seven fetuses at 3 mg/kg (P < 0.005); 3) the length of the breathing responses, associated with a change from high- to low-voltage ECoG, were 15 ± 1.8 and 135.9 ± 18.1 min (P < 0.0005); 4) ∫EMG(di) x frequency, an index equivalent to minute ventilation, increased from 1,763 ± 317 arbitrary units to 10,658 ± 1,843 at 1.0 mg/kg and then decreased to 7,997 ± 1,335 at 3.0 mg/kg. These changes were related to a steady increase in ∫EMG(di), whereas frequency decreased at 3 mg/kg. There was an increase in breathing response to morphine plasma concentrations or morphine doses. These results suggest 1) that morphine given to the fetus produces an apnea associated with a change from rapid-eye-movement (REM) to quiet sleep, followed by an increase in breathing activity that in turn coincides with a shift from quiet to REM sleep; and 2) there is a good correlation between doses of morphine or plasma concentrations and the intensity of breathing response. The initial fetal apnea was expected but the mechanisms for the late increase in breathing with morphine remains unknown.

AB  - We studied breathing and behavioral response to increased arterial CO2 (Pa(CO2)) in 12 fetal sheep between 130 and 145 days of gestation. Of these 12 fetuses, 10 had an increase in Pa(CO2), through maternal rebreathing of CO2; in the other 2 fetuses CO2 was increased via an endotracheal tube and application of continuous distending airway pressure. We used our window technique to observe and videotape fetal behavior. The experiments consisted of recording breathing activity and behavior during resting conditions (1 low- and high-voltage ECoG cycle) and during administration of CO2. We measured electrocortical activity (ECoG), eye movements (EOG), electromyography of the diaphragm (EMG(di)) and neck muscles, tracheal (Ptr), amniotic, and carotid arterial pressures. Administration of CO2 by the rebreathing technique produced an increase in the amplitude of breathing activity as reflected by an increase in Ptr from 5.0 ± 0.6 to 12 ± 1.9 mmHg (P &lt; 0.01) and an increase in fEMG(di) from 32 ± 4 to 77 ± 8% max (P &lt; 0.001). Frequency increased due to a decrease in inspiratory (TI) and expiratory duration. Ptr/TI increased from 11.0 ± 2.0 to 37.4 ± 9.0 mmHg/s (P &lt; 0.05) and fEMG(di)/TI increased from 67 ± 7 to 221 ± 28% max/s (P &lt; 0.001). Although the response was at times prolonged into the transitional high-voltage zone, it did not persist during established high-voltage ECoG. Administration of CO2 via an endotracheal tube using a continuous positive airway pressure of about 40 mmHg was not able to induce breathing in high-voltage ECoG unless Pa(CO2) was &gt; 100 Torr and pH was &lt; 7.0. These changes were not associated with fetal arousal as defined by opened eyes and purposeful movements of the head. We conclude that the breathing response to CO2 in fetal sheep does not persist in high-voltage ECoG and that wakefulness is not part of the response.

AB  - This chapter focuses on the prenatal neurotransmitter programming of postnatal receptor function. The biogenic amine transmitter systems in the brain have far-reaching regulatory influence on both motor and mental function. A role for catecholamines dopamine (DA) in mediating certain mental functions is inferred from the actions of neuroleptic drugs, and agents such as amphetamine, on the DA system. A role for norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin in mediating mood, level of arousal and sleep is inferred from the actions of antidepressant drugs, agents whose biochemical activity resides in their inhibitory action on noradrenergic and serotonergic reuptake and on other presynaptic mechanisms. In contrast to postnatal animals, in which a reduction in transmitter supply results in a homeostatic increase in receptor density, the prenatal animal responds to similar conditions with a decrease in receptor density. It is very interesting, from this standpoint, that the cholinergic system is central in primary information transfer in the brain. © 1988, Academic Press Inc.

AB  - Neurobehavioral evaluations were conducted in neonatal monkeys (Macaca mulatta) exposed to narcotic analgesics during labor through their dams. Infants exposed to meperidine (2 mg/kg maternal dose) or alfentanil (0.1 mg/kg maternal dose) were compared with controls whose dams received no analgesic. Meperidine and alfentanil differ in pharmacologic properties related to maternal-fetal transfer and neonatal metabolism. Drug-exposed infants showed neurobehavioral effects over the first 3 days of life including depressed respiration (at birth), depressed environmental response to aversive stimuli (days 0, 1, and 2), more overnight sleep (day 1), and more quiet behavior patterns while awake (day 3). In addition, drug exposure was associated with increased elicited muscle tone early in the neonatal period and earlier maturation of sitting, standing, and walking. No effects on growth or health were noted, but drug-exposed infants had lower hematocrits and an earlier onset of a linear growth rate as reflected in body weight. No qualitative or quantitative differences were noted between the two drug treatments. Because behavioral effects were seen after the drug was eliminated, a direct pharmacologic action of the drug does not fully explain the findings. © 1988, C. V. Mosby Company. All rights reserved.

AB  - Infantile cot death is defined as the sudden, unexplained death of a baby in previous good health in which post-mortem and autopsy examinations fail to reveal any cause. The baby is found dead in the cot when it was thought to be sleeping. This obviously represents a major shock for the parents. This syndrome especially affects infants between the ages of two and four months and particularly boys. The incidence in France is about two cot deaths for one thousand births and is the major cause of death of infants in the late post-natal period in industrialised countries. For this reason, a number of medical teams have studied this entity over the last decade. These studies have resulted in a better understanding of this syndrome, even if no cause can be proposed at the present time, and they have also demonstrated the impact of this death on the next child and on the family. In 1980, following the initiative of a group of patients who had lost a child from cot death, an association for the research and prevention of this syndrome was formed at the Hopital Port-Royal in Paris. This association consists of parents and a medical team undertaking research into sleep in infants. The first part of this paper presents a summary of a retrospective study of the psychomotor development of 31 cot death victims. The second part describes the possible repercussions of cot death in the family. The third part discusses the bereavement process and the following pregnancy. Lastly, the author discusses the preventative approach which can be instituted in order to avoid interactive dysharmonies or psychosomatic disorders in the following child.

AB  - Three behavioral animal models have been described, a feline and a rodent model of chronic anxiety, and a rodent model of "fearless" behavior. The models have been obtained by pre- or perinatal exposure to diazepam (DZ) or RO 15-1788 which produced enduring postnatal deficits or enrichment, respectively, of brain benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors. The receptor-deficient one-year-old cat progenies showed hyperarousal, unabated restless behavior, delayed acquisition of instrumentally conditioned behavior, bizarre escape responses and absence or reduced alpha-like EEG activity. The receptor-deficient rat progencies, studied at the age of 5-6 months, showed a reduction of time spent in deep slow wave sleep, and inability to habituate to novel environment, such as the radial arm maze. In the maze, the behavior of these progenies was characterized by delayed and incomplete exploratory activity often terminated by sudden escape, numerous fecal deposits and significantly more frequent than normal errors of "working memory." On the other hand, in all aspects, the receptor-enriched progenies were superior to the control animals as well as to the receptor-deficient group, particularly when the animals were challenged by novel and "intimidating" visual and/or auditory stimuli. In addition, 12 out of 51 receptor-deficient rats reared for 18 months developed mammary fibroadenomas, while no such tumors were found in the group of 44 vehicle-exposed control animals. Increased density and affinity of BDZ brain recepotrs was also observed after adult rats were treated with RO 15-1788 administered water for 7 or 14 days. © 1988.

AB  - The development of circadian rhythms was examined in a precocious rodent species, the spiny mouse. Spiny mouse pups born and reared in constant darkness expressed robust circadian rhythms in locomotor activity as early as day 5 of life. Free-running activity rhythms of pups born and reared in constant darkness were coordinated with the dam on the day of birth. Postnatal maternal influences on pup rhythmicity are minimal in this species, as pups fostered on the day of birth to dams whose circadian phases were opposite to the pups' original dams were coordinated with their original dams on the day of birth. Studies using 2-deoxy-D-[1-14C]-glucose autoradiography showed that there were synchronous (coordinated) rhythms in metabolic activity in the maternal and fetal suprachiasmatic nuclei, directly demonstrating prenatal coordination of maternal and fetal rhythmicity. Maternal-fetal coordination of circadian phase was not the result of direct entrainment of the fetuses to the environmental light-dark cycle. These results demonstrate that there is prenatal communication of circadian phase in this precocious species, without demonstrable postnatal maternal influences on pup circadian rhythmicity. Spiny mice therefore represent an important animal model in which circadian rhythms in the postnatal period can be used to precisely assess prenatal influences on circadian phase.

AB  - Oestriol profile represents a functional parameter of the foetal placental unit. Basing on the fact that maternal cortisol regulates oestriol production via a negative feedback action on foetal hypothalamus, relative low serum oestriol concentrations in the morning are compared with increasing oestriol concentrations in the evening, spaced out at short-time intervals, pointing to a dynamic oestriol production of the foetal placental unit. The mean oestriol concentration in the morning and maximum peak values in the evening were determined as criteria of the oestriol profile. In normal pregnancies (n = 74) the oestriol concentration in the morning increases from an average value of 8.0 ng/ml in the 32th/33rd week to 11.6 ng/ml in the 40th/41st week of gestation. During the same period the peak values in the evening rise from 8.8 to 15.9 ng/ml. The mean cortisol concentrations in normal pregnancies (n = 49) from 32th to 41st week are in the range of 333 ± 88 ng/ml in the morning and 205 ± 66 ng/ml in the evening. There is not significant difference between individual weeks. The predictive value of the oestriol profile was assessed regarding the foetal outcome of 55 high-risk pregnancies. 32 newborn infants exhibited intrauterine growth retardation with birth weights below the 10th and 5th percentile, respectively. In this group 6 patients exhibited low oestriol values in the morning, whereas 12 demonstrated a pathological profile in the evening. In 11 of 12 high-risk pregnancies exhibiting pathological oestriol profile growth, retardation of the newborn was found to be below the 5th percentile. Cortisol concentrations do not significantly differ between normal and high-risk pregnancies. According to these results the predictive value of oestriol profile is superior to a single oestriol determination in the morning, indicating foetal risk, especially in growth retarded foetuses. Reduction of dynamic oestriol production of the foetal placental unit is not caused by a changed maternal adrenal function.

AB  - Meadow voles born to dams kept in short days (SD) beginning 5 or 11 weeks before parturition (SD-5, SD-11) had less developed testes, gained weight more slowly and built larger nests than did young gestated and maintained in long days (LD). Pelage development was greater in SD than in LD young at 21 and 45 days of age. At weaning, SD-5 young had less dense fur and shorter guard hairs than did SD-11 young, indicating that the photoperiodic history of dams before insemination affects the post-natal pelage development of their progeny. Short daylengths experienced by dams before mating may facilitate winter preparedness of their offspring.

AB  - The powerful magnetic fields produced by a controlled fusion experiment at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) necessitated the development of personnel-exposure guidelines for steady magnetic fields. A literature search and conversations with active researchers showed that it is currently possible to develop preliminary exposure guidelines for steady magnetic fields. An overview of the results of past research into the bioeffects of magnetic fields was compiled, along with a discussion of hazards that may be encountered by people with sickle-cell anemia or medical electronic and prosthetic implants. The LLNL steady magnetic-field exposure guidelines along with a review of developments concerning the safety of time-varying fields were also presented in this compilation. Guidelines developed elsewhere for time varying fields were also given. Further research is needed to develop exposure standards for both steady or time-varying fields. © 1987, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - To study the role of genetic factors in the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behaviour, dams of two rat lines developed to differ in voluntary alcohol intake, alcohol-preferring (AA) and alcohol-avoiding (ANA) rats were given a 5-10% alcohol solution mixed with a 1% sucrose solution as a sole drinking liquid throughout gestation. Sleep-wake behaviour of the offspring was studied at the ages of 7, 14 and 20 days, using a movement-sensitive mattress. In ANA rats, sleep recordings showed that prenatal alcohol exposure increased the percentage of waking but decreased the percentage of active sleep. Sleep-wake behaviour of the AA rats was not affected by alcohol exposure in utero. Prenatal alcohol exposure did not change open field behaviour in 1 month old rats, except that the alcohol-exposed AA rats' defaecation was decreased. When rats were 3 months old, voluntary intake of 10% (v/v) alcohol increased for alcohol-exposed ANA rats and decreased for alcohol-exposed AA rats as compared to the controls. The results indicate that AA rats may compensate for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behaviour, whereas offspring of the alcohol-exposed ANA dams suffer from severe behavioural disturbances. These Findings further suggest that genetic factors are responsible for the differences in the susceptibility of rat foetuses to alcohol-induced long-term effects on behaviour. © 1987 Medical Council on Alcoholism.

AB  - Restrictive lung disease patients exhibit a wide range of breathing and oxygenation abnormalities during sleep. The combination of degree of restriction, whether it is intrapulmonary or extrapulmonary, and confounding factors, such as obesity, age, and sex, will ultimately determine the degree of disturbed nocturnal physiology. The sleep literature is still sparse in most restrictive diseases. For patients with interstitial lung disease, the role of nocturnal oxygen in chronic established fibrosis, and also in acute alveolitis (e.g., farmer's lung, bird fancier's lung, etc.), has not been addressed. As fibrotic lung disease progresses, the degree of nocturnal desaturation and breathing dysrhythmias will progress. Changes in sleep architecture are likely related to the progression of the disease, but this is not known with certainty. Long-term evaluation of sleep and breathing in interstitial lung disease will give further insight into whether or not sleep changes are primary or secondary events. For kyphoscoliosis patients, again, we need more information on sleep as the thoracic deformity changes. In addition, the use of drugs (acetazolomide, medroxyprogesterone, and almitrine) and/or nasal CPAP to treat nocturnal desaturation needs to be assessed in a controlled fashion. In neuromuscular disease, the dynamics of gas exchange and sleep structure need to be defined in a larger group of patients. Factors such as degree of muscle weakness, degree of underlying lung diseases, and medications must be taken into consideration. Nocturnal hypoxemia may cause muscle weakness and fatigue, which in time, could cause more nocturnal hypoventilation and further hypoxemia. Supplemental nocturnal oxygen should be evaluated in this population.

AB  - Pharmacodynamic effects of [6-(5-chloro-2-pyridyl-6,7-dihydro- 7-oxo-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-5-yl]-4-methyl-1-piperazine-carboxylate (zopiclone, RP-27267), chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines and a potential new sleep inducer, on the peripheral system were investigated in several species of animals. The drug was dissolved in the vehicle of 0.01 mol/l HCl solution for intravenous administration or for addition to the bath medium and was suspended in 0.25% carboxymethylcellulose solution for oral administration. In unanesthetized rabbits, zoipiclone, 0.5 mg/kg i.v., exerted no action and at 1 mg/kg slightly decreased respiration and heart rate without affecting blood pressure and ECG. Zopiclone at 10-6 g/ml had no action in the isolated guinea-pig atria but at 10-5 g/ml it produced a gradual and slight decrease in heart rate without affecting the contraction. In the isolated small intestine of rabbits and guinea-pigs, zopiclone at 10-6 g/ml had no action but produced a slight inhibition in a dose of 10-5 g/ml. Zopiclone, 10-5 g/ml, did not affect the stimulatory effects of acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine and barium in the isolated guinea-pig intestine. Zopiclone, 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg i.v., exerted no action on rabbit intestinal movement in vivo. Zopiclone, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg/kg p.o., had no effect on the propulsive motility on the mouse intestine. Zopiclone, 10-5 g/ml, did not affect contractile movement of the uterus isolated from rabbits and did not influence the contractile response to epinephrine. In the in vivo uterine contractile movement of non-pregnant and pregnant rabbits, zopiclone, 5 and 10 mg/kg i.v., exerted little or no action, preceded by a slight temporary inhibition or excitation. In the isolated guinea-pig trachea, zopiclone, 10-5 g/ml, had no action and did not alter the stimulatory effect of acetylcholine or the inhibitory effect of isoprenaline. Zopiclone did not exert actions in the isolated guinea-pig vas deferens at 10-5 g/ml and did not influence the stimulatory effects of norepinephrine. Zopiclone, 10-6 and 10-5 g/ml, induced no alteration in the twitch tension of rat diaphragm. Zopiclone, 1 mg/kg i.v., had no effect on the bile outflow in rabbits, and doses of 10-6 and 10-5 g/ml did not evoke hemolysis. In conclusion, zopiclone exerts weak actions on peripheral systems.

AB  - Graded anemia was produced for 2 h in 10 unanesthetized fetal sheep by infusing plasma in exchange for fetal blood. This reduced the mean fetal hematocrits during the 1st h of anemia to 19.7 ± 0.5% [control (C) = 28.2 ± 1.1%] for mild anemia, 17.4 ± 0.9% (C = 30.0 ± 1.1%) for moderate anemia, and 15.1 ± 1.0% (C = 29.2 ± 1.3%) for severe anemia. The respective mean arterial O2 contents (Ca(O2) were 4.46 ± 0.20, 3.89 ± 0.24, and 3.22 ± 0.19 ml/dl. Mean arterial Po2 was reduced significantly (by 2 Torr) only during moderate anemia, and mean arterial pH was decreased only during severe anemia. No significant changes occurred in arterial PCO2. Fetal tachycardia occurred during anemia. Mean arterial pressure was reduced by 2-3 mmHg during mild anemia; however, no significant blood pressure changes were observed for moderate or severe anemia. The incidence of rapid-eye movements and breathing activity was not affected by mild anemia, but the incidence of both was reduced significantly during moderate and severe anemia. It is concluded that 1) a reduction in Ca(O2) of &gt;2.48 ± 0.22 ml/dl by hemodilution inhibits rapid-eye movements and breathing activity, and 2) the Po2 signal for inhibition does not come from arterial blood but from lower Po2 in tissue.

AB  - Experiments were performed to determine whether the restraint stress-induced decrease in the proestrous prolactin (PRL) surge blocked luteolysis of the corpora lutea (CL), affected ovulation, or prevented the induction of pregnancy/pseudopregnancy in the next cycle. In all experiments rats were either stressed on proestrus and estrus, administered daily sc injections of 1 mg/day of 2-Br-α-ergocryptine (CB-154) for 4 days starting on diestrus II or not treated. In one experiment animals were sampled on the afternoon of proestrus to determine the effect of restraint stress on plasma PRL values and sacrificed on the morning of proestrus in the next cycle. Ovaries were removed, weighed, fixed and examined for number of CL. Restraint stress resulted in a significant increase in ovarian weight when compared to controls; CB-154 resulted in significant increases in ovarian weight when compared to stress and control animals. However, only CB-154-treated animals had a significant increase in the number of CL when compared to controls. In another experiment, animals were sacrificed on estrus of the next cycle and the oviducts examined for the number of ova. There were no differences among groups. In the final experiment, animals were placed with males of proven fertility on proestrus of the next cycle and examined for evidence of sperm in the vaginal lavage and/or vaginal plugs. CB-154 prevented the induction of pregnancy or pseudopregnancy due to a carry over effect of the drug on PRL surges. Restraint stress has no significant effect on the induction of pregnancy or pseudopregnancy. We conclude that there is no physiological significance to the stress-induced decrease of the proestrous PRL surge with respect to ovarian function or fertility. © 1987.

AB  - A radioassay for the measurement of cortisol binding capacity in human serum was developed and the results validated by radioimmunoassay of serum corticosteroid binding globulin. The mini-scale method is simple, reliable and rapid, and avoids separation of partitioned phases. The linear correlation between the free cortisol index and free cortisol concentration as calculated by the two methods utilizing serum samples with normal and abnormal protein concentrations was r = 0.962 (n = 114, p < 0.001) and the regression equation was y = 3.516 x - 2.632. The technique requires no preparation of reagents, and the assay can be performed in 45 minutes using 0.05 ml of serum or plasma.

AB  - A significant diurnal variation in the rates of lipogenesis in vivo in brown adipose tissue occurred in both virgin and lactating rats. On a meal-feeding regime of either a chow, high-sucrose, or high-lipid diet, there was a very large increase in BAT lipogenesis following the meal. The rates observed after the sucrose meal are the highest so far reported. There was no significant difference in BAT lipogenesis between lactating and virgin rats, contrary to previous reports by others. The pattern of stimulation of BAT lipogenesis by these feeding regimes was different from that for white adipose tissue and liver and was not correlated with plasma insulin levels. © 1987 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Pain is a primary component of normal childbirth as evidenced by the behavior of parturients in primitive societies. Methods of pain relief such as the use of herbs and plant extracts were described in ancient writings. Modern obstetric analgesia employing ether began in 1847, three months after the first successful surgical anesthetic. Administration of chloroform and nitrous oxide followed. Twilight sleep, a combination of morphine and scopolamine, became popular in the beginning of the twentieth century as did regional analgesia, first single injection and later continuous blockade via catheter. Simultaneously, psychologic methods were propagated, but were not uniformly successful. Continuous lumbar extradural analgesia has evolved as the optimal method of bsotetric pain relief, both subjectively and objectively, and its combination with childbirth education is considered to be complementary. The increasing utilization of obstetric analgesia and the recognition of marked physiologic and pharmacologic differences between pregnant and nonpregnant patients has led to the development of the subspecialty of obstetric anesthesia as well as to the foundation of obstetric anesthesia societies.

AB  - Experiments were performed to determine whether restraint stress decreases the two prolactin (PRL) surges in pseudopregnant (PSP) rats in a manner similar to the stress-induced decrease of the proestrous PRL surge. Adrenal involvement as well as adaptation of the response was also investigated. Vaginal cycles were followed and animals exhibiting 2-3 normal cycles were cervically stimulated (CS) electromechanically to induce PSP. In one experiment the effect of adrenalectomy (ADX) on the nocturnal surge (NS) was investigated and was found to have no effect. In another set of experiments the effect of restraint stress was investigated. Immediately following an initial sample, the animals to be stressed had their hind legs tied together with plastic coated bell wire. Subsequent samples were taken for 3 hours. Restrain stress decreased the NS to 15% of the initial value within 30 minutes. ADX did not alter this response. Furthermore, 6-9 days of 3 hours of restraint stress did not attenuate the stress-induced decrease of the NS. Restraint stress also depressed the diurnal surge in PSP rats. These results indicate that restraint stress applied during the two PRL surges of PSP results in significant decreases in plasma PRL and that this response is not altered by ADX or by habituation to the stimulus. © 1987.

AB  - Twelve Holstein heifers, pregnant from 120-150 days were used to study the circadian rhythm of aldosterone, cortisol, progesterone, sodium and potassium in dairy cattle during the summer in Louisiana. Cortisol was not significantly influenced by time (time 1 = 06.00 h). Aldosterone, sodium, potassium and progesterone changed significantly (P<.01) with time. Aldosterone peaked (116.5±17.2 pg/ml) at 08.00 h and then generally declined to 16.00 h (26.7±2.0 pg/ml). Sodium generally increased from 06.00 h (320.1±7.3 mg%) to 18.00 h (377.9±6.1 mg%), and then declined. Potassium generally increased from 06.00 h (20.9±0.5 mg%) to 22.00 h (23.0±0.3 mg%). Progesterone generally increased from 07.00 h (2.8±0.4 mg/ml) to 24.00 h (7.5±1.4 mg/ml). Aldosterone was significantly related to temperature associated with the time of the day samples were taken (r = 0.66, P<.02). © 1987 Swets & Zeitlinger.

AB  - Oral ketamine (7.5 mg X kg-1) was used to induce general anaesthesia in fourty seven young women undergoing voluntary abortion. Additional anaesthesia was necessary eight times because pre operative consciousness remained normal, and nine times because of important intra operative reactions. A majority (78.8%) of patients appreciated this technique of anaesthesia. Absence of narcosis (17%) and intra operative analgesia (23%) and frequency of post operative nightmares may require some modifications of the method.
Ketamine was administered to 47 women aged 14-41 years who were about to undergo induced abortions. The patients received 2.5 mg of lorazepam 2 hours before the operation and 7.5 mg/kg of ketamine diluted in orange juice or water 45 minutes before. In all cases, sleep and transfer to the operating table were accomplished in calm and semidarkness. Intravenous tubes were inserted and .02 mg/kg of atropine sulfate was administered. Patients considered still conscious were given intravenous injections of ketamine 1 mg/kg. Perioperative evaluation of the quality of anesthesia was done using a 4-level scale based on reactions to stimuli. Ketamine .5 mg/kg was administered intravenously each time significant reactions were obtained. 45 minutes after oral ketamine administration, 8 patients were still conscious and received additional anesthesia. 9 of the 39 patients asleep at the preoperative evaluation required additional anesthesia during the procedure. The immediate postoperative period was calm in all cases, even though some patients later reported having had disagreeable hallucinations. 46.8% had vomiting. The frequency of vomiting declined from 54.4% to 28.8% when pure water was substituted for orange juice as the vector for the preoperative oral ketamine. Correct responses to simple questions were obtained an average of 12.4 minutes postoperatively, but all patients had periods of somnolence lasting 4.8 hours on average. 15 had partial recollections of the surgery. 78.8% of the patients stated that the anesthesia used was excellent or good. 8.5% felt it was average, and 10.6% felt it was poor. Very few publications mention oral use of ketamine. The failure rates of 17% during the preoperative evaluation and 23% during the operation were not negligible and were probably due to the very low bioavailability of ketamine administered orally and the variability of digestive absorption of ketamine from 1 subject to another. The method appears to be appropriate for use in induced abortions, but better management is required to reduce failure rates and control side effects of vomiting and disagreeable postoperative hallucinations.

AB  - Lactating rats consuming a control diet (20% casein) ad libitum and kept on a 12-h light-dark cycle produced milk during the dark phase at a rate 50% greater than that during the light period. Diurnal variations in the food consumptions of these animals, maternal live weights and litter weight gains were also observed. This diurnal variation with respect to milk production and food consumption appears to be abolished by feeding a low protein (10% casein) diet. However, the variation was amplified when the amount of the control diet was restricted to 25 g/d and made available at the middark period; this was probably related to the meal-feeding behavior of these rats because they consumed all their food within 6 h after it was made available. The rates of fatty acid synthesis in the mammary glands, livers and adipose tissue measured in vivo from [3H]H2O incorporation also varied diurnally with maximal rates at the middark period. Similar rates were obtained for the rats receiving restricted amounts of the control diet measured in the feeding period, whereas the values for the rats fed the low protein diet in the dark period tended to be significantly lower. The milk fatty acids were also analyzed, and whereas no diurnal differences were detected in the samples taken from control rats, a marked reduction in the proportion of the medium-chain acids was observed in the samples from rats receiving restricted amounts of the control diet taken immediately before the normal feeding period.

AB  - 1. The experiments were aimed at determining the means by which lung liquid volume is controlled in fetal sheep. Six unanaesthetized chronically catheterized fetuses between 121 and 144 days of gestation were used in experiments in which lung liquid volume was acutely reduced or increased. 2. The effects on lung liquid volume, secretion and flow in the trachea were continuously monitored until the original volume was restored. Tracheal pressure, breathing activity, electrocortical activity and laryngeal adductor muscle activity were also monitored. 3. Following a mean reduction in lung liquid volume of 54.1% (40.0 +/‐ 4.3 ml) there was a reduction in tracheal pressure of 1.91 +/‐ 0.26 mmHg. There was no change in the rate of lung liquid secretion and there was a near cessation in its rate of efflux from the trachea. Influx of liquid from the upper airway was rarely seen. 4. 5 h after its reduction, lung liquid volume had returned to control values. Tracheal pressure and the rate of liquid flow in the trachea returned to control values over 7‐8 h. 5. In the hour following the reduction in lung liquid volume the incidence and amplitude of fetal inspiratory muscle electromyogram (e.m.g.) activity were reduced by 19% and 28% respectively. There was no change in laryngeal adductor muscle activity or in the duration of fetal sleep states. 6. When lung liquid volume was increased by 25.4 +/‐ 3.1 ml tracheal pressure increased by 2.01 +/‐ 0.17 mmHg. Although there was no change in the rate of liquid secretion there was a rapid efflux of liquid from the trachea principally during epochs of fetal breathing activity thus returning lung liquid volume to its control value. 7. Following the increase in lung liquid volume there were no changes in the incidence or amplitude of fetal inspiratory muscle activity, the activity of laryngeal adductor muscles or in the duration of sleep states. 8. It is concluded that following its alteration in fetal sheep lung liquid volume is restored by passive means. There was no evidence of volume‐receptive neural reflexes being activated in defence of lung liquid volume. © 1987 The Physiological Society

AB  - The development of ambulatory surgery has favored use of rapidly eliminated anesthetic agents or at least those whose clinical effects are easily predictable. Central analgesics such as fentanyl have not been very satisfactory; fentanyl is believed to have a short duration of action, but it has also been found to have a long half-life. A comparative study was conducted to determine whether the newer alfentanil would be more suitable for use in ambulatory surgery. 30 patients undergoing induced abortions arrived fasting at the hospital on the morning of the operation and were premedicated intravenously with .18 mg/kg midazolan and 2.2 mcg/kg of fentanyl or 24.2 mcg/kg of alfentanil. The efficacy of the premedication was assessed 5 minutes later just prior to anesthesia induction, which was achieved with 40 mcg/kg of alphadione. The delay to sleep was assessed by the disappearance of reflexes and of pain reaction. The delay to awakening was assessed by spontaneous opening of the eyes, response to a simple command, and unaided sitting up. Psychometric tests were administered 2 and 4 hours after anesthesia and compared to preoperative performance of the same tests. The 15 fentanyl and 15 alfentanil patients did not differ significantly in height, weight, or age. Premedication was considered good in the 15 fentanyl patients but excessive in 7 of the 15 alfentanil patients because of depressed respiration. There were no significant differences in pulse rate in the 2 groups. Systolic blood pressure diminished significantly in the 2 groups after induction but values returned to normal after 3 minutes. The respiratory response was significantly more marked and more prolonged in the alfentanil group, with respiratory frequency declining from 18 to 9 breaths/minute with 3 apnea episodes for 15 patients. Respiratory frequency declined from 19 to 15 breaths/minute in the fentanyl group. The average delay to sleep was shorter in the alfentanil group but the difference was not statistically significant. The duration of the operations was comparable in the 2 groups. Reinjection of analgesic was necessary for a few patients in each group. The difference was not statistically significant although the anesthesia appeared more stable in the alfentanil group. Awakening time appeared more rapid in the alfentanil group but the difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in the test results for the 2 groups 2 and 4 hours after anesthesia. The results of this study do not appear to provide a decisive argument in favor or alfentanil for short term anesthesia.

AB  - The roles of the maternal suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and fetal brain in the circadian-gated timing of birth were studied in rats. The circadian gating of birth was shown by exposing different groups of dams to lighting cycles of opposite phase during pregnancy. Regardless of the phase of the prenatal lighting cycle, the time of birth was gated over a 36-h temporal window so that most births occurred during subjective day. Destruction of the maternal SCN eliminated the circadian gating; births occurred in a single distribution that peaked in the middle of the 36-h window. Removal of the fetal brain also disrupted the circadian gating of birth; dams of brain-aspirated fetuses no longer exhibited a daytime preference for births. These results show that the maternal SCN are necessary for the normal circadian gating of birth and are also consistent with a role for the fetal brain in this process. © 1987.

AB  - Post-natal manifestation of circadian rhythms was examined in individual rats in order to clarify the manner in which pups' circadian oscillation entrained to the maternal circadian system. Ablation of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a putative circadian pacemaker, completely eliminated the circadian rhythms of spontaneous locomotor activity and plasma corticosterone level in pregnant rats. However, all pups born to mothers whose SCN were lesioned at day 10 of gestation showed free-running circadian rhythms of plasma corticosterone level with similar phase angles after the 4th week of postnatal life. Strong positive correlations between the phases of circadian locomotor rhythm at the day of weaning and each free-running period (tau) were observed in blinded pups nursed under identical lighting schedule (LD). The fact suggests that the individual circadian oscillation was in phase on a certain day before the weaning. Mother-pups exchange under reversed lighting schedule (LD and DL) and nursing under 4-hourly restricted daily feeding (RF) indicated that nursing mother rat could essentially phase-set the circadian locomotor rhythm of blinded pups when the conditions during nursing were artificially modified. The weight of neonatal rats was measured every 4 hours from day 1 to day 3 and day 9 to day 10 after birth, and 4-hourly weight gains showed apparent circadian periodicity from day 2 of age. Under ad-lib feeding of mother rats, pups' weight mainly increased during daytime but the phase of weight rhythm shifted under RF corresponding to the feeding time of the mother. These findings suggest that the circadian oscillation underlying the spontaneous locomotor activity and plasma corticosterone level in rats has entrained to the maternal circadian system during fetal life, and nursing mother is capable of phase-setting the circadian oscillation of blinded pups probably through the rhythmicity of the lactation.

AB  - Chronobiological rhythms contribute to our understanding of the effect of alcohol and of several features of alcoholism. The observation of infradian periodicities suggests preventive seasonal strategies aimed at reducing the consumption of alcohol and its consequences. Circadian variations in blood alcohol levels and behavioral impairment indicate a complex temporal rhythmicity with both physiological and psychosocial determinants. Circadian differences are noted among possible mediators of susceptibility towards alcoholism. Ultradian patterns may be of prognostic value in assessing risks such as that of relapse during withdrawal from alcohol. Recommendations for future animal and human investigations are suggested.

AB  - Abstract. Fetal heart rale and fetal movements were recorded over a 24-hour interval in a totally adrenalectomized pregnant woman at term. Cortisol. ACTH, unconjugated estriol and 17β-estradiol were contemporaneously measured every 2 h in the maternal peripheral plasma. Owing to the substitution therapy the patient showed a loss of circadian variations of all the hormones investigated. Moreover, the circadian rhythms of fetal heart rate and fetal movements, usually present at term, were no longer evident. We can thus suggest that the circadian variations of plasma maternal Cortisol could affect the alternations of fetal behaviour. © 1987 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Alterations in circadian rhythms have previously been associated with estrous and seasonal changes in reproductive state. In the present study we explored the effects of the reproductive events of pregnancy and parturition on free-running circadian activity rhythms in the rat. Free-running rhythms were monitored before mating, during pregnancy, and following parturition and removal of pups. Systematic and long-lasting alterations of the period of the free-running activity rhythm were seen following parturition. The effects of estrous, seasonal, and gestational reproductive states on circadian rhythms may be mediated by the endocrine events which accompany these states. © 1987 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - In many seasonally breeding species, the nocturnal melatonin rhythm is part of an endogenous biological clock mediating information about day length to time the onset of puberty and the annual adult reproductive cycle. To determine whether timekeeping persists during pregnancy, we studied the pattern of melatonin in circulation in sheep during the last trimester of gestation. We measured plasma melatonin concentrations in the chronically catheterized ewe and fetus (n = 6) over a 48-h period (every 1-4 h) at ~120 days gestation. A typical rhythm was present in the pregnant ewes; plasma melatonin was low during the day and remained increased throughout the night. In the fetus, a modest 24-h pattern was detected, which lagged 0.5-1.5 h behind that of the maternal circulation. In combination with findings later in gestation (126 and 135 days) or even during parturition, it is clear that melatonin rhythms were sustained in all pregnant ewes and a 24-h pattern was present in the fetus. In those sheep that went to full term, births occurred during the night at 0130 ± 2.6 h (mean ± SE, n = 3). These findings suggest that measurement of day length is maintained in female sheep during the last trimester of pregnancy. Moreover, information about day length is maintained in female sheep during the last trimester of pregnancy. Moreover, information about day length and/or time of day may be transferred across the placenta, because the pattern of melatonin in fetal circulation follows the maternal circadian melatonin rhythm.

AB  - Phase setting of the circadian rhythm by restricted daily feeding (RF) was examined in rat pups. Feeding of virgin, pregnant, and nursing rats together with pups was restricted to 4 h at a fixed time of the day. Phases of the circadian rhythm developed in neonatally blinded pups were measured on the day of weaning to evaluate the effect of RF on phase setting. The activity onset and offset of the locomotor rhythm were used for the phase reference. In blinded pups born and raised under ad libitum feeding, the phase at weaning was a function of the free-running period measured after weaning and located in a narrow range (control zone). When RF was imposed from 2 wk prior to the conception (C), until weaning (3w), the pups phases were located outside the control zone and related to the feeding time. To identify the period in which the phase setting is effective, RF was imposed during 5 different periods (C-Ow, C-1w, C-2w, 2-6w, and 3-6w). The circadian rhythm of all pups in the C-2w group and some in the C-1w was phase set, but those in other groups were not affected. It is concluded that RF imposed during the early nursing period is capable of phase setting the circadian system of blinded infant rats.

AB  - We have previously shown a marked diurnal variation in the excretion of Cortisol and 6β-hydroxyCortisol at 36–38 weeks pregnancy with no variation in estrogen excretion. Since others have shown a reciprocal relationship between plasma levels of estriol and Cortisol at 30–35 weeks of pregnancy, we decided to determine whether a similar relationship was present in urinary concentrations of Cortisol, 6β-hydroxycortisol and estriol at this gestational age. A significant variation in excretion of both Cortisol and 6β-hydroxycorlisol was found. The variation in urinary levels of estriol was less than that of the corticosteroids but followed the same pattern. © 1987 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - The spontaneous movement of 41 healthy human newborns was analyzed for cyclic patterns during different behavioral states and also compared to similar data obtained during their last few months of gestation. Spectral analysis was used to identify and quantify the motility cycles, except in quiet sleep, for which the instantaneous frequency of the isolated movements was analyzed. Cyclic motility (CM) was common in all states, and measures of its cyclic organization were similar in the nonsleep states in spite of very large differences in the total amount of movement. During active sleep, CM was weaker and less regular than during the non‐sleep states, but similar to fetal CM during the last month of gestation. Thus cyclic variation in spontaneous motor activity, a basic feature of fetal behavior, is also a nearly constant feature of newborn spontaneous movement. Fetal CM persists relatively unchanged in the newborn during active sleep, and the cyclic organization of newborn movement is independent of the level of motor output.

AB  - This study evaluates the ethanol toxicity for fetal development at different circadian stages. Pregnant mice were given a single intraperitoneal ethanol injection on day 7, 8, or 10 of gestation at one of four circadian stages (0700, 1300, 1900, or 0100 hr). The dams were killed on the day before term (day 18). Prenatal exposure to ethanol resulted in an increased number of resorptions, reduced fetal body weight, and produced an increased incidence of external alterations. The severity of damage was related to the dose, the period of gestation, and particularly to the circadian stage at the time of treatment. Ethanol had the greatest effect on the embryo of a mouse when administered at the mid‐dark span. Consequently exposure to a single dose of ethanol at one time or another along the 24‐hr time scale during organogenesis has important implications for the substantially increased risk.

AB  - Our objectives were to determine whether the embryotoxic and teratogenic potential of cytosine arabinoside (Ara‐C) differs depending on the time of day. Pregnant CD‐1 (ICR) mice were placed in an environment where the phases of lighting and darkness were reversed by progressive phase‐delay or phase‐advance methods—2 h every day from day of gestation (dg) 2 to dg 7 (or 6). After it was confirmed that these progressive phase‐shifting methods had no effect on embryonic growth and pregnancy outcome, 5 mg/kg body weight (bt) of Ara‐C was injected intraperitoneally into these animals at 1000 or 1600 on dg 11, and the incidence of gross fetal malformations was compared with that in control dams treated similarly but under a regular lighting regimen (0600–1800). In contrast to previous reports on other teratogens, no diurnal difference was observed in fetal susceptibility to the teratogenic potential of Ara‐C. The possible usefulness of the progressive phase‐shifting method in the field of chronoteratology is proposed. Copyright © 1987 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - Sleep of two lissencephalic children was studied. The sleep-waking cycle was recorded for a long period, and the all-day polysomnography was carried out twice on each case. Case 1 was a 1-year-old boy of agyria, and case 2 was a 2-year-old boy of pachygyria. Clinically, both were severely retarded, hypotonic and suffering from seizures of infantile spasms. The sleep-waking cycle of case 1 showed alternating periods of free-running and chaotic rhythms. The cycle of case 2 showed a typical free-running rhythm. The all-day polysomnography in both cases disclosed that the REM time decreased as the frequency of seizures increased. These seizures showed a periodicity closely related to the REM cycle. Various characteristics of the REM sleep in adults were recognized also in our cases. Every physiological parameter including EEG, eye movements, chin EMG, body movements and respiration, fluctuated in a rhythmic and mutually synchronized manner, although each showed abnormality commonly encountered in cases of infantile spasms. The clocks of circadian and ultradian rhythms were preserved in the lissencephalic brains which were morphologically similar to those of normal fetuses in the fourth month of gestation. However, these clocks synchronized poorly with their environments. The most conspicuous disturbance of the sleep in lissencephaly was the lack of entrainment. © 1987, The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. All rights reserved.

AB  - We have measured fetal and maternal plasma concentrations of cortisol, prolactin, GH and glucose in samples collected during a 24-h period in 14 animals between 127 and 142 days of gestation. There was a significant increase in both the mean daily plasma cortisol concentration and mean daily coefficient of variation (C.V.) of plasma cortisol concentrations after 135 days of gestation. There was also a significant variation in the fetal plasma cortisol concentrations with a peak occurring at 19.00h. There was a significant sinusoidal diurnal rhythm in the plasma prolactin concentrations in both the fetal sheep and pregnant ewe and the maximal prolactin concentrations occurred between 19.00 and 23.00h (fetal) and 21.00 and 01.00h (maternal). Although no significant diurnal variation was detected in fetal plasma GH concentrations, there was a significant sinusoidal diurnal rhythm in the plasma GH concentrations of the pregnant ewe and the maximal maternal GH concentrations occurred between 21.00 and 01.00h. Both the fetal and maternal plasma glucose concentrations showed a significant sinusoidal diurnal rhythm. The maximal maternal and fetal glucose concentrations were measured between 21.00 and 01.00h and between 23.00 and 03.00h respectively. We have therefore established that diurnal variations in plasma cortisol and prolactin concentrations exist prenatally. Whether the presence of such hormonal rhythms reflects the activity of an endogenous fetal circadian pacemaker remains to be established.

AB  - The developmental appearance and regulation of hypothalamic vasopressin (prepropressophysin) mRNA was studied using quantitated in situ hybridization techniques. Vasopressin mRNA levels in the supraoptic nuclei were reliably detected on day 16 of gestation, while mRNA in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) was detectable on day 21. These developmental patterns correlate well with the immunohistochemical appearance of prepropressophysin translation products previously reported in these nuclei. A prominent day-night rhythm of vasopressin mRNA levels was evident in the SCN on day 21 of gestation; the rhythm was also present on postnatal days 2 and 11. No such rhythm was present in the supraoptic nuclei at any developmental stage examined. These results demonstrate regulated expression of the vasopressin gene during fetal life. Vasopressin mRNA levels in the SCN are already under specific circadian control when the nuclei are morphologically immature and lacking many of the connections found in adult animals. © 1987 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The relationship between oral temperature taken at the time of admission and the duration of elapsed labor was evaluated. Onset of labor data revealed a diurnal distribution with an apogee at midnight to 2 AM and a nadir at 11 AM to noon. Temperature data ranged from 94.3° to 99.7° F (34.6° to 37.6° C). The mean temperature of 97.8° ± 0.8° F (36.6° ± 0.44° C) is significantly lower (p < 0.001) than the clinical reference temperature of 98.6° F (37.0° C). A likely explanation is the coincidental admission time (early to late morning) and the nadir of the diurnal variation in temperature. Linear regression fitted to the data (after deletion of six hypothermic outliers) yielded the relationship: temperature = 97.8° F + 0.0115 × duration of elapsed labor (temperature = 36.6° C + 0.0064 × duration of elapsed labor) for which the correlation coefficient is not statistically significant. © 1987, C.

AB  - The behaviour of lactating mice in their home cages was examined by ethological procedures at 1,7,14 and 21 days postpartum. Early in lactation, maternal behaviour was more frequent in the light phase of the 24 hr cycle, whereas non-social activity occupied a greater amount of time during the dark phase. As the pups became older, maternal behaviour declined, and at 21 days the dams showed a marked increase of solitary immobility. Behavioural alterations produced by the administration of sodium valproate at 600 mg/l as drinking fluid during pregnancy and lactation (group SVP), and during lactation only, (group PN) were assessed. (Intake of drug amounted to 153 mg/kg during gestation and 186 mg/kg in lactation). Dams of group PN showed behavioural differences from controls in late lactation, pup nursing being prolonged at day 14 postpartum and the frequency of all categories of active behaviour, other than nursing and nestbuilding, was increased at day 21 postpartum in the dark phase of their daily cycle. There was not significant effect on categories of behaviour in dams of the SVP group. Overall, sodium valproate, at this dose, did not reduce maternal care. © 1987.

AB  - The effect of reducing the dietary protein content at different stages of development was investigated. A group of control rats was fed a diet with 25% protein throughout the entire study. Four other groups were fed only 6% protein in a diet isocaloric with the control diet. In an "intrauterine"-deprivation (prenatal) group, the feeding of the low protein diet was limited to the span from mating to delivery. In a "postnatal"-deprivation (lactation) group, the reduced protein diet was limited to the 25 days allowed for lactation. In a "perinatal"-deprivation group, the low-protein diet was fed during both the pregnancy and the 25 days after birth. Protein deprivation in a "preperinatal" group started 1 month before mating and continued throughout gestation and lactation to day 25 after birth. Except for the perinatal group, consisting of two animals, other groups consisted each of three or four rats. Behavioral variables--activity, rest, eating, drinking, exploring, grooming, curling up, and lying down--were studied in rats from each group at 90 days of age for 3 days at consecutive near-12-min intervals for observation spans of 1 min. Two animals subjected to bilateral suprachiasmatic lesions, subsequently validated histologically, and two sham-operated controls were also investigated. Both the population-mean and the single cosinor methods were used for data analysis in conjunction with linear least-squares spectra. Cosinor methods allow the rejection of the zero-amplitude assumption on a group basis for the intact controls (P = 0.007), the intrauterine malnutrition group (P = 0.034), the lactation group (P = 0.059), the preperinatal group (P = 0.055), and on an individualized basis for the two animals constituting the perinatal group (P = 0.007 and 0.002). These results by population-mean cosinor are complemented by the single cosinor demonstration of rhythms for most animals and variables investigated. The results demonstrate, on an individualized basis, the persistence of circadian rhythms under differently timed conditions of protein malnutrition. The data on the behavior of rats with bilateral lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei show a circadian to ultradian variance transposition. In most behaviors, there are prominent ultradian rhythms, which, however, require study over longer spans with dense observations on additional animals.

AB  - Abstract To have deliveries occur during the daytime on weekdays, programmed induction of labor was attempted. Uncomplicated primiparous pregnant women were randomly divided into induced and non‐induced labor groups at the beginning of pregnancy. In the induced group, labor was induced by prostaglandin E2 oral tablet and prostaglandin F2α drip infusion when the prerequisites, (1) 38 weeks or more of pregnancy, (2) 32 cm or more of uterine fundal height, and (3) approximately 9 cm of biparietal diameter of the fetal head on the ultrasonography, were satisfied. Laminaria tents and/or a soft rubber metreurynter were applied to the unripe uterine cervix before induction of labor. In the induced group (n = 588), the rate of daytime delivery (09: 00–17: 00 h) was 80.4% and that of night delivery (00: 00–09: 00 h) was 3.2%. The duration of labor was significantly shorter in the induced group than in the non‐induced group. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the amount of intrapartum hemorrhage, cesarean section rate, infant birth weight, or one‐minute and five‐minute Apgar scores. © 1987 Japanese Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology

AB  - Insulin requirements are known to increase during pregnancy, but it has not been reported whether this relates to prandial or basal requirements, or to a change in insulin pharmacokinetics. In nine unselected pregnant patients the pattern of this increase was that of a large increase in the total morning dose and a reduction in the evening dose of intermediate acting insulin, in order to maintain good control while avoiding nocturnal hypoglycaemia. 24 h metabolic profiles were carried out in these patients in the third trimester of pregnancy. Plasma free insulin profiles reflected the dosage patterns and there was no change in insulin metabolic clearance rate in pregnancy. Pregnant diabetic patients had a broad peak of free insulin concentration around lunchtime followed by a steady fall until next morning. Blood lactate and alanine were higher than normal and 3-hydroxybutyrate lower than is usually seen in non-pregnant diabetic patients. The observations suggest that there may be differential changes in insulin sensitivity in diabetic pregnancy between the fed and fasting states, and that the therapeutic response to this causes a measurable metabolic change. © 1987 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

AB  - This work was designed to study nychthemeral variations of plasma corticosterone and aldosterone in captive female lizards Lacerta vivipara. In preliminary experiments, the possible alterations of plasma corticosteroids by various stress factors were researched. A prolonged blood sampling (up to 8 min) did not alter plasma corticosterone levels but a significant increase of plasma aldosterone levels was observed. Confinement (1 or 18 hr) in small individual cages before blood collection resulted in a significant increase of both corticosterone and aldosterone. Whatever the period investigated (vitellogenesis, gestation, 2 months after parturition), plasma corticosterone levels showed a unimodal daily rhythm correlated with the activity of the females in the laboratory. No shift of the peak was observed according to season but the mean minimal and maximal levels were lower during vitellogenesis than during the other periods tested. Nychthemeral variations of plasma aldosterone levels were similar to those of corticosterone but of lower amplitude. Adrenal response to a short confinement (less than 1 hr) before blood sampling varied during a 24-hr period (period tested: vitellogenesis). Only minimal levels of corticosteroids were significantly increased. The possible effects of a long duration of captivity under optimal thermal conditions are discussed. © 1987.

AB  - Two experiments were carried out with rats isolated at mating (Day 1 of gestation) and kept in a standard light regimen of 14 h light (14L:10D). All treatments started on Day 8 of gestation; periodicities of 23:45 h, 24:00 h and 24:15 h were applied to the light phase (14L) in Exp. I and to daily treatment with melatonin (0.3 mg/rat) or its vehicle in Exp. II. In Exp. II, the animals were placed in a continuous dim light regimen and injections were given at a time corresponding to lights off. In all groups, rats delivered on the afternoon of Day 22 and on the morning of Day 23 after a cessation of parturitions. The rates of births during these two times depended on the periodicities of the light phase or those of melatonin administration. With a periodicity of 24:15 h, 85.7% of rats in Exp. I and 85.7% of rats in Exp. II delivered on Day 22. With a periodicity of 23:45 h, 83.0% of births occurred on Day 23 in Exp. I and 57.7% in Exp. II with melatonin instead of 25.9% in the corresponding vehicle controls. These results suggest that melatonin secretion may be a mechanism whereby photoperiod regulates the time of parturition in the rat.

AB  - The effect of starvation, starvation and refeeding and feeding a low-protein diet on concentrations of the mRNAs for the alpha-, beta- and gamma-caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and whey acidic protein has been determined using dot-blot hybridization analyses with total RNA extracted from mammary acini isolated from lactating rats. Starvation for 48 h decreased the concentrations of all RNA species to between 5 and 20% of those for rats feeding ad libitum when expressed on a DNA basis. Refeeding for 24h restored the concentrations to control values. Consumption of a low protein diet reduced the concentrations of each mRNA by about 50%. Only minor changes were detected in the mRNA concentrations for alpha-casein, alpha-lactalbumin and whey acidic protein in samples prepared at six hourly intervals from rats receiving a restricted intake (40% ad libitum) of the control diet.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that convenience for the physician plays a role in the rate of cesarean section performed because of dystocia. Three time periods were defined (night, 12 midnight to 7:59 am; day, 8 am to 5:59 pm; evening, 6 pm to 11:59 pm) based on the work commitments and daily routines of the obstetrician. Rates of cesarean section for dystocia were determined for each of the three time periods. An evening peak in the cesarean section rate is partially but not entirely explained by an evening increase in the proportion of patients in prolonged labor. When patients were stratified according to labor duration (<12, 12 to 15, and >16 hours), a persistent evening excess in the rate of cesarean section for dystocia was observed for patients whose labor duration was <16 hours. Although this is interpreted as being consistent with the hypothesis of physician convenience, the magnitude of this effect on the overall rate of cesarean section for dystocia is small. © 1987.

AB  - Normal labor begins most frequently between midnight and 2 AM, presumably because of an unidentified circadian labor-activating mechanism. We used records of the Collaborative Perinatal Project to determine whether such a circadian mechanism is present with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) or preterm birth, and whether chorioamnionitis is associated with alternative patterns. In the absence of chorioamnionitis, both preterm births and term births with IUGR demonstrated nocturnal labor onset distributions like those of control term deliveries, which had a peak incidence at 1:45 AM and an amplitude of 35%. With chorioamnionitis, in contrast, there was a different circadian distribution of term labor onset hour, with a peak at 7:45 PM and a 32% amplitude. A similar trend was found among preterm births. These data suggest the presence of the normal nocturnal labor-activating mechanism in both growth-retarded term deliveries and a defined subset of preterm deliveries. Chorioamnionitis appears to be associated with a prominent, unidentified alternative laboractivating mechanism that is maximal in the evening. © 1987 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - It was investigated when diurnal and other variations in fetal movements and in heart rate pattern emerge during the course of pregnancy. Real-time ultrasound observations were made at 13 weeks of gestation in 7 nulliparous women and at 20-22 weeks in 10 nulliparous women. The observations took place at 0800, 1300 and 2200 and lasted 60 min/session at 13 weeks and 120 min at 20-22 weeks. The fetal heart rate was recorded for 24 h at 20-22 weeks using electrocardiographic electrodes. No diurnal variations were found for any of the movement patterns at 13 weeks. At 20-22 weeks, however, significant diurnal changes were observed in the total activity, the incidence of general movements and the breathing movements, with the lowest values in the morning and the highest during the evening. Fetal breathing movements already appeared to be related to maternal meals at 20-22 weeks as their incidence was significantly lower during the third hour after meals compared to the second hour. The rank order of the incidence of movements (from high to low incidence) was fairly constant over the course of the day both at 13 and at 20-22 weeks. This confirms earlier findings that the rank order of movements is strictly age dependent. Diurnal rhythms were observed for both the fetal heart rate and its variation. The fetal heart rate was lowest between 2400 and 0600 and the heart rate variation was lowest between 0600 and 1100. The incidence of accelerations and decelerations showed no systematic fluctuations over the 24-h period. Decelerations occurred more frequently than accelerations. Episodes of high heart rate variation were associated with an increased incidence of general movements. The various diurnal variations over 24 h at 20-22 weeks generally followed the same temporal sequence as those found near term, although the changes were considerably smaller. © 1987.

AB  - Maternal behavior of spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) normotensive rats was assessed over the preweanling period (days 1-21). Ten litters of each strain were observed during the dark phase of the light:dark cycle using a scan sampling technique. Cages were observed periodically throughout the day and the momentary behavior of the dam was recorded on a checklist of 9 different behaviors. These behaviors included: nursing entire litter, nursing part of litter, contact with entire litter, contact with part of litter, pup carrying/retrieval, licking pups, sniffing pups, nest building, and away from litter. A second set of ten litters per strain was observed in the same manner during the light phase of the light:dark cycle thus providing around the clock data throughout the entire preweanling period. For purposes of data analysis, the 21-day preweanling period was divided into 7 3-day blocks. The mean relative frequency with which each behavior was observed from SHR and WKY mothers was determined for each block and for each phase of the light:dark cycle separately. SHR mothers were with their pups and nursing them more frequently than WKY mothers during the light phase of the circadian cycle. Complimentary to this finding, WKY mothers were observed away from their pups more frequently than SHR mothers during both light and dark phases. Finally, SHR mothers were observed to lick their pups more often than WKY mothers during both phases of the light:dark cycle. These findings were consistent across the entire preweanling period. The results are discussed in terms of early environmental influences on the development of hypertension in the SHR rat. © 1987.

AB  - A highly circadian incidence of premature rupture of the fetal membranes was found in the Collaborative Perinatal Project data base. Among term deliveries without membranitis, the peak incidence of premature rupture of the membranes occurred at 3:00 AM, and the amplitude of a fitted sinusoid was 45%. Rupture hour was markedly influenced by latent interval and by membranitis. In the absence of membranitis, in term cases with a latent interval of less than three hours, rupture hour peaked at 2:00 AM, with an amplitude of 64%. Those with a latent interval of three to 35 hours peaked at 4:15 AM, with an amplitude of 37%. Those with 36 or more hours' latent interval showed little circadian variation. Preterm premature rupture of the membranes was also segregated into subgroups by latent interval. Preterm premature rupture of the membranes with a three- to 35-hour latent interval peaked at 4:00 AM, with an amplitude of 31%, similar to the corresponding term group. A circadian factor thus appears to cause most cases of premature rupture of the membranes in term and preterm births when membranitis is absent. The observed stratification by latent interval indicates that the mechanisms of premature rupture of the membranes may differ between the subgroups. With membranitis, the early-morning peak in premature rupture of the membranes was not statistically demonstrable in any of the term or preterm latent interval subgroups. This indicates that there may be unique rupture mechanisms associated with membranitis. The data in this study should assist efforts to classify premature rupture of the membranes and study its mechanisms. © 1987 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - A study of various physiological conditions, possibly influencing levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), is described. Atrial natriuretic peptide was determined by a radioimmunoassay, suitable for routine measurements, using 1 mL of human plasma. Atrial naturetic peptide was adsorbed onto Sep-pak C-18 cartridges, eluted with acidified ethanol and subsequently radioimmunoassayed. The detection limit was slightly less than 2 pg/tube (∼5 pg/mL plasma). Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 7 and 10%, respectively. Study of various sampling conditions revealed that blood sampling in EDTA-tubes kept on ice, and centrifuged within 1 h, gives the most reliable results. Reference values in 74 individuals ranged between 10 to 69 pg/mL (mean ± SD = 30± 11 pg/mL). We observed no difference in reference values when the blood sampling procedure was in the sitting (29 ± 11 pg/mL, n = 43) or supine (31 ± 12 pg/mL, n = 31) position. Venepuncture stress did not consistently change ANP-levels. No difference was observed in ANP between the follicular and the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. ANP levels of 7 ambulant female subjects declined significantly during the study period from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. © 1987, Association for Clinical Biochemistry. All rights reserved.

AB  - A method to calculate unbound cortisol from total Cortisol (measured by competitive protein binding) and CBG (measured by radial immunodiffusion) based on the binding equilibrium has been evaluated. The calculated results (y) correlate well with those (x) obtained by centrifugal ultrafiltration at 37°C (y = 1.04 x - 2.11 ng/ml; r = 0.975; n = 150). The concentration of CBG is similar in normal men (37.7 ± 3.5 (SD) μg/ml; n = 12) and women (39.5 ± 3.7 (SD) μg/ml; n = 7) and shows no diurnal variation, but marked diurnal variation is observed for total cortisol (193.7 ± 35.0 (SD) ng/ml at 08.00 h vs 43.2 ± 23.3 (SD) ng/ml at 22.00 h; n = 19) and particularly for unbound cortisol (16.5 ± 5.6 (SD) ng/ml at 08.00 h vs 2.3 ± 1.8 (SD) ng/ml at 22.00h; n = 19). The concentration of CBG (89.1 ± 11.2(SD) μg/ml) and of total cortisol (395.6 ± 103.3 (SD) ng/ml at 08.00 h; 110.3 ± 16.6 (SD) ng/ml at 22.00 h) are clearly elevated in estrogen treated women (n = 11) but unbound cortisol levels (17.2 ± 7.7 (SD) ng/ml at 08.00 h; 2.5 ± 0.5 (SD) ng/ml at 22.00h) are similar to the control group. The concentration of CBG is significantly decreased in patients with Cushing's syndrome (33.2 ± 5.6 μg/ml; n = 17) and unbound cortisol is relatively more elevated than total cortisol in these patients. In adrenal insufficiently CBG is normal, but total and unbound cortisol are markedly decreased. There is a significant decrease of CBG in hyperthyroidism (35.7 ± 5.5 μg/ml; n = 22), in cirrhosis (32.0 ± 8.0 μg/ml; n = 14) and in renal disease and a significant increase in patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (47.5 ± 6.3 μg/ml; n = 14), but total and unbound cortisol are normal in all these conditions. We conclude that unbound cortisol can be calculated in a simple and reliable way from total cortisol and CBG and permits a better evaluation of adrenal function, particularly in patients with altered CBG concentrations. © 1987.

AB  - Coordinated behavior states with concomitant variation in cyclic patterns of heart rate and of eye and gross body movements are present in the near term fetus. As in the newborn infant, there is conflicting evidence concerning their relationship at earlier gestationa ages. In the present study 120-min recordings were made of fetal heart rate, eye, and gross body movements in 11 healthy nulliparous women who were 30 to 32 wk pregnant. From the presented data it is concluded that at this gestational age heart rate variation and eye and gross body movements are not independant variables and that coordination among the cyclic patterns of these variables starts well before 36 wk.

AB  - Fetal behavior was studied after intravenous administration of either 0.4 mg of naloxone or an equal volume of saline solution in 54 healthy pregnant women near term. The number, duration, and amplitude of fetal heart rate accelerations increased after naloxone injection. The incidence of both gross fetal body movements and fetal breathing movements increased, especially in the first hour after naloxone administration. The distribution of fetal behavioral states was modified with a prevalence of active sleep and active awake states compared to the quiet sleep state. These data suggest that endorphins could be invo'ved in the modulation of fetal behavior. © 1987.

AB  - The authors examined 52 women with recurrent depression to determine the differences between women with and without histories of pregnancy-related affective episodes. The women with histories of such episodes (N = 24) had been significantly younger at illness onset, were more severely depressed at baseline, and tended to show less emotional stability. The EEG-recorded sleep of the women with pregnancy-related affective episodes was distinguished by longer REM sleep time and more REM activity, differences accounted for almost entirely by the women with histories of only postpartum episodes.

AB  - Two hundred women were interviewed within 24-36 hours after giving birth. The patients were not examined. It was found that 56% of the patients suffered from low-back pain during pregnancy. The percentage of Caucasians was statistically higher in the back pain group. The percentage of Hispanics was statistically higher in the no pain group. Among the variables that were compared in both groups were the age, the weight gained by the mothers during pregnancy, the baby’s weight, the number of previous pregnancies, number of prior children. None of the variables reached a statistically significant level. The pain group complained of pain in the low-back area, which radiated in 45.5% of cases to the lower extremities. In about one-third of the patients the pain increased as the day wore on, whereas in another one-third the pain increased during the night and disturbed sleep. Standing, sitting, forward bending, lifting, and walking tended to increase the pain. Most of the patients started suffering from back pain between the fifth and seventh months of pregnancy. Several theories to explain the occurrence of backache during pregnancy are discussed. © Lippincott-Raven Publishers.

AB  - Genetic differences in susceptibility to fetal alcohol effects (FAE) have been suggested by both human and animal studies. The Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mouse lines, selectively bred for differences in ethanol-induced narcosis, provide a model for studying differential alcohol sensitivity in the etiology of FAE. LS and SS mice were intubated with either 2.9 g/kg (20% w/v) ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of sucrose (S) twice per day (6 hr apart) on Days 7 through 15 of pregnancy. An untreated control group (C) was maintained for each line. Offspring were fostered to lactating Rockland-Swiss mice at birth. LS offspring prenatally exposed to ethanol exhibited increased open-field activity relative to LS controls, but this effect was due to the overactivity of one litter. Activity for SS mice prenatally exposed to ethanol did not differ from control levels. Ethanol content in blood (280 mg/dl), amniotic fluid (258 mg/dl), and fetal tissue (230 mg/dl) did not differ in similary treated LS and SS dams. In a second experiment, females were treated from Days 7 through 18 of gestation, and their offspring were tested for either open-field activity or passive avoidance learning. There were no group differences in open-field activity, but LS mice prenatally exposed to alcohol took more trials to reach a passive avoidance criterion than their controls, whereas similarly treated SS mice did not differ from controls. These results suggest that genetically-mediated sensitivity to ethanol influences susceptibility to FAE and that this may be task specific. © 1987.

AB  - Summary. The relation between the blood flow velocity waveform in the fetal internal carotid artery (n= 12) and umbilical artery (n= 15) and fetal behavioural states at 37–38 weeks of gestation was studied. In the fetal internal carotid artery, under standardized fetal heart rate conditions, the pulsatility index (PI), as a measure of peripheral vascular resistance, was significantly lower during behavioural state 2F (active sleep) compared with state 1F (quiet sleep) according to the classification by Nijhuis et al. (1982), suggesting increased fetal cerebral blood flow during state 2F. In the umbilical artery, no significant difference in PI between the two behavioural states could be established. This suggests a fetal origin of the state dependency observed in fetal blood flow velocity waveforms. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Twenty-five pregnant women between 36 and 40 weeks' gestational age were studied to examine effects of a 5-second external vibratory acoustic stimulus on the fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variability. Where was an immediate significant increase in the basal heart rate, which persisted for 1 hour after the stimulus, compared to that of the control subjects. There was also a significant increase in the total time during which accelerations occurred for the first 20 minutes after the stimulus. There were no changes in computer-derived indices of fetal heart rate variability. Maternal blood pressure and heart rate were not altered following vibratory acoustic stimulus. We hypothesize that external vibratory acoustic stimulus causes a change from a state of sleep to a state of wakefulness in near term healthy fetuses. © 1987.

AB  - Sleep disturbances of infancy (troubles in falling asleep, in the duration of sleep, night waking) are now the subject of renewed interest. Recently, these sleep problems in babies and young children seem to have increased in frequency and severity. A pilot study of sleep disorders is underway at the child department of the Hopital de la Poterne des Peupliers and involves more than 80 children aged 0–18 months. Twenty‐nine infants have been selected from this cohort with severe and persistent sleep disorders that began in the first 18 months of life. In the absence of a control group, all cases were selected carefully. Some of the characteristics of these children are discussed: Age, sex, associated troubles, modalities of soothing, effect of hypnotic drugs, development under treatment. Some of these children are noted to be very active. Quite often, the pregnancy was marked by a traumatic event or by depression or anxiety in the mother. During evaluation of the mother‐child interaction, one often notes a withdrawal of the mother's cathexis toward her child, which can go along with hyperstimulation in the relationship. This withdrawal concerns the emotional and fantasied dimensions of the interaction. The child's reactions and initiatives can be paralleled with the mother's speech, motor, and emotional attitudes. Thus, sleep disorders in early childhood represent an opportunity to observe the modalities of emotional exchange between mother and child and a methodologically interesting situation for the assessment of mother‐child relationships.

AB  - A regular count of perceived fetal movements by the mother has been proposed as a screening method for the early recognition of fetal distress. Absence or a strongly decreased number of fetal movements during a particular period is considered as a sign of fetal distress. In the study presented, the optimal duration of a recording period for the maternal perception of fetal movements was examined. 186 pregnant patients at gestational ages of 32 and 38 weeks were asked to mark each perceived fetal movement on a time axis for two continuous hours. From these patients an 'optimal' group of 143 pregnancies was selected to constitute the study group. A window technique was applied to the 2 h recordings, searching for periods in which 0, 1 or 2 fetal movements were noted. 23% of the recordings at 32 weeks and 14% at 38 weeks showed absence of fetal movements for at least 30 min. At both 32 weeks and 38 weeks there was absence of fetal movements for more than 1 h in only 1.5% of the recordings. The findings are in agreement with the fetal behavioural state concept. A recording time of 1 h exceeds the normal duration of a fetal quiet-sleep state and minimizes the risk of unjustified suspicion of fetal distress. © 1987.

AB  - A two-group design was used to compare the state behavior of newborns who roomed-in with their mothers at night with those who were cared for by the traditional nursery-at-night method. Twenty-one full-term, low-risk newborns comprised the study sample. Data were collected using a sleep monitor bassinet for two consecutive nights after delivery. Comparison of the nursery environment with the mother’s postpartum room at night revealed greater light and sound levels in the nursery setting. Regarding caregiving practices, rooming-in infants received more contact with the caregiver and care that was more often related to their state behavior. Infants in the mother’s room had significantly, p <.001, more quiet sleep (33 % vs. 25.4 %), less indeterminate (4.8 % vs. 11.2 %), and less crying (0.6 % vs. 7.5 %) states than infants who remained in the nursery. © Lippincott-Raven Publishers.

AB  - Neurotransmitters are present at very early stages of brain development. They may have trophic effects on maturation of target neurons and mediate the behavioral repertoire of the immature brain. Many centrally acting drugs which are used during pregnancy and early childhood for the treatment of e.g. hypertension, depression, epilepsy, sleep disorders, or hyperkinetism influence brain neurotransmitters and behavioral states. Disturbances observed later in life in animal and man, due to perinatal interference of such drugs with brain neurotransmitters and behavioral states, are not gross physical malformations but rather subtle behavioral and neurological symptoms such as hyperactivity, emotional lability, perceptual motor disturbances, attentional distractibility and sleep disturbances.

AB  - Residency programs are often described as highly stressful environments. Studies of the stresses during the graduate medical training years have focused on identifying specific problems caused by the professional environment, such as lack of leisure time, feelings of ambiguity about professional and personal roles, feelings of inadequacy, and sleep deprivation (1,2). In addition to work-related stress, people experience life events e.g. marriage, pregnancy, retirement which necessitate adaptation by the individual (3). Life events have been identified by Holmes and Rahe (4) as stressors that frequently require social readjustment. Whether the stresses during medical training are solely attributable to the work setting or are also related to life events has not been addressed in the literature. © 1990 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - The total impact of the menopause on the health of women and the ultimatebenefit/risk ratio of oestrogen replacement therapy are yet to be defined completely. Until these are accomplished, broad general guidelines for the use of oestrogen replacement therapy in all patients cannot be given. Treatment should be individualized to the patient's specific needs. Use of appropriate dosages of oestrogen in combination with progestin administration should reduce risk and enhance benefits for those subjects requiring its use. The development of new non-oral methods of administration should also help. © 1987 Baillière Tindall.

AB  - Maternal and neonatal growth, behavior, and physiologic organization were evaluated in 104 mother-infant pairs with positive results of urine toxicology screens. ANOVA comparison of cocaine, methamphetamine, and cocaine plus methamphetamine groups revealed no significant differences in perinatal variables. The Finnegan withdrawal scoring scheme demonstrated that all three groups of infants had altered neonatal behavioral patterns, characterized by abnormal sleep patterns, poor feeding, tremors, and hypertonia. Infants exposed to cocaine or methamphetamine or both were combined and compared with both narcotic-exposed and drug-free mother-infant pairs matched for known maternal risk factors. All drug-exposed groups had significantly higher rates of prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation and smaller head circumferences than did the drug-free comparison group. A significantly higher rate of placental hemorrhage occurred in the cocaine plus methamphetamine group. Stepwise multiple regression analysis assessed the independent contribution of maternal factors; cocaine or methamphetamine was adversely, negatively assoclated with gestational age, birth weight, length, and occipitofrontal circumference. The increased rate of prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and perinatal complications associated with perinatal exposure to cocaine or methamphetamine was greater than that predicted by coexisting risk factors and was consistent with the pharmacologic properties of these drugs. © 1987 The C.

AB  - ABSTRACT. The aim of this study was to illuminate the interaction between mother and infant in the condition of infantile colic and compare this with the interaction in a non‐colic group. Infantile colic was defined as daily inconsolable crying. The sample, 21 mother—infant dyads, were recruited from six welfare centres in the north‐west (a middle‐class area) of Stockholm, A non‐colic group, ten mother—infant dyads, were used as control group. The methods used were observing the feeding situation, interviewing the mother about pregnancy, labour and delivery, mother's first contact with the newborn, maternity stay, duration of breastfeeding, the infant's crying and medication, mother's food habits, etc. The mother was then asked to fill in a Sleep/Activity Scale for the seven following days and nights. A questionnaire was sent six months post‐partum to follow up the situation. Labour and delivery was a positive event for most of the mothers and all the fathers had taken part in it. The observations showed a tendency of disturbed mother—infant interaction during feeding. When the infant was crying it was usually the mother who took care and also developed several ways to try to console the infant. 1987 Nordic College of Caring Science (NCCS)

AB  - Summary Summary Twenty‐five normal newborns aged between 3 and 6 days had their movements recorded by (a) clinical observation in a controlled environment, (b) chart recording from an automatic movement mattress over 4 hours, and (c) cine photography triggered by the movement mattress. Over 80 different individual types of movement were grouped into six categories: (a) progression movements (obligatory reciprocal movements), (b) symmetrical movements (slower flexion or extension movements), (c) startle movements, (d) asymmetrical tonic neck reflex and ‘Moro’, (e) facial movements and (f) athetoid movements. The normal newborn's motor activity is significantly related to the level of arousal, gestational age, and environmental variables sueh as position, temperature, light and noise.

AB  - Women from a health maintenance organization who chose early postpartum discharge from the hospital were compared with women who chose a traditional stay. Subjects were mailed a questionaire; 84% (n=183) were returned. The survey instrument was designed to measure demographic, family, and birth-related characteristics; postpartum values and beliefs; early discharge program awareness; and postpartum care satisfaction. Findings revealed that the early discharge group had fewer primiparas, more rooming-in mothers, more bottle-feeding mothers, more deliveries between midnight and 6:00 AM, more deliveries at one hospital, more mothers who relied on themselves rather than others for their discharge decision, and more mothers who learned about early discharge from printed information rather than from clinic staff. Mothers in the late discharge group placed more value on rest and sleep, a quiet atmosphere, attention from others, and having a knowledgeable person available. Implications for hospitals and staff education are discussed in light of complete study findings.

AB  - Aminophylline, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, has for many years been used to relieve bronchospasm. Recent reports have shown that aminophylline antagonizes morphine and diazepam sedation. To see if aminophylline acts similarly on barbiturate sedation, we examined 24 women undergoing short general anaesthesia with thiopental (7 mg · kg‐1), using a double‐blind study design. Evaluated by continuous auditory reaction time measurements, aminophylline (5.6 mg · kg‐1) reduces the depth and duration of sedation with thiopental. This suggests that aminophylline could be used to diminish an unwanted effect of barbiturate sedation. © 1987 Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Fonden

AB  - This study analyzes “microsystem” variables that are associated with stress in the lives of 191 North African low SES immigrant families. Four domains of potential stress factors were analyzed for 36 overwhelmed mothers compared to the 155 non-overwhelmed mothers: (1) ecological stressors (lack of toilet bath, etc.; overcrowded apartment; more than three children); (2) medical stressors (difficult pregnancy or delivery; frequent maternal or child illnes); (3) interpersonal problems (father or mother reports major problems in relationship with toddler; father feels overwhelmed); (4) child behavior stressors (retarded language; sleep or feeding difficulties; severe behavior problems). Few ecological or medical stressors differentiated overwhelmed from non-overwhelmed mothers. However, in the families of the overwhelmed mothers the following factors were significantly more frequent: Poor father-child relationship; severe toddler behavior problems; and father feeling overwhelmed. The importance of interpersonal stressors can alert preventive workers to the need for parenting supports as well as medical and housing help for immigrant families. © Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, Inc., 1987

AB  - Abstract: EEG examinations were carried out on 137 patients with thalidomide embryopathy aged between 7 and 22 with a mean age of 17.0. Waking and sleep EEGs were normal in 82 (59.9%), and abnormal in 55 (40.1%). The incidence of abnormal EEG was significantly high in the patients associated with mental retardation, and it increased in proportion to the severity of mental retardation. The most frequent abnormal EEG finding was slowing of the basic activity (35/137; 24.8%).The incidence of slowing was significantly higher in the patients with a sensorineural hearing impairment (26/74; 35.1%) than in those with dysmelia (9/62; 14.5%). Slowing appeared frequently in the patients with various cranial nerve symptoms (30/84; 35.7%). Theincidence of slowing was found significantly high in the patients with borderline or subnormal intelligence (8/16; 50.0%), and it correlated with the severity of mental retardation. Many patients (48/84; 57.1%) showed unilateral or asymmetrical neurological symptoms. However, asymmetry or focal abnormality in EEG was shown in only 8 patients. Positive spikes appeared frequently in the patients with gonadal dysplasia. Other somatic symptoms, past medical history and family history were not related to the incidence of abnormal EEGs. Eight patients had had epileptic seizures prior to this examination. Another 2 patients had noctural enuresis and showed epileptic EEG abnormalities in this examination. The incidence of epilepsy was significantly higher in the patients we examined than among the general population. It is concluded that ingestion of thalidomide during pregnancy affected not only the morphological development of the limbs of the fetus, but the functions of its central nervoussystem, causing hearing impairment, other cranial nerve symptoms, mental retardation or epilepsy.

AB  - Pre-term neonates are at increased risk for neurological dysfunction. Several investigators have found scalp recorded somatosensory evoked potential studies (SSEPs) after median nerve stimulation useful in the evaluation of newborn infants with asphyxiation and the effects of other adverse prenatal and perinatal factors. In order to evaluate the entire developing neuraxis, we undertook SSEPs after tibial nerve stimulation (PTN-SSEP) in pre-term neonates. Using bilateral simultaneous stimulation, potentials were recorded from the following sites: PF-spT6 (N5), spL1-spT6 (N16), spC7-Fpz (N27), Cz′ (1 cm behind the vertex)-Fpz (P55). In all newborns studied, the N5 and N16 were reliably recorded. The N5 appeared relatively independent of the length of the newborns. The N16 correlated inversely with length. The N27 and P55 were recorded in 52% and 65% of the newborns, respectively. N27 inversely correlated modestly with length. The P55 was independent of most factors and probably reflects variable rates of cerebral myelination, neuronogenesis, varying states of alertness, and possibly subclinical encephalopathies. These results demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining such data in pre-term newborns. © 1987.

AB  - Duration of analgesia and side effects following single bolus doses of epidural fentanyl (100 μg) or sufentanil (10, 20, 30 or 50 μg) were studied in 50 patients who underwent Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia. Fewer patients experienced pain peroperatively in the fentanyl group than in a joint group of those given sufentanil 20 or 30 μg (p < 0.05). The combined fentanyl and sufentanil 50 μg groups had fewer patients in pain than the sufentanil 10 μg group at 3 hours after injection (p < 0.05). Patients given fentanyl also had a longer pain‐free interval than those who received sufentanil 10 μg (p < 0.02). The sufentanil 50 μg group had more patients asleep than the 10 μg group and also had more patients with pruritus than the 10 μg or 30 μg groups (p < 0.02). The patients given sufentanil 30 and 50 μg had more emetic sequelae than those who received sufentanil 10 and 20 μg or fentanyl 100 μg (p < 0.05). There was no detectable excretion of drug into breast milk and no significant respiratory depression at the time of first postoperative analgesia in the patients who received fentanyl or 30 μg or less of sufentanil.

AB  - The differences between parental grief reactions following different types of infant losses were investigated. A total of 117 parents (55 couples) from three groups of parents (stillbirth, neonatal death and Sudden Infant Death), 53% women and 47% men, answered a survey on different grief reactions one to four years following the death. Included in the survey were psychometric measures relating to anxiety, depression, impact of event, bodily discomfort, and general wellbeing. The results demonstrated that the three groups differed in their experience of various grief reactions. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) parents reported significantly more anxiety and intrusive thoughts than the other two groups in the early post‐loss period, as well as significantly more anger, restlessness, and sleep disturbances than the neonatal group. The SIDS parents also scored significantly higher on some of the measures (experience of recovery, IES intrusion) relating to how they felt at the time of study. While the death being sudden did not show any correlation with the parents experience of recovery or the psychometric measures, the length of time the child had lived showed a strong relationship to these measures. It is emphasized that counselling to parents must be based on increased knowledge about parental reactions, tailored to the individual family's needs. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - A vasovasostomy may be performed on an outpatient basis with local anesthesia, but also may be performed on an outpatient basis with epidural or general anesthesia. Local anesthesia is preferred by most of my patients, the majority of whom choose this technique. With proper preoperative and intraoperative sedation, patients sleep lightly through most of the procedure. Because of the length of time often required for bilateral microsurgical vasoepididymostomy, epidural or general anesthesia and overnight hospitalization are usually necessary. Factors influencing the preoperative choice for vasovasostomy or vasoepididymostomy in patients undergoing vasectomy reversal are considered. The preoperative planned choice of vasovasostomy or vasoepididymostomy for patients having vasectomy reversal described herein does not have the support of all urologists who regularly perform these procedures. My present approach has evolved as the data reported in Tables 1 and 2 have become available, but it may change as new information is evaluated. However, it offers a logical method for planning choices of anesthesia and inpatient or outpatient status for patients undergoing vasectomy reversal procedures.
The basis for choosing either vasovasostomy or vasoepididymostomy for reversal of vasectomy or vas obstruction by microsurgical outpatient procedures, and management of these patients, are summarized, with diagrams and photographs included. Prior to surgery, it is impossible to determine whether a person needs one procedure or the other. When operative procedures have begun, those with sperm or clear vas fluid are candidates for vasovasostomy. Those without sperm, or with cloudy fluid, will require vasoepididymostomy under general or epidural anesthesia, which takes 4-6 hr. No extensive data on outcome of pregnancy after microsurgical vasoepididymostomy are available. The author's patients with outpatient 2-layer microsurgical vasovasostomy have had 62% pregnancy rate so far; 14% more men show normal mobile sperm counts. Most of the operations are done under local anesthesia using lidocaine and bupivacaine, perhaps with sedation, through a 2-3 cm incision. Only general instructions for the 2 procedures are included here. The author prefers "end-to-side" microsurgical vasoepididymostomy, combined with 1 or more microdissections to find the most caudal area of the epididymis where mobile sperm are present. For those who must contain costs, as these operations are not usually covered by health insurance, the postoperative recovery, if needed, is obtained by hospitalizing the patient overnight after the procedure. Costs of vasovasostomy, not including surgeon's fee, ranged from $1144 for local, outpatient, to $2066 for general anesthesia and inpatient care.

AB  - During late fetal and early neonatal life, the maternal circadian system coordinates the timing of a circadian clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) to the prevailing light-dark cycle. The role of the maternal SCN in the process of maternal coordination was investigated in rats. Complete lesions of the maternal SCN on day 7 of gestation disrupted rhythms of SCN glucose utilization in fetuses and pineal N-acetyltransferase activity in 10-d-old pups. This disruption was probably due to the desynchronization of individually oscillating fetal SCN, because individual pups born to and reared by SCN-lesioned dams under constant conditions exhibited normal circadian rhythms in drinking behavior. Cross-foster studies showed that the maternal circadian system can coordinate developing circadian rhythmicity during either the pre- or postnatal period. The results indicate that the maternal SCN are a necessary component of the mechanism of maternal coordination during both the pre- and postnatal periods.

AB  - Clinical apnoea in infants is defined as a pause in breathing of more than 20 s duration or a briefer pause associated with bradycardia. Such events are uncommon in term infants and usually are due to some precipitating factor. They occur more commonly in preterm infants and there is an exponential increase in incidence with decreasing gestational age at birth. Although insults such as infection or hypoxia can accentuate the problem, the major factor appears to be immaturity. Studies of brain-stem maturity using auditory evoked responses indicate that infants with immature responses have a higher incidence of apnoea. Brain-stem immaturity has also been implicated in histopathological studies of infants dying from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). In preterm infants, upper airway obstruction occurs commonly at the end of longer events and some infants have a predominantly obstructive pattern. These latter infants are often neurologically abnormal and have had prolonged endotracheal intubation. Both of these factors could be associated with disordered control of upper airway patency. This notion is supported by the finding of upper airway instability during nasal occlusion in these infants. A link with SIDS is uncertain, although preterm infants with chronic pulmonary insufficiency, usually following a prolonged intubation, are said to be at particularly high risk of dying suddenly and unexpectedly during infancy.

AB  - Metoclopramide has wide applications in both clinical and experimental medicine. It is useful in the management of gastro-oesophageal reflux and gastric stasis. It is being used increasingly in the management of nausea and vomiting, and at high doses will significantly relieve the emesis that is induced by cytotoxic agents. Metoclopramide also has an important place in the investigation of the role of dopamine in physiological and pathological processes.

AB  - The effects of opiate receptor antagonism by naltrexone hydrochloride on the biphasic hypoxic ventilatory response in the infant Macaca nemestrina have been investigated. Minute ventilation, tidal volume, and respiratory frequency were measured in six animals from timed gestations before and during inhalation of a hypoxic gas mixture. All studies were completed in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. Arterial blood gases were obtained during each stimulus period. All animals demonstrated the typical biphasic ventilatory response to acute moderate-severe hypoxemia. After the administration of naltrexone hydrochloride to block opiate receptors, the animals still manifested a biphasic hypoxic response that was no different than that noted prior to drug administration. Naltrexone hydrochloride had no effect on room air resting ventilation in any of the animals. Our data suggest that endogenous opiates play no physiological role in the acute ventilatory response to moderate-severe hypoxia in the newborn subhuman primate.

AB  - In Switzerland like in most developed countries, the number of births is strongly related to the hour of the day and the day of the week: this pattern is very probably related to the current practice in obstetrics. Less expected is the fact that the perinatal mortality shows a striking circardian rythm according to the hour of birth. The paper presents this pattern and comments some related issues. © 1986 Schweiz Gesellschaft für Sozial- und Präventivmedizin.

AB  - The human prolactin molecule has been isolated and its structure characterized. This anterior pituitary hormone plays an important function in the induction and maintenance of lactation in the post-partum nursing mother. Prolactin-producing tumors cause inappropriate lactation in the nonpregnant woman. Bromocriptine, an ergot derivative, mimics the action of dopamine in the anterior pituitary gland and does not cure the underlying pathology. Prior to the development of bromocriptine, there was no effective treatment for the symptoms of amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Although the methods of therapy are more sophisticated today, there remain a number of unanswered questions. The unknown long-term risks of bromocriptine therapy must be balanced against the potential risk of osteopenia. © 1986.

AB  - In sixty healthy newborn infants the relations between the neonatal heart rate variability (NHRV) and the behavioral state were investigated. The infants were divided to subsequent two subgroups according to the mode of delivery. One was normal vaginal delivery (N = 47), and the other was elective cesarean section (N = 13). R-R intervals less than 280 msec and more than 700 msec were excluded. The maximum difference in successive R-R intervals accepted was 60 msec. The standard deviation of R-R intervals as LTV index and the mean of absolute beat to beat difference as STV index were calculated with a minicomputer. The behavioral states were classified according to Prechtl's criteria. The LTV in state 2 and state 4 increased progressively and reached its maximum level on the third day after birth. The change of STV was neither consistent nor significant. In state 5, both the STV and the LTV were very low. The discriminant function gave percentages of correct classification of 85-100% for the active quiet states. The NHRV was similar in state 1 and state 3, and in state 2 and state 4 respectively. There was an increase in the LTV during the 24 hours after birth in the CS group. Thus, neonatal adaptation of CS differs from that of normal labor.

AB  - Previously we have demonstrated the presence of AVT in the blood of fetal sheep. The source is not clear, but AVT has been identified in fetal pineal and pituitary glands. In view of the circadian secretory pattern of the pineal gland, we questioned whether fetal plasma AVT levels might vary diurnally. Plasma samples from five chronically catheterized ovine maternal ewes and fetal lambs 129-135 days' gestation were obtained at 3-19 hourly intervals for 1-2 days (mean ± S.E.M. = 35 ± 6 hours). Plasma AVT levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Results were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting procedures to relate hormone levels with time of day. Plasma AVT values for maternal ewes did not vary during the day in response to light/dark periods. The curve for mean fetal plasma AVT plotted against time showed oscillations with a period of about 25 hours (p<0.05). Peak fetal AVT levels were observed at 1600 hours and minimal levels at 0400 hours. These results indicate that ovine fetal AVT secretion varies diurnally. The site of AVT secretion may be the pineal gland; however, confirmation of this and identification of the physiological stimuli for secretion of fetal plasma AVT require further information. © 1986.

AB  - Rats mated under normal lighting conditions of a 24 h day were transferred to a sound‐proof room with period lengths (T) of 24 h (12 h light and 12 h dark, 12L:12D), or 22 h (11L:11D). During the first 15 d of pregnancy the rats were kept together in a large enclosure and the locomotor activity of the group was recorded. From day 15 they were kept separately, in cages, and from day 21 the number of litters born was noted every 3 h. On 12L:12D, rats displayed well defined periods of activity which were closely related to photoperiod. Mean activity was greatest in the dark, and overall activity declined after day 13 of gestation. On 11L:11D, coupling of locomotor activity to the dark phase was retained initially, but was not sustained throughout the period of study. Activity in the light was comparable to that in the dark at the time when the light:dark cycles of 11L:11D became reversed relative to those of 12L:12D. Rats on a 24 h day had a peak time of delivery at 519 h after mating (21·6 cycles of 12L:12D) and those on a 22 h day at 527 h (24·0 cycles of 11L:11D; difference, P 〈 0·002). The 11L:11D cycle therefore increased rather than decreased the duration of pregnancy, implying that elapsed time rather than the number of light:dark cycles experienced has the greater influence on the length of gestation. Of the animals on a 24 h day 76% had their litters in the light phase of the cycle, whereas only 36% of those on a 22 h day gave birth in the light (P 〈 0·02). © 1986 The Physiological Society

AB  - Ultrasonography enables measurements of size, shape, dynamic movement of the fetal body, heart and lungs. Also, the combination of two dimensional mapping of the fetus and Doppler ultrasound techniques has enabled measurement of blood flow velocities in the major fetal and uterine vessels. These techniques thus complement our view of the fetus and such observations enable diagnosis of some aspects of fetal health, and lead to the possibility of fetal surgery prior to birth in selected cases. Instrumentation of fetal animals in utero and measurement of their physiological function of the last trimester has led to new concepts of fetal sleep, breathing before birth, and the control of cardiac function. Thus a scientific basis for consideration of those factors which influence fetal growth and development is being established.

AB  - The maternal circadian system coordinates the timing of the fetal circadian clock to the prevailing light-dark cycle. The role of various maternal endocrine organs as the source of a coordinating signal was investigated in rats. Either metabolic activity of the fetal suprachiasmatic nuclei or pineal N-acetyltransferase activity in 10-day-old pups was used to monitor the fetal circadian clock. Extirpations of the maternal pituitary, adrenals, thyroid-parathyroids, ovaries, or pineal (each performed in separate experiments) did not abolish maternal coordination. © 1986 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The effect of type I and II diabetes in pregnancy on the circadian rhythm and diurnal excursion of plasma cortisol was studied in the second and third trimesters and post partum. Cosignor analysis demonstrated persistence during gestation of the significant circadian rhythm of the nonpregnant state. As previously reported in control pregnancies, plasma cortisol levels (24-hour mean, nadir, peak, and nadir-peak excursion) increased during gestation while the relative excursion of cortisol (expressed as the percent deviation from the 24-hour mean) was blunted. No significant difference was found between diabetic groups or when diabetic groups were compared with control subjects. Nocturnal hypoglycemia was common among diabetic during pregnancy and post partum. Although these episodes were usually asymptomatic, the mean concomitant cortisol levels were increased over the corresponding cortisol levels of nonhypoglycemic diabetic and control subjects. We conclude that differences between control and type I and II diabetic subjects in carbohydrate tolerance or glycemic excursion are not explained by differences in cortisol levels or rhythm. The pregnancy-ssociated blunting of the excursion of cortisol is consistent with an autonomous source of adrenocorticotropin. Asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia is common in insulin-equiring diabetic women and is associated with increased cortisol secretion. © 1986.

AB  - In order to verify whether fetal and maternal adrenal gland suppression induces effects on fetal behaviour, triamcinolone was administered to five healthy pregnant women at 35 weeks of gestation. Five patients of the same gestational age were used as control. Fetal heart rate (FHR) and fetal movements were recorded continuously over 2‐h interval by means of cardiotocography. After 3 weeks (38 weeks of gestation) the recordings were repeated without drug administration. Cortisol, adrenocorticotropin hormone, 17 β‐estradiol and unconjugated estriol were measured at the same time every 2 h in maternal peripheral plasma. At 35 weeks we found a loss of circadian rhythms of the hormones investigated and modifications of ultradian and circadian patterns of FHR in the treated group with respect to the control. No differences in hormonal and biophysical parameters were found between the two groups after the end of treatment (38 weeks). These data suggest that the inhibition of fetal and maternal adrenal glands could cause modifications of FHR patterns. Copyright © 1986 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Mother-pups interaction is essential for the normal development of individuals during ontogeny. In this review, the emphasis was on a special function in a special stage of development, i.e., fetal entrainment to pregnant mother of the circadian rhythm which is one of the fundamental autonomic functions in the organism. To this end, the basic assumptions and problems were introduced and the validity of the assumption was defended. Based on this, the various factors of postnatal life which might affect the phase angle of overt hormone rhythm were experimentally evaluated. Finally, by introducing experimental designs which were to exclude disturbing effects of the nursing mother, we found that the fetal oscillation was possibly entrainable by pregnant mother as early as in the middle of gestation. Possible mechanism of the entrainment and adaptive implications of the findings were discussed. © 1986, PHYSIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on pituitary‐adrenal function in adult offspring was assessed by measuring cortjcosterone (CS) levels in plasma following exposure to two forms of footshock stress, intermittent and continuous, and after administration of 20 mg/kg of morphine. The footshock experiments were conducted at two time points in the circadian pituitary‐adrenal cycle. Prenatally ethanol‐exposed (E) rats had higher levels of CS than pair‐fed and normal controls following intermittent footshock when tested at the crest of the CS circadian rhythm. However, this difference was not present when intermittent footshock was presented at the trough of the circadian cycle. At either time of day, there were no differences among the prenatal treatment groups in the basal condition or following continuous footshock. In addition, E rats had significantly higher levels of plasma CS than controls following morphine. Plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) levels were measured after intermittent footshock at the crest of the circadian rhythm and were significantly higher in E rats than in controls. These results extend our previous reports of enhanced activation of the hypothalamo‐pituitary‐adrenal axis in response to other stressors as wed as to ethanol in adult rats exposed to ethanol in utero. They also confirm that E rats are differentially hyperresponsive only to intermittent footshock stress, not to continuous footshock, as we had found to be the case when the analgesia induced by these two stressors was the dependent measure.

AB  - A male infant was born to a mother who had been suffering from primary hyperaldosteronism with the administration of alpha-methyldopa (MD) during pregnancy. His behavioral development, especially that of sleep, was studied by means of sleep-awake rhythm and polysomnography recordings (PSG) from 2 months to 2 years and 5 months of age. His daily sleep-awake rhythm showed some abnormal pattern. As to the PSG, the proportion of each sleep stage was normal and the two types of body movements (BM) showed various patterns. A paradoxical increase was seen in the twitch movement of some muscles. MD affects the cathecolamine system in the CNS and human sleep. Since the sleep-awake rhythm and BM are thought to be related to the monoaminergic system in the CNS, we assume that his behavior and sleep disorders are the effects of the maternal MD administration during pregnancy. © 1986, All rights reserved.

AB  - The frequency of dexamethasone-induced cleft palate in mouse fetuses was studied at four fixed times on day 13 of gestation. On day 18, the fetuses were examined for malformations and corticosterone concentration was additionally measured. Evidence of a diurnal rhythm in cleft palate frequency, as well as in corticosterone level was obtained. A reciprocal relationship thereby exists. An increase in the teratogenicity was observed during the dark phase until transition from dark, to light. This transition is associated with a decrease in corticosterone. © 1986 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - A general scheme of neuroendocrine factors influencing the onset of puberty is presented. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is secreted in pulsatile fashion by the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Amplitude and probably frequency of the secretory pulses of GnRH increase at the time of puberty, stimulating the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins (LH and FSH). In turn, the gonadotropins induce the maturation of the ovarian follicles in the girls, spermatogenesis in the boys, and the secretion of estradiol or testosterone. The increase of the pulsatile secretion of GnRH is sufficient for explaining the onset of puberty. The response of the pituitary gonadotropins to GnRH would depend on the presence of sex steroids through the feedback mechanisms. The secretion of GnRH may be influenced by neurotransmitters. Norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine would stimulate GnRH secretion. Such effect, in fact, depends on the steroid milieu. Opposite effects can be observed in absence of estradiol. Serotonin has a negative effect on the GnRH secretion. Melatonin appears also to block GnRH secretion at the time of puberty. Finally, beta-endorphins decrease the frequency of GnRH secretion only in the presence of steroids. It is probable that stress and underweight act in blocking the pubertal development through the action of neurotransmitters, in particular catecholamines and beta-endorphins.

AB  - Oxygen consumption (V̇O2) and carbon dioxide production (V̇CO2) were continuously measured in premature humans (mean gestation age of 31 weeks at birth), nursed in incubators within a neutral thermal environment and submitted to continuous lighting. At a mean postnatal age of 30 days, and for a mean body weight of 1.8 kg, spectral analysis shows V̇O2 and V̇CO2 ultradian variations of mean and low frequencies (2&lt;f&lt;80 c.day - 1; i.e. periods 12&gt;t&gt;0.3 hr). It is hypothesized that these periodic variations can be compared to those previously evidenced in small laboratory vertebrates and in macaques.

AB  - Normal serum prolactin levels range from 5 to 20 ng/ml (circadian rhythm, effect of stress, relation with estrogen secretion). Neuroleptics increase serum prolactin levels. Normal concentrations are restored within 24 to 48 hours of discontinuation of the drug. When neuroleptics are given for a long period of time, serum prolactin concentrations fall gradually to low levels. There is no conclusive evidence that prolactin plays a role in breast tumors in women. Epidemiologic studies have shown that neuroleptics are not responsible for increased incidences of these tumors.

AB  - The plasma levels of human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS), estriol (E3), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHA-S), cortisol and the circadian changes of the two last adrenal hormones were studied in 25 pregnant methadone-addicted women (MA) and 21 pregnant drug-naive controls (C) at different periods of gestation and in 13 non-pregnant women (7 MA and 6 drug-naive). MA pregnant women showed normal plasma levels of hCS both at the second (6.9 ± 0.1 vs. 7.2 ± 0.1 μg/ml) and third (9.6 ± 0.2 vs. 9.3 ± 0.2) trimester, while plasma concentrations of E3 at term were lower than normal (MA: 4.4 ± 0.8; C: 8.2 ± 1.0 ng/ml, P < 0.05). DHA-S plasma levels of MA pregnant women were half the normal values in three trimesters of gestation, while there were no differences in non-pregnant subjects. Circadian variations of cortisol and DHA-S plasma levels were present in both MA and C. The blunted DHA-S but normal cortisol plasma levels found in MA pregnant women indicate that opiate abuse interferes with adrenal function, mainly of the fetus. Due to the scarce availability of adrenal precursors, these data suggest that E3 measurements should not be considered as a useful index of fetal well-being in the presence of opiate addiction. © 1986.

AB  - Pregnant mice were treated intraperitoneally with 5-fluorouracil in a single dose of 30 mg/kg once on gestation day 11 at one of four selected times along the 24-hr time scale. All animals were kept under a lighting regimen of 12 hr (0600-1800) alternating with 12 hr of darkness. They were injected at the same circadian phase as they were mated. The developmental age of all fetuses was 264 ± 1 hr at the time of injection. Fetuses collected on day 18 showed a circadian variation in teratogenic susceptibility to 5-fluorouracil. The lethal and teratogenic risk posed by the drug were highest among animals treated at the mid-light period until the onset of darkness. © 1986 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - The temporal relationship between time of birth and daily physical activity has been studied in rats submitted to different feeding rhythms. Animals, put under 14 h of light and 10 h of darkness (lights on from 6 to 20 h), were isolated at mating (day 1 of gestation) and assigned from day 8 to one of five groups. Group C was fed ad libitum, and groups 2PF, 9PF, 14PF and 21PF had food available for three hours per day from 2, 9, 14 and 21 h, respectively. In groups 9PF and 14PF, births were clustered in one single period during the night between days 22 and 23 of gestation. In groups C, 2PF and 21PF, births were distributed into two periods, during the afternoon of day 22 before darkness and after dawn of day 23. The birth rates of these groups were 55.3, 74.2 and 27.6%, respectively, on day 22 and 44.7, 25.8 and 72.4% on day 23. No births occurred during the times that food was available; they were noted in all groups at times when the animals were least active according to records kept throughout gestation. Thus, restricting food availability to periods of normal inactivity (groups 9PF and 14PF vs group C) led to a major shift in the time of delivery as well as to a distortion of the normal activity patterns. These results confirm that feeding rhythms are potent entrainers of birth time in rats and that they interact with the light regime. Pregnant rats seem to be organized so that birth either precedes the main daily physical activity or follows it, depending upon the environmental conditions.

AB  - Removal of the superior cervical ganglia suppresses the inhibitory role of short days in prolactin secretion and luteal activity in pregnant or pseudopregnant mink. Alternatively, timed injections of melatonin replicate the inhibitory role of short days in females maintained under long days. To understand if the diurnal variation of melatonin secretion is part of the mechanism by which the mink measure day length, diurnal variations in plasma melatonin concentrations have been measured in intact and ganglionectomized females maintained under long or short days after mating. Melatonin was measured by radioimmunoassay according to Brun et al. [Adv. Biosci. 53: 41–45]. In intact females, plasma concentrations ranged from nondetectable levels to 40 pg/ml during the day, increased shortly after the onset of the dark phase, and reached peak values during the middle of the night. The duration of the elevated levels was roughly proportional to the length of the night. No diurnal variations could be detected in ganglionectomized females; melatonin levels never exceeded the day values observed in intact females. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - A randomised prospective study of treatment with dietary restriction alone or insulin therapy with dietary advice was performed in 15 women with glucose intolerance diagnosed early in the third trimester of pregnancy. Twentyfour hour profiles of plasma glucose and 3-hydroxybutyrate were performed before and four weeks after commencing treatment. The effect on neonatal outcome was assessed. The case history of one of the patients in the study was sent to British physicians with a special interest in diabetes to obtain their opinion about the appropriate initial treatment of women with gestational diabetes.

AB  - Sub‐hourly variations in salivary estriol were measured in women in the last trimester of pregnancy. the mean and variation of salivary estriol concentrations in specimens collected at 5‐min intervals for 30 min were greater on awakening in the morning (when subjects were recumbent and fasting) than in the afternoon. the differences in variation between morning and afternoon serial specimens were eliminated by the omission of the first two specimens collected in the morning. Significant differences between the mean concentrations obtained for morning and afternoon specimens were minimized by use of a recumbent posture for the afternoon specimen collection. the mean estriol concentration of four saliva samples collected at 5‐min intervals for 15 min did not differ significantly from the concentration of saliva collected continuously over the subsequent 15 min. For routine estriol monitoring, therefore, samples should be collected over a 15‐min period. This ought to be carried out at the same time of day, in the same posture on each occasion, but preferably not in the early morning. 1986 Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand

AB  - Three hundred three pregnant ewes were randomly allotted to treatments in a 2 (diet) X 2 (feeding time) factorial arrangement 10 d before the first lambs were due in two lambing seasons to study the effect of time of feeding and diet on time of lambing. Behavioral activities were observed to determine if there was a relationship to time of parturition. All ewes were fed .5 kg ground whole corn per day plus either: alfalfa hay fed at 2200 each day, alfalfa hay fed at 1000 each day, alfalfa haylage fed at 2200 each day or alfalfa haylage fed at 1000 each day. Lambing data from 1983 and 1984 were combined across years because no treatment X year interactions (P greater than .05) were detected. Average time of day for lambing did not differ (P greater than .05) among treatments. In general, no differences due to treatments were observed in lambing time or behavioral activities studied. When data were pooled across treatments, two peak lambing times were observed. These peak times for lambing were from 0300 to 0700 (22.1%) and from 1500 to 1900 (22.5%). During these two 4-h periods (8 h total) 44.6% of the ewes gave birth.

AB  - In the pregnant tethered sow, water intake and motor activity were found to be related to urinary problems and productivity. Therefore, further studies were undertaken on these points. The 258 pregnant sows from eight breeding finishing herds were submitted to water intake control and the investigation of motor activity was performed on 125 pregnant sows from 6 herds. Despite the same process of water supply, the intake varied a lot from sow to sow (mean: 17 litres/day/pregnant sow, (sigma = 6.9 l). The major part of water was drunk during feeding time. The following factors were found associated with water intake: body condition, lameness, parity, stage of pregnancy. The relations between water intake and urine composition were assessed. A low water intake was close related to high urine gravity and to abnormalities (crystals, proteinuria, bacteriuria). The pregnant tethered sows spent an average time of 250 min in the standing position. A diurnal rhythm was clearly observed and it was synchronized by feeding time. The following factors were found to be related to the standing time: parity, body condition, lameness. The frequency of standing up per 24 hours was not related to the total standing time. Under farm husbandry, standing time is rather inconstant in individual sows on subsequent days. Since photo cell apparatus cannot be used as a routine in veterinary practice, we have looked for a more simple method: the position of the sows one hour after feeding time. This index gave an accurate view of the total standing time and represented a practical parameter for epidemiological purposes. The relevance of measuring water intake and motor activity in veterinary practice is discussed.

Progressive changes were found during the day, but not during the feed. A diurnal variation in milk lactose was seen, which was the inverse of the oligosaccharides. Significant negative correlations between lactose and oligosaccharides were seen in the afternoon and evening (p < 0.05). The minimal mean value of lactose at 19.00 h is 58.64 ± 5.28 g/1 and the maximal mean values of oligosaccharides was 17.93 ± 2.28 g/l. The data are discussed with regard to other milk constituents and to their possible physiological relevance. © 1985 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Cervical mucin was quantitated in individual samples collected daily during midcycle in 14 normally menstruating women. Quantisation was performed with a recently developed lectin-mediated light scattering (nephelometry) method after separation of soluble proteins from the mucin. Furthermore, mucin was quantitated in individual samples in another group of 12 women from whom cervical secretion samples had been collected hourly from 8.00 to 12.00 a.m. There were significant differences between cycle days (p < 0.05; two-way analysis of variance) for total amounts of mucin secreted and for mucin concentrations. But during repeated sample collection, only the total amounts of mucin secreted and not the concentrations were affected. From trend analysis data it could be concluded that both mucin contents and water contents increased at midcycle. © 1986 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Even though fetal heart rate recordings are widely used to monitor fetal health, both antenatally and in labour, the underlying physiology is not well understood. For example, it is not known with any certainty whether the oscillations seen in fetal heart rate are highly organised, in reflection of underlying ultradian rhythms, or whether they are entirely random and haphazard. In order to answer this question, therefore, we have used mathematical techniques of time series analysis to look for clear evidence of ultradian rhythms in fetal heart rate recordings. We have found that specific short-term ultradian rhythms are indeed present, and that they can be measured objectively in terms of their frequency, amplitude and phase. Such rhythms have cycle lengths of 10 to 90 s and they can persist for long periods of time. They may also disappear and later reappear, locking back into synchrony again with previous oscillations. Individual rhythms may undergo amplitude change, phase shift, and perhaps even frequency shift. © 1986.

AB  - The effects of surgery and red light on prolactin (Prl) secretion were investigated in cycling and in pseudo-pregnant (PSP) rats. Secretion patterns of Prl were determined at hourly intervals from 07.00 to 22.00 h. Different regulatory mechanisms for Prl secretion were hypothesized for three time periods: A nocturnal (07.00-11.00 h), a prediurnal (14.00 -17.00 h), and a diurnal (19.00-22.00 h) period. The results demonstrate that red light can affect significantly Prl secretion, in particular nocturnal and prediurnal Prl secretion in estrous, diestrous day 1 and PSP rats. The effect of surgery varied with the time of the day and was dependent upon whether the animals, during the dark period, were maintained under full darkness or constant red dim illumination. In PSP rats the regulation of Prl secretion was different for the three time periods. In PSP day 0 rats there was a prediurnal surge of Prl secretion, comparable in timing and regulation to a prediurnal surge in estrous rats. This prediurnal surge was not evident on the other days of PSP. The regulation of nocturnal as well as diurnal Prl secretion was similar in PSP rats, but differed from cycling rats. The afternoon surge of Prl secretion on proestrus lasted the full afternoon and was basically one surge, distinct from all other surges. In diestrous rats Prl levels were low but showed a circadian variation. In summary, the effects of red light and surgery on Prl secretion varied with the physiological state and with the time of the day, indicating that the regulation of Prl secretion is complex and multimodal in nature. © 1986 S.

AB  - Generally, when newborns in intensive care units receive human milk, we do not know the quantity of nutrients in that milk because such analysis is time-con-suming and expensive. In our study, however, we sought (a) to compare fat, protein, lactose, and energy concentration of a three-times-a-day sampling with a 24-h expression and (b) to measure the difference between the calculated energy yield from protein, fat, and carbohydrate measurements and bomb calorimetry. At 14-18 days postpartum, 20 mothers of premature infants (30-34 weeks’ gestation) expressed milk three times a day: 8 a.m., 12 p.m., and 8 p.m. At these three times, each mother expressed 3-5 ml of fore-milk and 3-5 ml of hind-milk for the sampling; the result was pooled for a 24-h expression. Only fat concentration differed signify lactose, and energy concentration did not differ significantly between the two collection methods, 24-h expression and sampling. Moreover, we found no significant difference between the calculated number for energy content and the bomb calorimetry method of energy determination. The average fore-and hind-milk samples at 12 p.m. matched the 24-h milk expression. For clinical use, a milk sample obtained around 12 p.m. can predict macronutrient concentration, therefore allowing us to calculate an infant’s approximate nutrient consumption. © 1986 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.

AB  - In order to test whether the alterations in photoreceptor synaptic terminal size and shape reported in lower vertebrates occur in a mammalian visual system, adult and fetal guinea pig retinas were exposed to an LD 12:12 lighting cycle, as well as to long‐term light (LL) and long‐term dark (DD) regimes. Representative random samples from all retinal quadrants, obtained at various times during these lighting regimes, were processed for electron microscopy. The synaptic terminals of all three photoreceptor cell types in this retina (alpha and paranuclear rods, and cones) were analyzed with computer‐assisted morphometrics for changes in their area, perimeter, synaptic vesicle density, and the degree of plasmalemmal infolding. The data showed all three types of adult receptor terminals to have increased area and vesicle density, as well as decreased membrane infolding, during the light period, while both types of rods showed increased perimeter measurements in the dark. Results from adults maintained under extended lighting conditions (LL and DD) showed no difference when compared with sample times during a typical LD 12:12 lighting regimen where clear statistical differences existed. Data from fetal retinas showed no significant sustainable pattern in any of the measured variables. These quantitative findings have led to the conclusion that while alterations in perimeter measurements may be explained by using the vesicle recycling hypothesis, observed changes in terminal size and shape may be controlled by a light‐initiated or light‐enhanced mechanism and effected through an annular configuration of cross‐striated fibrils found within these photoreceptor synaptic terminals.

AB  - Maternal low-level stress was found to produce persistent changes in serotonin (5-HT) receptor binding in several brain regions of the offspring. [3H]5-HT binding was increased in cerebral cortex, decreased in hippocampus and unchanged in pons medulla while [3H]spiperone binding was increased in all three regions at 60 days of age. The binding changes appeared to be due to altered numbers of binding sites with no change in dissociation constants. Regional differences were also found when the ability of nerve terminals to synthesize [14C]5-HT from L-[14C]tryptophan was studied. Prenatal stress reduced the rate of [14C]5-HT synthesis in hippocampus but not in cortex or pons medulla. When younger offspring were studied, binding of [3H]5-HT to cerebrocortical membranes was found to be reduced at 16 days of age and increased at 40 days while [3H]spiperone showed only an increased binding at 40 days. In contrast, prenatal stress resulted in increased nighttime locomotor activity whether measured at 23, 40 or 60 days of age. The present study provides additional evidence that prenatal stress affects the development of serotonergic neurons and it is possible that such changes may underlie the reported behavioural deficits in offspring of stressed female rats. © 1986.

AB  - The striated bulbocavernosus (BC) muscles of the rodent perineum are innervated by motoneurons in the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus (SNB). In adulthood, the BC muscles are present in males only. However, newborn female rats have BC muscles, and SNB cells have made both anatomical and functional contact with them. Nevertheless, both motoneurons and muscles will degenerate unless androgens are administered perinatally. Such androgen treatment appears to be acting primarily on the BC muscles themselves, since the muscles are spared by androgen even after the loss of supraspinal neural afferents or even the entire lumbosacral spinal cord. Furthermore, androgen can spare SNB motoneurons that are themselves androgen insensitive. Perinatal steroid treatments can also alter the final spinal location of SNB cells as determined by retrograde tracing studies. Androgen continues to modify the morphology of the SNB system in adulthood, altering the size of both motoneurons and targets, which may be important for the reproductive function of BC muscles. Finally, the sexually dimorphic character of motoneuronal groups innervating perineal muscles seems to be common in mammals, since the homologue of the SNB, Onuf's nucleus, has more cells in males than in females in both dogs and humans.

AB  - Behavioral and neurochemical changes were examined in pups after repeated prenatal treatment with methamphetamine (MAP). MAP-pretreated pups showed decreased total motor activity with increased vertical activity. The reactivity to sound stimuli in MAP-pups differed from that in controls, suggesting impaired reactivity to the surroundings. No difference was found in development of the circadian rhythm of motor activity between MAP- and control pups. No behavioral sensitization to MAP was found in MAP-pups, regardless of the repeated prenatal exposure to MAP. This finding suggests that there is a certain developmental stage of the brain that is critical for long-term sensitization to dopamine agonists due to chronic MAP administration. Coincident with this, no change was found in the striatal catecholamine concentrations in MAP-pups. Radioreceptor assaying of various neurotransmitter receptors showed a significant decrease in the Bmax of 3H-spiperone binding in the frontal cortex of MAP-pups. These findings suggest that prenatal treatment with MAP produces impaired reactivity to the surroundings, in which the hyper-serotonergic state of the frontal cortex may play an important role. © 1986, All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter presents an account of the recent advances in the understanding of the origins, functions, and clinical significance of insulin-like growth factors. The term “somatomedin” was coined over a decade ago to describe partly characterized plasma factors that (1) stimulated sulfate incorporation into chondroitin sulfate of cartilage, (2) has insulin-like activity (not neutralized by anti-insulin serum) in adipose tissue and diaphragm, and (3) caused increased thymidine incorporation into DNA in various tissues. The chapter describes where and how somatomedins are produced and transported in the circulation, how somatomedins interact with their target tissues and those concerned with the measurement of somatomedins, and the physiological and clinical significance of their levels in the circulation. The past few years have seen major advances in the understanding of insulin-like growth factor action, culminating in direct demonstrations of growth effects in laboratory animals. Thus, it seems probable that an exciting and fruitful period of research into the somatomedins is expected to follow over the next few years. © 1986, Academic Press Inc.

AB  - Prolactin plasma concentration during pregnancy was determined in rats treated with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Day 0 of pregnancy was defined as the day sperm were first found in the vagina. All blood samples were obtained in unanesthetized rats which had previously received a cannula in the right common carotid. On Day 8 of pregnancy, plasma prolactin concentrations reached a peak between 2400 and 0800 hr (lights on from 0600 to 1800 hr). Injection of TRH (1 μg/kg body wt) via the carotid artery increased plasma prolactin levels within 5 min. The largest increase occurred when TRH was given during the prolactin surge, whereas much smaller effects were found when TRH was given at the beginning or after the end of the surge period. Thus, the sensitivity of the prolactin cell to TRH appears to be the greatest when the secretory activity of the cell is high. It was then determined whether there was any change in the sensitivity of the prolactin cell to TRH after the prolactin surges had disappeared at midpregnancy. Injection of TRH between 1100 and 1200 hr increased prolactin less on Day 12 than on Day 8 of pregnancy. Since placental lactogen (PL) levels in the plasma are high on Day 12 compared to Day 8, and are inhibitory to prolactin secretion, it was reasoned that PL may be the factor which caused the reduced sensitivity to TRH. However, hysterectomy on Day 11 failed to increase the pituitary responsiveness to TRH the next day. In summary, these data indicate that the pituitary responsiveness to factors that stimulate prolactin, such as TRH, varies with relation to the time of pregnancy or presence of the nocturnal surge. What cellular mechanism is responsible for these sensitivity changes is not known. © 1986, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - The clinical usefulness of gynecologic age (GA) (the difference between chronologic age [CA] and menarchal age [MA]) is controversial. We compared CA and GA with bone age (BA) (the standard reference criterion for biologic maturity), in 107 Caucasian girls who ranged in age from 8.3 to 18.5 years. Chronologic age and GA each correlated significantly with BA. Regression analysis revealed no significant difference between the BAs of early-maturing girls and late-maturing girls of the same CA. However, the BAs of late-maturing girls were significantly greater than those of early-maturing girls of the same GA. Chronologic age may be preferable to GA in studies of adolescents that require an assessment of biologic maturity because CA is a more accurate measure of BA than is GA. © 1986, American Medical Association.

AB  - Possible negative effects of maternal antiepileptic medication on fetal motility and heart rate patterns were examined at 32 and 38 wk of gestation. Fetal eye and body movements were recorded using 2 real-time ultrasound units. Comparison between pregnancies with antiepileptic medication and control pregnancies did not show marked differences in patterns of motility and heart rate. Duration of sleep states, occurrence and duration of body movements in state 2F and statistical parameters of heart rate level and heart rate variability were very similar for both groups. This preliminary study, limited to mostly combined treatment with antiepileptic drugs, could not demonstrate any obvious effect on fetal neuromuscular development from maternal antiepileptic medication. © 1986.

AB  - Physiologic changes during the last trimester of pregnancy include reduced functional residual capacity and residual volume, increased alveolar-arterial difference for oxygen, and in the supine position reduced cardiac output. In conjunction with sleep-related apnea or hypoventilation, these could lead to maternal oxygen desaturation during sleep. Because we could not find detailed respiratory sleep studies in late pregnancy, we performed complete polysomnography on 6 pregnant women at 36 wk gestation and again postpartum. Contrary to what we expected, oxygenation was well maintained, with neither mean nor minimal arterial oxygen saturation significantly different during pregnancy. Frequency of apnea and hypopnea and total apnea and hypopnea time were significantly reduced during pregnancy. This finding may be due to increased levels of progesterone during pregnancy and may contribute to preservation of maternal oxygenation during late pregnancy.

AB  - Abstract: Our previous experiments showed that suppression of early postnatal active (REM) sleep increases alcohol intake in adult rats. To study the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neonatal sleep‐wake behaviour and adult alcohol consumption pregnant rat dams were given 7% to 12% alcohol, 1% sucrose solution, or tap water as a sole liquid throughout gestation. Sleep‐wake behaviour of the pups was studied at 6, 8, 12 and 15 days of age by using a movement sensitive mattress. The offspring who were exposed to alcohol in utero had significantly less active sleep and more wakefulness from total recording time than the controls. Their quiet state was also interrupted more often by waking episodes. At the age of 2 months voluntary alcohol intake of the rats exposed prenatally to alcohol was elevated compared to the controls. These findings suggest that early postnatal active sleep and the neurotransmitter systems regulating it may be the means by which in utero alcohol exposure affects adult alcohol drinking. 1986 Nordic Pharmacological Society

AB  - The role played by the medial preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus (MPOA-AH) in the regulation of reproductive function of the female rat was examined in the first part of the present study. Extensive bilateral lesions placed in different locations of the MPOA-AH continuum resulted in three different patterns of vaginal smears. Lesions located most rostrally and dorsally, sparing the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), resulted in series of successive pseudopregnancies. Lesions located more caudally and ventrally. still sparing the SCN, eventuated in regular oestrous cycles with only occasional pseudopregnancies. MPOA-AH lesions encroaching upon the SCN were associated with persistent vaginal cornification. MPOA-AH-lesioned females exhibiting repeated pseudopregnancies were capable of mating, conceiving, and giving birth. Parturition in these females was uniformly delayed by 1 day and was associated with a variable incidence of stillbirth, cannibalism of newborn, or incomplete placeniophagy. As a rule. M PO A-lesion ed mothers did not retrieve pups but they did show crouching behaviour and some of them even secreted milk. Thus, while the MPOA subserves in the regulation of oestrous cyclicity and maternal behaviour, it appears to play no essential role in mating behaviour or in ovarian function during pregnancy and lactation. The pattern of prolactin secretion in MPOA-AH-lesioned male and female rats was evaluated in the second part of this study. Both intact and orchidectomized males were incapable of generating nocturnal prolactin surges following extensive bilateral ablation of the MPOA-AH. On the other hand, 6 out of 9 ovariectomized MPOA-AH-lesioned females exhibited spontaneous nightly surges of prolactin. The absence of the surges in the remaining 3 females was associated with invasion of the lesion into the SCN and/or structures rostral to the MPOA. During the light period, prolactin levels remained within the basal range in all lesioned females, irrespective of the presence or the absence of the nocturnal surge. These lesioned ovariectomized females, in contrast to nonlesioned females, were incapable of producing a diurnal (afternoon) surge of prolactin in response to administration of oestrogen, though their basal prolactin levels were much higher than the levels seen in oestrogen-treated, nonlesioned castrated males. These results support the view that the MPOA is inhibitory to the nocturnal prolactin surge while stimulatory to the diurnal surge. The results also suggest that the male rat is functionally devoid of both a ‘diurnal-surge centre’ residing in the MPOA. and a ‘nocturnal-surge centre’ located outside the MPOA. © 1986 S.

AB  - Sleep/wake states were investigated in rat pups at 12-13 days of age following deprivation of milk and their dam for 9-12 hr. Early in the deprivation period each pup was equipped with bipolar stainless steel electrodes for electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings. Four groups of pups were tested using anesthetized dams. The pups were either (a) allowed to root in the dam's fur, but were not allowed to attach to a nipple; (b) allowed to root after receiving a gut load of rat's milk; (c) allowed to attach and suck a nipple without receiving milk; or (d) allowed to attach and suck a nipple following a gut load of rat's milk. The results indicate that sucking elicits sleep, especially slow-wave sleep. Milk in the gut enhanced paradoxical sleep, primarily in the context of sucking. This experiment confirms that the types of sleep can be affected separately by specific internal and external events. The shift in the sleep/wake condition to slow-wave sleep in the suckling situation suggests one type of satiety. Furthermore, the selective enhancement of paradoxical sleep following the gut load of milk suggests postingestive satiety. © 1986.

AB  - This study of mother-baby sleep patterns used an exploratory descriptive approach. The subjects were a sample of convenience of nine first time mothers and their baby. Data were collected by means of unstructured non-directive interviews and the Nursing Child Assessment Sleep Activity Record (NCASAR) during the second to fourth postpartum weeks. The findings showed that most of the mothers obtained as many hours of sleep in the postpartum period as they did prior to pregnancy. However, this sleep was subject to many interruptions. All of the subjects felt less rested and complained of tiredness which they ascribed to meeting the needs of their baby rather than with actual reduction in the number of sleep hours. The mothers described tiredness in two ways, physical and emotional. Support from partner and others was critical to the mothers in assisting them to adapt to and cope with the responsibilities of motherhood. The findings of this study confirmed the unpredictable nature of baby sleep-wake cycles during the early postpartum period. © 1986 Longman Group UK Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - ABSTRACT – A survey of 67 pregnancies in 51 professional women (physicians, psychologists, nurses, administrators, etc.) revealed the occurrence of symptoms of cognitive dysfunction such as forgetfulness, disorientation, confusion and reading difficulties in 28 pregnancies occurring in 21 women. These were unrelated to such factors as age of delivery, percentage weight gain, the baby's sex or birth weight, alcohol consumption, smoking, a history of migraine or allergy or other symptoms occurring during pregnancy such as sleepiness and lack of concentration, irritability, loss of interest in job or nightmares. Nor was there any correlation with hypertension, proteinuria, glycosuria, ketonuria, anemia, or morning sickness. Furthermore, these cognitive disturbances were not related to depression or sleep deprivation. Despite these symptoms, none of the women suffering from them were forced to interrupt their professional activities during pregnancy. The syndrome of benign encephalopathy of pregnancy should be recognized so that simple precautions can be taken to prevent any interference with professional or other activities. The etiology of the syndrome is unknown. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Experiments were done on chronically prepared fetal lambs, 125-135 days gestation, to test the effects of various catecholamines on fetal breathing (FB) as well as the influence of isoproterenol on the fetal respiratory response to hypoxemia. Bolus injections of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol (5-20 μg) were administered via the lingual artery or femoral or jugular vein during periods of FB activity or apnea. The effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine on FB were variable and not statistically significant. Isoproterenol produced a significant increase in FB, frequency of breathing, and mean inspiratory effort, when infused during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep but it failed to induce FB during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. The positive response during REM sleep was absent following pretreatment with 3-5 mg propranolol and after bilateral section of the sinus nerves. The effect of hypoxia on FB was tested before and during constant infusion of isoproterenol (1 μg/min iv). A reduction of the fetal arterial Po2 by 3-10 Torr produced the characteristic depression of FB in either situation. These results indicate that the fetal carotid body chemoreceptors can reflexly stimulate FB under certain circumstances but that their effectiveness is limited by more powerful inhibitory mechanisms such as those operative during NREM sleep and hypoxemia.

AB  - This preexperimental study explored the relationships among maternal aerobic exercise, self-esteem, and physical discomforts during pregnancy by comparing groups of exercising and nonexercising pregnant women. The convenience sample was comprised of 31 women who participated in aerobic exercise and 22 women who did not. All subjects, who were at least 27 weeks pregnant, completed three questionnaires: Self-History Form, Pregnancy Discomfort Checklist, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The group of women who exercised had statistically significant higher self-esteem and lower physical discomfort scores than the group of women who did not exercise. Statistically significant lower scores were found in the exercise group for the symptoms of backache, headache, fatigue, shortness of breath, and hot flashes. There was a statistically significant inverse relationship between amount of exercise and discomforts reported in the third trimester. These findings suggest that exercise during pregnancy is associated with higher self-esteem and lower discomfort scores. However, interpretation of these findings is limited by a lack of random assignment to groups, which might have resulted in a selection bias. © 1986.

AB  - Pregnant rats were deprived of paradoxical sleep for 3 days starting on the 18th gestational day. The condition of PS-D was imposed by confinement on a small platform surrounded by water or by daily injections of clomipramine. Four hours before the killing rats received a s.c. injection of [3H]-thymidine. The amount of radioactive DNA determined by autoradiography in several regions of fetal brain was found to be markedly increased under both experimental conditions in comparison with the control fetal brain. Considerably more limited effects were observed in kidney. Comparable changes of lower magnitude were obtained by comparing the specific radioactivity of DNA samples purified by chlorophorm extraction and digestion with RNase and proteinase K. The results fully confirm our previous data obtained under similar experimental conditions but based on the analysis of an acid-washed DNA fraction. © 1986.

AB  - Experiments were conducted in 11 unanesthetized fetal sheep during the last third of gestation to examine the effects of prolonged, reversible reduction in uterine blood flow on fetal electrocortical activity, breathing movements, and skeletal muscle activity. With an adjustable clamp placed around the maternal common internal iliac artery, uterine blood flow was restricted for 2 hours to produce a reduction in fetal arterial oxygen saturation from 56.1% ± 1.9% to 28.8% ± 0.7%. When blood flow was reduced, there was a decrease in the percentage of time that fetuses spent in low-voltage electrocortical activity, from 57.5% ± 3.0% to 37.8% ± 3.5%, and a decrease in the incidence of both breathing movements and integrated skeletal muscle activity. Younger fetuses (110 to 121 days' gestation) demonstrated a lesser degree of reduction in breathing movements when compared with older fetuses (125 to 140 days) whereas the effects of hypoxemia on electrocortical activity became less apparent with advancing gestational age. © 1986.

AB  - Functional development of eye movement in the human fetus in utero was assessed quantitatively, with real-time ultrasound. A pair of lens-derived echoes was used as a landmark to evaluate positional deviation with eye movement. The frequency of eye movement was measured either with 1-minute continuous observations or at 1-minute cross sections. Two hundred forty-five normal fetuses between 18 and 42 weeks of gestation were studied. Three critical ages, with respect to physiologic development of fetal eye movements, were evident: 22 to 25, 30 to 33, and 38 to 41 weeks. The first and the second indicate the onset of the moderate-frequency and high-frequency eye movements, thereby implying a transition, presumably to a state of so-called rapid eye movement and a rise of rapid eye movement, respectively. The third represents full maturation of the mechanisms, that is, non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement. © 1986.

AB  - The inability to see the fetus makes the assessment of fetal behavior difficult. To circumvent this problem we implanted a Plexiglas window in the left flank of the ewe. Fetuses were instrumented for measurements of sleep, breathing, and swallowing. Ten fetal sheep were studied on 32 occasions. Six fetuses were delivered through the window at term, and postnatal behavior was compared with intrauterine behavior. Fetuses observed during resting conditions alternated between periods of quiet sleep [high-voltage electrocortical activity (ECoG)] and active or rapid-eye-movement sleep (low-voltage ECoG). In quiet sleep, movements were absent except for periodic generalized electromyographic discharges. Eye and breathing movements were rare or absent. Swallowing was also absent. In active sleep, movements were increased with powerful breathing and swallowing activity. Fetal wakefulness defined by open eyes and purposeful movements of the head was never seen in utero but was clearly observed after delivery. We conclude that fetal wakefulness as defined postnatally was not able to be demonstrated in utero.

AB  - Seventeen appropriate-for-gestational-age premature infants (birthweights 1000-1530 gm) were randomly assigned to control (7) and vestibular stimulation (10) groups. Those in the treatment group were exposed daily to three 15-minute sessions of sinusoidal vestibular stimulation over a 2-week period. At the end of that period, postconceptional age ranged from 34 to 37 weeks. As a measure of neurologic maturation, behavioral and physiologic parameters characterizing sleep states were recorded at the onset and termination of the 2-week period. The ratio of active-to-quiet sleep did not change significantly in control patients. Those exposed to vestibular stimulation showed a significant decrease in proportion of active and a concommitant increase in the proportion of quiet sleep. These results may indicate that vestibular stimulation, even at this early postconceptional age, results in a more mature sleep pattern. © 1986, by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The study of the REM-process by means of the oculomotor frequencies has shown that it is a stochastic point process. Therefore, the techniques utilized to quantify the time-dependency of this process were used. The structure of occurrence of REM's quantified by transition probability matrixes evidenced a two-state first order semi-Markov process. The oculo-motor configurations of REM-sleep revealed two independent entities, their number and their relative frequencies. This conclusion was used as a working hypothesis for the Spacelab 1 sleep-recording experiment in zero-gravity. The results confirmed the underlying hypothesis. © 1986 Editions Scientifiques Elsevier, Paris.

AB  - Infants born to opiate-abusing mothers have a decreased ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and a five to ten times increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome These abnormalities of ventilatory control may be associated with abnormal sleeping ventilatory patterns. Therefore, 28 overnight pneumograms were obtained from 27 infants of substance-abusing mothers and compared with pneumograms from 43 control infants. Pneumograms were quantitated for total sleep time, greatest duration of apnea, total duration of apnea greater than or equal to 6 s, periodic breathing, and mean heart and respiratory rates. The ISAM had a longer total sleep time, greater durations of apnea, a higher total duration of apneas greater than or equal to 6 s, more periodic breathing, a higher mean respiratory rate, and a lower mean heart rate. Thirty-two percent of pneumograms from ISAM were abnormal compared with 9.3% of the control pneumograms. We conclude that ISAM have abnormal sleeping ventilatory patterns that may be related to their increased SIDS risk. © 1986, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - The temperament of a group of preterm infants (n = 126) was studied as part of a large, longitudinal study of infant temperament and behavior in a representative sample of Austrialian infants (n = 2443). Utilizing the Infant Temperament Questionnaire of Carey and McDevitt, previously revised and validated for an Australian population, ratings were made at 4 to 8 months corrected age, and data for the preterm group (less than 37 weeks gestation) were compared to those infants born at term (37 to 41 weeks). There were no significant differences between the two groups on any of the sociodemographic variables, on the mother's global rating of temperament, or on the reported incidence of colic, sleep problems, and excessive crying. There were also no differences between premature and full-term infants on any of the individual dimensions or clinical categories of temperament. We conclude that prematurity per se does not affect observed temperament at 4 to 8 months. However, we cannot extend these conclusions to high-risk infants who experience medical complications of prematurity, and who require intensive care for prolonged periods of time. These may represent an entirely different category of risk for subsequent difficult temperament and behavior problems. © 1986 by Williams & Wilkins Co.

AB  - Twenty-two children prenatally exposed to clonidine and no other hypotensive drugs were compared at a mean age of 6.3 ± 1.6 years to a non-exposed control group, matched for degree of maternal hypertension, sex, birthweight and gestational age. There were no differences in head circumference, neurological findings, school performance and a number of behavioural characteristics except for a marginal excess of hyperactivity and an excess of sleep disturbances in the study group. It is questionable whether the differences represent a direct effect of clonidine on prenatal development but the dose-effect relationship and the fact that the same effects have been found in rats suggest that this may be so. © 1986.

AB  - Transmission of information in the brain is of a chemical nature. Neurotransmitters are present at very early stages of brain development, having trophic effects on maturation of target neurons as well as mediating the behavioral repertoire of the immature brain. Many centrally acting psychoactive drugs which are commonly used (also during pregnancy) for treatment of depression, asthma, hypertension, epilepsy, parkinsonism, hyperkinetism and other neurological and psychiatric disorders act directly on brain neurotransmitters fin particular monoamines) and behavioral states. Disturbances observed later in life in animals and man, as a result of early interference with brain neurotransmitters, using these drugs, are not gross physical malformations but are in fact subtle behavioral and neurological symptoms such as hyperactivity, emotional lability, attentional distractability and sleep disturbances, similar to symptoms observed in the minimal brain dysfunction syndrome. © 1986, All rights reserved.

AB  - We have studied carbohydrate absorption in 40 healthy term infants and 10 preterm neonates (31-35 weeks gestation) by respiratory H2, fecal pH, and chromatographic analysis of stools. Sequential studies of H2excretion (24-h collection) in response to breast feeding were carried out in premature infants during the first 8 weeks of life. Five expired H2during the first 2 weeks, and two continued to do so in the 3rd to 4th weeks. Breath H2excretion fell below 10 ppm by 8 weeks and was not related to feeding or sleep. In term neonates, the frequency of incomplete carbohydrate absorption (4-h test) at the end of the first week was 36% for 14 breast-fed, 42% for 12 formula-fed, and 64% for 14 mixed-fed neonates (not significant differences). There were no significant differences between the absorbing and malabsorbing subjects in fecal pH. Chromatographic analysis showed only small quantities of sugars. In summary, incomplete carbohydrate absorption occurred in a high percentage of the newborns studied; the 24-h test evaluated better than the 4-h test; and negative breath H2excretion indicated development of the capacity of the small intestine to hydrolyze carbohydrates. In the majority of the preterm malabsorbing babies, completely functional lactase occurs within the first month of life. The growth modulators in human milk may increase the rate of maturing of the small intestine. © 1986 Raven Press, New York.

AB  - Fetal card iorespiratory changes during spontaneous prelabor uterine contractions (called contractures) were studied in 12 chronically catheterized fetal sheep at 120 to 143 days' gestation. During contractures the carcass blood flow increased significantly from 27 ± 2 (SEM) to 32 ± 3 ml/min/100 gm. There were no significant changes in combined ventricular output or in blood flow to the umbilical circulation, brain, heart, adrenal glands, gut, kidney, and lung. Fetal arterial blood pressure increased from 57 ± 2 to 62 ± 1 mm Hg (p < 0.001) during contractions. There were no significant changes in fetal heart rate. In the fetal femoral artery during contractures the oxygen content decreased from 6.1 ± 0.2 to 5.4 ± 0.2 ml/dl of blood (p < 0.001), and carbon dioxide tension increased significantly from 44 ± 0.4 to 45 ± 0.4 mm Hg (p < 0.001). The pH did not change. The increase in carcass blood flow during contractures suggests that there was an increase in fetal skeletal muscular activity or tone. An increase in fetal skeletal muscle activity, together with a decrease in uterine blood flow could explain the small decrease in fetal oxygen content that occurs with each contracture. Fetal compression and/or changes from rapid eye movement to synchronized sleep or arousal observed during contractures are possible stimuli causing increased fetal skeletal muscle tone or activity. Since contractures periodically result in neuromuscular activity in the fetus in its protected fluid-filled environment, they may play a key role in fetal neuromuscular development by stimulating “exercising” in the fetus in utero. © 1986, Mosby.

AB  - To compare postoperative well‐being after general and epidural anaesthesia. 58 women undergoing Caesarean section were divided into a general anaesthetic group receiving intramuscular opioid postoperatively (26). and an epidural group receiving morphine via the epidural route (32). The epidural group required less analgesia (p < 0.01 at 0.5 and 8 hours, p < 0.001 at 4 hours). There was no difference in the use of oral analgesics. At 1,4 and 24 hours after delivery more patients in the general anaesthesia group described themselves as very comfortable (p < 0.05). More in the epidural group had a very good night's sleep during each night studied. Patients in the epidural group were slower to use the ward toilet (p < 0.01) and had more itching (p < 0.001). Our conclusion is that patients progressed well in both groups. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The sensory receptors of the human fetus and their adequate stimulation are reviewed. Emphasis is put on the two main sensory routes through which the fetus may be stimulated: the hearing and the cutaneous senses. Most experimental and descriptive studies were done in these two well-defined areas. The core of the review deals with the description of sensory stimulation of the fetus as a function of the known behavioral states. It is postulated, and a series of experimental works cited in support, that reactions of the fetus to external stimuli, irrespective of the route through which they are presented, are subject to modulation by these states. It is proposed that an adequate stimulus in the normal, physiological range produces little or almost no effect in deep sleep (state 1 fetal) and does not change this state, whereas an inadequate stimulus which is strong ("painful") produces a definite change in state 1 fetal and is capable of triggering a change from state 1F to 2F (active sleep or rapid-eye-movement sleep). © 1986.

AB  - Twenty-five pregnant women between 36 and 40 weeks' gestational age were studied to examine effects of a 5-second external vibratory acoustic stimulus on fetal breathing and gross fetal body movement patterns. When the study period was compared with the control period, there was an immediate significant decrease in the incidence of fetal breathing movements that persisted for 1 hour after the stimulus. Moreover the fetal breathing pattern was more irregular for the hour after the stimulus. There was also a significant but delayed increase in the incidence of gross fetal body movements that persisted for 1 hour after the stimulus. We hypothesize that an external vibratory acoustic stimulus causes a change from a state of sleep to a state of wakefulness in near-term healthy fetuses. © 1986.

AB  - The effects of hypercapnia and hypoxemia on breathing movements were studied in 12 chronically decorticated fetal sheep, 127-140 days gestation. The fetal state of consciousness was defined in terms of activity of the lateral rectus and nuchal muscles. Arterial blood pressure was monitored. Fetal breathing was determined by integrated diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) and analyzed in terms of inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), electrical equivalent of tidal volume (EVT), breath interval (TT), duty cycle (TI/TT), mean inspiratory flow equivalent (EVT/TI), and instantaneous ventilation equivalent (EVT/TT). Fetal breathing occurred only during episodes of rapid-eye movements, and the response to hypercapnia consisted of an increase in EVT, TI, EVE, and EVT/TI and a decrease in the coefficient of variation of all measured parameters. Induction of hypoxia during episodes of spontaneous fetal breathing produced a decrease in the rate of breathing and an increase in EVT and TI with no change in the variability of all parameters studied. Since similar responses to hypercapnia and hypoxemia are seen in the intact fetus, we conclude that the cerebral cortex has no obvious effect on the chemical control of fetal breathing.

AB  - The Immunization Practices Advisory Committee in the USA recommends vaccination and/or prophylactic amantadine for target groups, some of whom are at risk of influenza infection. These groups include medical personnel in extensive contact with particularly susceptible patients. At a 1985 conference on influenza control organised by the US Centers for Disease Control, a major viewpoint expressed was for the routine immunisation of children who are household contacts of high-risk persons. In view of the frequency of adverse reactions produced by amantadine, the partial and short-term protection afforded by the vaccine, the benign nature of the illness in healthy individuals, and the failure of present programmes to reach those especially prone to serious illness, it would be better to intensify vaccination efforts among high-risk individuals.

AB  - The effects of methylmercury hydroxide (MeHgOH) on the hypnotic action of hexobarbital was investigated in adult 129/SvSl mice of both sexes. It was found that there was no sex difference in the response to MeHgOH treatment. The action of MeHgOH was intimately related to the interval between MeHgOH administration and the test of hexobarbital hypnosis. A biphasic effect was observed. An initial dose-dependent prolongation of hexobarbital hypnosis was observed in animals pretreated with MeHgOH 24 h earlier. If the interval was extended from 24 h to 1 week, a shortening of sleeping time was observed in MeHgOH treated animals. The animals recovered from the effects of MeHgOH in 3 weeks. The initial effect of MeHgOH was found closely related to the decrease in the rate of hexobarbital metabolism in the liver through lowering of cytochrome P-450 concentration. On the other hand, the delayed shortening of hexobarbital hypnosis was not related to the rate of hexobarbital metabolism. It is assumed that the delayed effect of MeHgOH on the hexobarbital hypnosis is due to MeHgOH acting on the central nervous system to decrease its sensitivity to hexobarbital via interaction with the barbiturate receptors on the GABA-chloride ionophore complex. In animals exposed in utero to MeHgOH, it was found that the duration of hexobarbital-induced sleeping time was significantly longer in the offsprings tested for hexobarbital hypnosis 3.5 months after birth following prenatal exposure to MeHgOH. Repeated administration of hexobarbital to adult offsprings prenatally exposed to MeHgOH and to control mice shortened hexobarbital sleeping time, however, the maximum shortening capacity was smaller in the treated group. It is concluded that the hypnotic action of hexobarbital in mice can be altered by MeHgOH exposure both prenatally and postnatally. The effects of prenatal exposure to MeHg were observed in adult offsprings, indicating that MeHg may have a functional teratogenic effect on barbiturate-induced hypnosis in the absence of gross anomalies. © 1986.

AB  - 1 A 10 day double‐blind study was carried out comparing isoxicam (300 mg day‐1) and piroxicam (40 mg day‐1 for the first two days and 20 mg day‐1 for the remaining days) following surgery in patients who had sustained skiing accidents. There were 20 patients in each group. The isoxicam‐treated group had a slightly greater mean pain score prior to treatment. 2 Both isoxicam and piroxicam reduced pain and nocturnal awakening at days 5 and 10, but isoxicam was significantly superior to piroxicam in producing improvement in pain (at day 5, P less than 0.05) and in nocturnal awakenings (at day 10, P less than 0.05). 3 Both agents facilitated rehabilitation and there was no significant difference between them in this regard. 4 All patients in both groups considered themselves ‘better’ or ‘much better’ on day 5 of treatment. 5 Both agents were well tolerated by most patients but one patient in each group left the trial because of abdominal pain. One patient stopped isoxicam when she was found to be pregnant. 1986 The British Pharmacological Society

AB  - Some 8% of Swiss citizens travel in the deeveloping countries annually. Advising these travellers is an important task for the physician, though the most frequent infections are the less serious travellers' diarrhea and common colds. To some extent the more serious tropical diseases can be avoided by appropriate measures, e.g. vaccination (against yellow fever, tetanus, polio etc.) and by chemoprophylaxis (malaria). Individual fitness for travel should be checked prior to any journey abroad, and special advice must be given to travellers with special risks (e.g. pregnant women, infants, persons with chronic diseases, diabetics etc.). Most important during a stay in the tropics is a sensible way of life with enough sleep, general hygiene, especially with regard to food, and avoidance of untreated water. Further safety measures are recommended for bathing, strong sun exposure, mountaineering above 10,000 ft and in general for exposure to special health risks. Recognition of risks and their avoidance is often the best prophylaxis.

AB  - A facsimile of the 1-page labor chart provided by the Ministry of Health and used at all maternity clinics in Malawi is described. Malawi has 350 maternity units which take care of 45% of deliveries. Personnel range from nonprofessional to registered nurse-midwives to physicians. The most notable feature of the chart is a partogram marked with "alert" and "action" lines, for comparing cervical dilation per hour. The alert line is a diagonal line starting at 3 cm dilated and fully effaced, drawn at an angle representing the slowest 10% of normal African primigravidas. Normally vaginal delivery would be expected at the time of the end of the action line. The action line is drawn arbitrarily 4 hours to the right, allowing time for normal delivery or transfer of the patient. Fetal descent is also charted in fifths of head palpable above the pelvic brim. There is room to the left of the page to chart progress in latent phase. One side of the chart contains demographic and admission data and the progress graph. The reverse side has space for pelvic assessment, results of 2nd and 3rd stage of labor and charting of up to 6 days' postpartum stay for mother and infant. There are blanks to record whether the woman has had sleep, food or homemade medicine, and room for making referrals. In practice fetal descent is followed by abdominal palpation hourly, fetal heart rate every 30 minutes, and charted as type 1, 2, or 3. Vaginal examinations are done every 4 hours for primigravidas and every 3 in multiparas. Fetal head molding is charted as -or 1+, 2+ or 3+.

AB  - Fetuses (37-40 wks DA) were exposed to three successive presentations of a 5-s high-pass filtered (800 Hz) pink noise either at 105 dB or at 110 dB SPL. Stimulations were given during high or low variability heart rate (HR) patterns (HV or LV) which presumably correspond mostly to active and quiet sleep episodes, respectively. The proportion of fetuses showing cardiac response (CR) was always greater than the proportion showing leg movement (LM) but the presence of an accompanying leg movement always increased the amplitude of CR, independent of HR pattern, stimulus repetition and intensity. Fetal reactiveness always diminished with stimulus repetition but diminished more on the three examined dimensions (CR ratio, LM ratio and CR amplitude) with LV infants than with HV infants, and more with the 105 dB stimulus than with the 110 dB stimulus. More importantly, stimulus parameters and HR patterns interacted. At 110 dB in HV, neither the median amplitude of the CRs nor the probability of a CR changed over trials but the probability of a concommittant LM decreased. At 110 dB in LV, repetition induced a decrement on all three response dimensions from the second trial onwards. At 105 dB in HV, LM decreased rapidly, as much as at 110 dB in LV. Thus, state, as reflected by HR pattern, plays a significant role in determining the occurrence and the amplitude of the CR and the occurrence of a LM which, in turn, will enhance the CR amplitude. © 1986.

AB  - Marijuana seems firmly established as another social drug in Western countries, regardless of its current legal status. Patterns of use vary widely. As with other social drugs, the pattern of use is critical in determining adverse effects on health. Perhaps the major area of concern about marijuana use is among the very young. Using any drug on a regular basis that alters reality may be detrimental to the psychosocial maturation of young persons. Chronic use of marijuana may stunt the emotional growth of youngsters. Evidence for an amotivational syndrome is largely based on clinical reports; whether marijuana use is a cause or effect is uncertain. A marijuana psychosis, long rumored, has been difficult to prove. No one doubts that marijuana use may aggravate existing psychoses or other severe emotional disorders. Brain damage has not been proved. Physical dependence is rarely encountered in the usual patterns of social use, despite some degree of tolerance that may develop. The endocrine effects of the drug might be expected to delay puberty in prepubertal boys, but actual instances have been rare. As with any material that is smoked, chronic smoking of marijuana will produce bronchitis; emphysema or lung cancer have not yet been documented. Cardiovascular effects of the drug are harmful to those with preexisting heart disease; fortunately the number of users with such conditions is minimal. Fears that the drug might accumulate in the body to the point of toxicity have been groundless. The potential deleterious effects of marijuana use on driving ability seem to be self-evident; proof of such impairment has been more difficult. The drug is probably harmful when taken during pregnancy, but the risk is uncertain. One would be prudent to avoid marijuana during pregnancy, just as one would do with most other drugs not essential to life or well-being. No clinical consequences have been noted from the effects of the drug on immune response, chromosomes, or cell metabolites. Contamination of marijuana by spraying with defoliants has created the clearest danger to health; such attempts to control production should be abandoned. Therapeutic uses for marijuana, THC, or cannabinoid homologs are being actively explored. Only the synthetic homolog, nabilone, has been approved for use to control nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. While little doubt remains that marijuana, THC, and nabilone are effective for this use, the advent of other drugs that are equally effective but with fewer adverse effects may make this use moot. Use of marijuana to reduce intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma requires a feasible topical preparation of cannabinoids. Although some cannabinoids have analgesic activity, the abundance of new opioid analgesics with little dependence liability provides tough competition. The use of marijuana as a muscle relaxant, though promising, has not yet been adequately studied. Clinical studies to establish the efficacy of cannabidiol as an anticonvulsant or to compare it with other anticonvulsants are still to be done. Other potential therapeutic uses, such as treatment of bronchitis, asthma, insomnia, hypertension, abstinence syndromes, migraine, anorexia, and alcoholism, are most unlikely prospects. Compared with other licit social drugs, such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, marijuana does not pose greater risk. One would wonder, however, if society were given a choice based on current knowledge, whether these drugs would have been granted their present status of acceptance. Marijuana may prove to have greater therapeutic potential than these other social drugs, but many questions still need to be answered.

AB  - The effects of anaesthetic techniques and drugs on 18 neonates born after elective Caesarean section were studied, employing computerized EEG. Three different groups, epidural, spinal and general anaesthesia, were compared with each other and with a control group after normal vaginal delivery. A new computerized EEG method, Zero Band Power Rate (ZBPR) analysis, was devised for this study and implemented together with conventional spectral EEG estimates of five frequency bands. ZBPR analysis was found to be much more sensitive than conventional spectral analyses for detecting differences between the study groups. Significant differences occurred between the general anaesthesia group and the epidural and control groups and also between the spinal group and the epidural and control groups. No signficant difference was seen between the epidural group and the control group. Significant differences were attributed to the clinical use of two drugs: thiopentone in the general anaesthesia group and ephedrine in the spinal group. The effects of these drugs on the neonatal EEG were reflected in decreased ZBPR values, particularly during sleep.

AB  - To examine the modulation of fetal systolic time intervals of the ovine fetus in relation to fetal maturation, heart rate, respiratory activity, and circadian rhythm, studies were carried out on 13 fetal-maternal sheep preparations. The data obtained showed that there was a significant correlation between the ejection time (ET) and the RR intervals of the electrocardiogram. The pre-ejection period (PEP) and PEP/ET increased in relation to the fetal maturation (38 ms and 0.25 at 120 days to 52 ms and 0.33 at 145 days of gestation, respectively). When the circadian rhythmicity was analyzed, a relative tachycardia was in evidence during the 21- to 03-h period but systolic time intervals remained unchanged. Except for some tachycardia and cardiac rhythm variability, respiratory activity also had no influence on the systolic time intervals.

AB  - Concentrations of placental protein 10 (PP10) were measured by radioimmunoassay and found to be detectable but very low in nonpregnant women and in men. In an assay of 223 samples from normal pregnancies, the mean PP10 level was 2.7 ± 1.0 ng/ml (mean ± SD) at 6 to 7 weeks of gestation. The level of PP10 in maternal sera increased gradually as pregnancy progressed to a high of 40.2 ± 19.0 ng/ml at 38 to 39 weeks, followed by a slight decrease to 28.9 ± 15.6 ng/ml at 40 to 41 weeks. The coefficients of variation were 8.6 to 16.2% in diurnal variation and 10.3 to 34% in day-to-day variaton. Relatively lower PP10 levels were observed in maternal sera in threatened abortion with poor prognosis, toxemia of pregnancy, intrauterine fetal death and placenta previa.

AB  - The DHEA-sulphate was applied in the 34th-41st weeks of pregnancy for the estimation of placental function (foetoplacental unit) in normal and pathological pregnancies. It has been established that: the peak of oestrogen excretion is in the dawn hours; the diurnal rhythm of E1 + E2 + E3 excretion is identical; the DHEA-SO4 → oestrogen conversion takes place immediately, and within the subsequent 8-10 hours the urinary oestrogen values return to the original level; in physiological pregnancies between the 34th-36th weeks the DHEA-sulphate test indicated normal function in 91% of the cases; in the 37th-41st weeks of apparently normal pregnancies the test showed pathological placental function in 50% of the cases; in pathological pregnancies between the 37th-41st weeks the test in 77% of the cases predicted placental dysfunction.

AB  - A major focus of theory building in nursing relates to further conceptualization of human-environmental interaction and multidimensional systems that support or do not support health. There is a growing body of knowledge regarding the newborn and his skills, and the transactions and interactions between the newborn and his environment. The newborn cannot be considered in isolation from his environment for it is this interaction with the environment that provides opportunities for organization of his behaviour, physiologic functions, and regulatory processes. The caregiving environment and the newborn's interactions with this environment form the ecologic niche of the newborn; one that will enhance or impede the infant's behavioral differentiation and organization, early adaptations, later development, and the infant's interactions with his parents and other caregivers.

AB  - Mink are long-lived mammals that exhibit seasonal changes in body weight, gonadal activity, pelage and plasma prolactin levels. Mating in February-March is followed by an obligatory delay in implantation during which the corpora lutea stay quiescent. All these events are controlled by annual variations in daylength. The role of the pineal gland and its product, melatonin, in conveying photic information to the target organs has been studied. Pineal denervation by bilateral ablation of the cervical superior ganglia rendered the mink unresponsive to artificial manipulations of the daily photoperiod: prolactin and progesterone secretion and the spring moult were no longer stimulated by long days or inhibited by short days in pregnant females; in the same way the increase in body weight in late summer and the autumn moult were no longer advanced by artificial shortening of the photoperiod. Pinealectomy seemed to desynchronize body weight, prolactin and moulting cycles from those in intact mink. Melatonin injections reproduced the effects of short days on hormonal secretion during the delayed implantation period. Melatonin capsules given to males during the phase of testicular activity delayed the decrease in body weight, testicular regression and onset of the spring moult exactly as did short days. In contrast, melatonin administered during the phase of testicular inactivity triggered an increase in body weight, the onset of the spring moult and testicular recrudescence in this short-day breeder. These results support the hypothesis that in mink all photoperiodic signals are conveyed by the pineal gland. But although the pineal seems essential for the seasonal timing of the cycles, it does not modify the events themselves once they are initiated.

AB  - Luteal phase abnormalities in early menstrual cycles after pregnancy have been shown to cause confusion in the practice of natural family planning (NFP) for some patients and to restrict severely the number of late infertile days available to others. The cause of the abnormalities is uncertain but appears to be related to the nursing status of the patient.
Over a 6-year period, 1975-80, all patients who requested instruction in the use of natural family planning (NFP) after pregnancy were offered the opportunity of collating their family planning observations with the results of urinary hormone assays. Participants were asked to record the basal body temperature (BBT) each morning at the same time and at the same body site before arising or imbibing fluid, hot or cold. At night, on retiring, patients were asked to record the mucus signs experienced during the day. The observations recorded were the basic patterns of dryness, of infertile or of fertile mucus, and the transitions between patterns of mucus signs. It was recommended that charts be commenced immediately on returning home after an abortion and within 3 or 4 weeks of term delivery. 24 hour urine collections were assayed for total estrogen and pregnanediol excretion commencing on day 7 for postabortion patients, at 4 weeks for nonlactating postpartum patients, and from 6 weeks for nursing mothers. Participants also were asked to collect urine specimens immediately before ovulation as predicted by the peak mucus sign and again 3-4 days after the temperature rise. The charted mucus signs and BBT observations were examined analogically with the results of the urinary hormone assays and a marginal line, separating the preovulatory from the higher postovulatory BBT, was drawn at the completion of each cycle. Patients were free to remain in the study for as long as they wished, that is, until they were confident that they could practice NFP without further supervision or until planned or unplanned pregnancies occurred. Postovulatory levels of total estrogen excretion greater than the preovulatory peak values occurred in a number of participants. Luteal phases longer than 16 days were found in 6 patients during the study period. A short luteal phase was common in all groups, especially in the 1st post-pregnancy cycle. The important finding was the wide scatter of preovulatory estrogen excretion levels before the 1st postpartum ovualtion, especially in lactating women, yet the mean levels of estrogen excretion were generally greater in non-breastfeeding than in breastfeeding women. Abnormal BBT charts were restricted to cycles with short luteal phases. The position of the marginal line on the BBT charts was stable over the first 3 cycles in 106 of 197 (54%) participants and inconstant in 91 (46%). No significant difference was found in the incidence of constant or variable levels of the marginal line in the successful and unsuccessful participants.

AB  - Many centrally acting drugs which are prescribed for hypertension, depression, epilepsy, insomnia and asthma may also affect fetal brain neurotransmission and behavioral states. Nearly all these drugs enter the fetal circulation following maternal administration. The immaturity of the blood-brain barrier and greater accumulation in the developing brain make the fetal brain a major target of its mother's medication. Adverse effects that are seen in the fetus are not necessarily evident in its mother. The authors have shown that drugs like clonidine (an antihypertensive) and clomipramine (an antidepressant), which act on noradrenaline and serotonin neurotransmission in the brain, suppress rapid eye movement sleep in the developing rat. In adulthood, the neonatally treated rats showed hyperactivity, hyperanxiety, reduced sexual behavior, disturbed sleep patterns, and reduced cerebral cortical size. Furthermore, such treatment induced an increase in voluntary alcohol consumption and a decreased adaptability of responses to changes in water deprivation in a Y-maze. Little is known about long-lasting consequences of centrally acting drugs used during late gestation in humans. Minor neurological disturbances, such as delayed visual motor performance, smaller head circumference, increased anxiety and disturbed sleep-wake patterns, have been reported in children born to hypertensive mothers treated with clonidine or alpha-methyl-dopa.

AB  - Pregnant albino rats were exposed to nitrogen dioxide in concentrations of 0.05, 0.10, 1 and 10 mg/m3 for 6 hr each day throughout gestation. Postnatal viability, growth, physical maturation, neuromotor development, and biochemical parameters indicative of NO 2 oxidizing effects were studied in progeny up to the age of 3 months. It was found that although viability and physical development were little affected (only at 10 mg/m3), dose-dependent neurobehavioral deviations (such as disturbances in early neuromotor development, coordination deficits, retarded development of locomotion, reduced activity and reactivity) were induced by the lower exposures. The reduction in motor activity was found to persist into the postweaning period.

AB  - This discussion identifies some of the health problems experienced by rural women in Africa. The first of these health problems is malaria, which is not exclusively reserved for rural women. Yet, it is they who are most exposed to bites by the mosquitoes which abound more particularly in that country. So involved are they in their daily tasks, they often do not even feel these bites, and negligence and/or lack of information prevents them from taking antimalarial drugs. Only when fever or tenacious headaches occur do they decide to take a few nivaquine pills. Often they simply drink medicinal herb teas said to be "diuretic." Next on the list is malnutrition, with anemia as its corollary. It is caused by ignorance, or lack of information on what food should be eaten; dietary customs and taboos deeply anchored in some families and which deprive women of the nutrients required by their bodies, especially after childbirth; lack of time; and financial difficulties. The problems of malaria and malnutrition affect men and children as well as women, but others are specific to women. Closely spaced pregnancies, which used to be rare in villages, are now increasingly frequent in rural areas. Since planned parenthood is "unknown" in rural areas, most women bear a great many children -- 8-10 or more. Placenta previa is a frequent condition in such women, and often results in the mother's death, sinc the delivery was done in a poorly equipped center and the diagnosis was only made at the beginning of labor. Since women are constantly concerned with doing the most for their family and satisfying all of their needs, they never rest during the day, are excessively tired, and only sleep 5-6 hours a night. In addition to their own specific health problems, mothers often are obliged to spend their nights watching, alone, over 1 or more sick children. In sum, these are some of the everyday problems encountered in rural areas: the lack of information on health matters; the distance from health centers; limited financial resources in the rural population; and the precariousness of means of transportation, and the absence of an emergency transferral system.

AB  - The paper discusses fetal and neonatal energy expenditure. The extent of the variation in fetal energy expenditure is unknown, but calculations are presented to show that an average value may be around 18 kcal/kg X d, with the oxidative cost of growth being about 13% of the total. In the neonatal period there is apparently a large variation in total daily energy expenditure, perhaps as great as 70%. This is accounted for partly by methodological difficulties, but also by genetic variation in resting metabolism, and by variation in activity, nutritional state, growth rate and body composition. Data are presented from the literature to give some guidance as to the variability of energy expenditure at different weights and postnatal ages.

AB  - Two hundred and twenty-three case records of patients with toxaemia of pregnancy were analysed in order to try to establish the ability to predict through clinical and biological assessments of the mother the prognosis for the fetus. Statistical analysis methods were chosen to work out the classification of the parameters and to lead to an index of severity that could be established by multifactorial discriminating analysis. This study confirms that there is an inversion in the circadian rhythm of arterial blood pressure, with an increase in the evening and at night. It shows how bad prognostically blood pressure instability is. On the other hand oedema of the legs is of no significance. Contrary to the view that has been held for a long time, an increase in weight is directly proportional to fetal parameters. As far as parameters are concerned as a whole (both clinical and biological) a rise in blood urea is more discriminating at every stage of the illness and precedes an increase in the platelet count, the changes in creatinine clearance and night blood pressure. Maternal changes are better correlated with fetal variability before the 35th week of pregnancy whereas after that date the prognostic value of these readings is of little importance.

AB  - Twenty women with abnormal glucose tolerance, detected from a routine program of antenatal screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at 28 wk, were admitted for 24-h metabolic profiles. They were then alternately allocated to either insulin and dietary restriction or dietary restriction alone and then retested 4 wk later while on therapy. Ten normal controls were assessed twice at similar gestations to the study group. Before treatment, the 20 gestational diabetic subjects had higher mean concentrations of plasma glucose and 3-hydroxybutyrate than the controls for most of the profile, but mean insulin values were similar. Insulin therapy was associated with a reduction in mean glucose concentrations so that the profile was similar to the controls, while in the diet-alone group the reduction was less. The 3-hydroxybutyrate concentrations rose between profiles in the normal group and also rose in those treated by diet alone, but still remained within the upper range of normal even at night. Insulin therapy resulted in a similar 3-hydroxybutyrate profile to the controls. The C-peptide response to breakfast was reduced in both groups to levels below that of the controls. Neonatal outcome indices were similar in the two treatment groups, despite the differences in maternal metabolites, but because of the size of this study, conclusions about the neonate must be tentative.

Thirty-four unanethesized, unrestrained pregnant Hartley guinea pigs were studied 1 to 14 days following surgical procedures. Twelve neonatal animals instrumented during the first week of life were studied at 3 to 30 days. Spontaneous, undifferentiated electrocortical activity was recorded from the youngest fetuses studied, with high-voltage slow activity appearing at 50 days' gestation. Cycling electrocortical activity and sleep spindles could be observed in the late-term fetal and neonatal animals, with rapid eye movements and behavioral state defined in the latter. Power spectral analysis demonstrated more predominant delta activity, faster beta frequencies, and better-developed sleep spindles in the neonatal animal as compared to the fetus. © 1985.

AB  - We have studied the effects of prenatal protein malnutrition on development of the hippocampal and frontal cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Using power spectral analyses in rats of several age groups we found that protein malnutrition, instituted prenatally and continued postnatally, produces marked alterations in power spectral measures, i.e., alterations in peak theta frequency in the hippocampus during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Peak theta frequency was found to be significantly retarded in malnourished animals, especially during the preweaning period of development. Protein malnutrition, therefore, appears to affect mechanisms responsible for generating the tonic component of theta activity.

AB  - Reanalyses of a number of studies of self-reported mood indicate that Positive and Negative Affect consistently emerge as the first two Varimax rotated dimensions in orthogonal factor analyses or as the first two second-order factors derived from oblique solutions. The two factors emerged with varying sets of descriptors and were even replicated in several data sets characterized by possible methodological problems noted by earlier writers (acquiescence response bias, inappropriate response formats, and so on). The results thus strongly attest to the stability and robustness of Positive and Negative Affect in self-report. Because this same two-dimensional configuration has also been consistently identified in all of the other major lines of mood research, it is now firmly established as the basic structure of English-language affect at the general factor level. © 1985 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Work in recent years has revealed that prolactin can no longer be considered exclusively as a lactation hormone, and must be seen in a much wider physiological perspective. Biochemical and pharmacological studies in animals have made a special contribution, and prolactin is becoming increasingly important in toxicological investigations. The general custom of using rats for such studies has its own inherent problems, involving both the analytical methodology and the special requirements that must be observed in the housing and handling of these experimental animals. The aim of workshop conference was to review these special problems, together with our present knowledge of the mechanisms of prolactin secretion, and to present examples of pharmacological and toxicological studies on prolactin. Döhler (Hannover) spoke on the effect of experimental and pre-experimental conditions on the results of prolactin determination in rats. He described in detail the influence of sex, age and animal strain, and of biological rhythms. Alongside these physiological factors, however, a very great influence is exerted by the conditions of housing, and any external interference leads to often dramatic alterations in prolactin secretion. Wuttke (Göttingen) discussed the mechanisms of prolactin secretion in the rat. Here, dopamine holds a key position. This is also pharmacologically important, because prolactin secretion is stimulated by all dopamine antagonists and inhibited by all dopamine agonists. Vasointestinal polypeptide (VIP) and thyroliberin (TRH) stimulate prolactin secretion directly. The contribution by Nagy (Budapest) dealt with prolactin secretion in lactating rats and its modification by various transmitters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Female golden-mantled ground squirrels were pinealectomized (Pinx) or Sham-Pinx at 70 days of age and maintained for more than 2 yr at 23 degrees C in a 10:14 light-dark photoperiod. Reproductive condition and body weight were recorded weekly and bi-weekly, respectively. Pinx and Sham-Pinx squirrels displayed circannual rhythms in body weight; the groups did not differ with respect to absolute magnitudes of annual peaks and troughs in body mass. The period of the circannual body weight cycle (measured peak to peak) was 27 and 58 days shorter in Pinx than in Sham-Pinx squirrels during the 1st and 2nd yr, respectively, after surgery. The onset of estrus during the second postoperative cycle occurred significantly earlier in Pinx than in Sham-Pinx squirrels. The pineal gland is not essential for the generation or expression of circannual or circadian cycles but may affect the period of some circannual rhythms.

Ovariectomy on diestrous day 1 eliminated the PRL surge completely, and injection of 100 μg polyestradiol phosphate, a long-acting estrogen, not only maintained the surge, but amplified and prolonged it. Bilateral implantation of an estradiol (E2)-containing cannula [diluted 1:4 with cholesterol (C)] in the medial preoptic area (MPO), but not in the cerebral cortex (CC), also maintained the surge. In long term ovariectomized rats, bilateral implantation of E2-containing cannulae (1:5, 1:10, 1:20, and 1:200) in the corticomedial amygdala (CMA) or ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus or a singular implantation in the third ventricle failed to induce a PRL surge 12 days later. Similar singular implantation in the anterior pituitary (AP) increased the basal levels of plasma PRL compared to those in C-implanted controls, but no surge was evident. Only bilateral implantation of E2 in the MPO induced a small but significant rise of plasma PRL at 1700 and 1900 h. Using higher concentration implants with a higher E2 concentration (1:4) in the MPO and sampling at shorter intervals, significant afternoon PRL surges were induced on days 2–4. However, systemic effects of E2, i.e. vaginal cornification and uterine weight enlargement, were also evident. Similar implants in other brain regions had the same results. Further increasing the E2 to C dilution from 1:10 to 1:200 eliminated the systemic effect of E2 implants, while the PRL surge-inducing ability persisted. It appears that the highest diluted E2 implants (1:150 and 1:200) gave the highest PRL response and persisted for the greatest number of days. Using the highly diluted E2 implants (1:100 and 1:200) in various brain regions, the MPO and the ventromedial hypothalamus were the most sensitive areas in inducing the PRL surge; the other areas studied, including suprachiasmatic nuclei, CMA, AP, and CC were ineffective. In conclusion, highly diluted E2 implants in the brain appear to be effective in obtaining a specific effect on the afternoon PRL surge; the CMA, suprachiasmatic nuclei, AP, and CC are not estrogen feedback sites for the induction of PRL release, and the MPO was the most sensitive area of the estrogen action in the brain regions examined for the induction of the afternoon PRL surge. © 1985 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The authors suggest an indirect evaluation of the electrocortical activity of the fetus by looking at evidence of cyclical variations in fetal cardiac rhythm. These show up by periodic changes in the variability of the rhythm. The narrow association that has been established between small changes in episodes of cardiac rhythm and deep sleep - which is itself evidence of satisfactory cortical development - make this type of tracing, under certain conditions, an excellent sign of fetal well being. This means that the value of small variabilities in fetal heart rhythm takes on greater importance as a prognostic feature.

AB  - After prenatal exposure to diazepam (Valium), mature rats at 4 months of age displayed slow wave sleep (SWS) electroencephalographic patterns indicating impaired synchronization and SWS mechanisms. These animals spent a much greater portion of their SWS in the lighter SWS I, as compared to the control group which showed a predominance of the deeper SWS II. At one year of age, the diazepam-exposed rats had much fewer diazepam-specific binding sites in the thalamus than the vehicle-exposed controls. These results provide first evidence for a physiological role for benzodiazepine receptors by showing that prenatal exposure to diazepam has an enduring and detrimental effect on their ontogenesis and sleep mechanisms. © 1985.

AB  - In the spring-born lamb, puberty, the onset of repetitive ovarian cycles, occurs between 25 and 35 weeks of age during the decreasing day length of autumn. This study was conducted to determine the photoperiod conditions required for puberty. Several artificial photoperiod treatments were used, beginning from birth or soon after. Continuous exposure to long days or to short days delayed the first normal luteal cycle beyond 1 yr of age. Similarly, a single block of 4 or 10 weeks of long days at early ages, from either 3-7 of 3-13 weeks of age (afterwards under short days), produced only a few consecutive cycles within the first year after birth. However, exposure to blocks of long days at later ages resulted in the onset of cycles during the normal pubertal period. Lambs that experienced a 10-week block of long days (12-22 weeks of age; otherwise under short days) began reproductive cycles at 34 weeks of age. Reduction of the single block of long days to 5 weeks (17-22 weeks of age) or 1 week (week 22 of age) also resulted in the onset of normal luteal cycles within the normal age range for puberty. The results indicate that a sequence of long days followed by short days is required to initiate and sustain ovulatory cycles at the normal age in the lamb. Moreover, the age when long days are experienced is important, with later exposure to long days being more effective in producing consecutive cycles than early exposure to long days. These findings raise the possibility that the springborn lamb uses a portion of the long days of summer to time the onset of puberty during the short day lengths of autumn. © 1985 by The Endocrine Society.

We examined the fetal breathing effects of upward change in plasma glucose (after intravenous glucose administration) and downward change (after intravenous insulin administration) at two different times of day (8 am and 4 pm) at both 24 and 36 weeks of gestation. No change in the percent of time spent in fetal breathing was seen after insulin infusion. Fetal breathing increased after glucose infusion at 36 weeks of gestation but not at 24 weeks. Responses did not differ between tests performed at 8 am and 4 pm. © 1985.

AB  - In a prospective study estriol, estradiol, progesterone, human placental lactogen (HPL), prolactin and SP1 (a placental glycoprotein specific for pregnancy) concentrations were calculated in the second half of uncomplicated pregnancies in order to answer the question if there exists a circadian rhythm of these hormones in serum. All serum concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassays at 8.00, 10.00, 16.00, 20.00, 24.00 and 4.00 o'clock. 58 pregnant women with uncomplicated pregnancies show no circardian rhythm of serum levels of estriol, progesterone, HPL and SP1, while serum levels of estradiol and prolactin have significant circadian rhythm. The estradiol serum levels are significantly higher at 8.00 and 12.00 o'clock, and significantly lower at 24.00 and 4.00 o'clock. The prolactin serum levels are significant lower at 16.00 and 20.00 and at 4.00 and 8.00 significantly higher. In 20 pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia and 12 pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth retardation serum levels of all hormones were measured at 8.00, 10.00, 16.00, 20.00, 24.00 and 4.00 o'clock. The serum concentrations in complicated pregnancies show no difference from the serum levels in uncomplicated pregnancies.

AB  - Several experiments were conducted to evaluate serum cortisol concentrations and the circadian rhythm of this hormone in gilts tethered in stalls. Control animals were penned individually. In the initial experiment, 18 nongravid gilts were placed in tether stalls after being in either tether stalls or individual pens for 2 wk. No significant differences were found in serum cortisol concentrations. In a second experiment, 16 ovariectomized gilts were placed in tether stalls or individual pens for up to 5 wk. Estrus was induced during wk 3 and 4. During the first day in tether stalls, serum cortisol concentrations increased (P less than .05) and the circadian rhythm of cortisol was disrupted for 4 d. During estrus, the circadian rhythm of cortisol was interrupted for several days in the gilts, regardless of housing. After 4 wk, morning concentrations of cortisol were higher for gilts in tether stalls. The results indicate that: 1) the initial response to tethering varies according to previous penning and handling experience, 2) although the circadian rhythm of cortisol was either altered or disrupted during estrus, such disruptions were not influenced by type of penning and 3) tether stalls may chronically increase cortisol concentrations in gilts.

During anoestrus wheel-running was restricted to the hours of illumination, but during oestrus extended into the dark period and was increased overall, with the number of wheel revolutions being doubled or trebled. In spayed females wheel-running was mostly limited to the light periods. © 1985.

AB  - Two temporal variables have been implicated in the timing of postpartum heat in Norway rats: time of day and time since parturition. The nature of the interaction between these variables is not clearly understood. We extend previous observations on this problem to freely behaving animals continuously videotaped during parturition and postpartum mating in a seminatural habitat. The timing of postpartum mating is best described by a model in which an interval timer is coupled to a circadian gating mechanism. Interactions between circadian and interval timing mechanisms may be widespread in the neuroendocrine control of behavior. © 1985.

AB  - Human prolactin (PRL) has been related to various pathologic disorders known to be associated with osmoregulation and hypertension. In this study, we compared changes in plasma PRL concentrations in normal pregnant patients to those in patients with severe pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). Comparison of plasma PRL concentrations collected antepartum, at delivery, and 48 hours postpartum failed to distinguish women with PIH from those without. Only women with PIH, however, showed a significant rise in systemic PRL concentrations between admission to the study and delivery. Antepartum abnormalities in plasma PRL concentrations associated with PIH may not have been detected because of diurnal variations in PRL secretion. © 1985 Southern Medical Association.

AB  - The authors tested the relationship between psychosocial childbearing stress factors and metabolic control in a research sample of 39 pregnant insulin-dependent diabetic women. Subjects were selected using rigorous exclusion criteria from a population of more than 200 pregnant diabetic patients assessed in a University National Institutes of Health Center. Metabolic control was determined by plasma levels of preprandial day, night, and early morning fasting glucose, urinary ketones, and glycosylation of hemoglobin. Differences in plasma glucose concentrations and urinary ketone levels at several times during the day and night were associated with psychosocial stress factors. A similar relationship between stress and levels of diabetic control could not be demonstrated by hemoglobin Ai assay, a result contradicting most prior studies of adolescent populations. These findings are compatible with a biopsychosocial model of diabetes mellitus and emphasize the importance of using several different measures of diabetic control to determine stress-control relationships. © 1985 by The Williams & Wilkins Co.

AB  - Multiunit activity (MUA) of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and medial preoptic area (MPOA) was recorded in chronically implanted, freely moving female rats. The integrated MUA of the SCN and MPOA was significantly higher in the dark than in the light period of day. Superimposed upon this diurnal rhythmicity in the SCN were 3.0- to 3.5-hour ultradian oscillations of MUA, with the fluctuations showing the highest variability at night. A significant increase in SCN MUA consistently preceded the offset of light by 1 h, whereas during the dark-light transition a marked decrease of neuronal firing occurred after the onset of light. Analysis of MUA base level recorded during slow wave sleep - revealed that the average activity in the SCN was lowest on the day of diestrus-II, began to increase on proestrus night, and reached the highest values during estrus. Bilateral transection of the optic nerve, 4-6 weeks prior to electrical recordings, abolished the estrous cycle and the circadian pattern of neuronal firing of the SCN. An ultradian oscillation of integrated MUA in blind rats occurred with the same average intervals (3.0-3.28 h) but the amplitude was much higher than in intact cycling rats. Data indicate that there are correlated changes in basal MUA levels of the SCN and the stages of the estrous cycle. Furthermore, they suggest that maintenance of hormonal cyclicity and circadian rhythm of neuronal function requires intact retinohypothalamic connections. © 1985 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Mean plasma corticosterone levels of A/J mice rise from nonpregnant levels of 20.4 μg% to 40.6 μg% on day 11 and 167.11 μg% on day 14 of pregnancy. These changes in mean steroid levels are associated with proportionally increased diurnal swings. This suggests that the control mechanisms for diurnal swings respond in a proportional, rather than an absolute, way in regulating plasma hormone levels. Large diurnal hormone swings may be teratogenic or facilitate teratogenesis. The rules of receptor physiology may have wide application to the understanding of teratogenic risk.

AB  - There is a daily rhythm in the production of the pineal hormone melatonin in all mammalian species. Production is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light. This provides a signal reflecting the changing environmental lighting cycle. In seasonally breeding mammals that use changes in the photoperiod to time their reproductive cycles, temporal signals to the reproductive system are controlled by the daily rhythm in melatonin production.

Mothers and pups in constant light, however, gained less weight than their counterparts in the light-dark cycle. While mothers did not differ in their total daily contact time or daily bout frequency, the distribution of the contact time was shifted in constant light. These data may be consistent with the idea that mothers maintain a free-running rhythm under such conditions. © 1985.

AB  - Summary. The circulating concentrations of placental protein 10 (PP10) were measured by radioimmunoassay in 288 women with normal pregnancy and ten women (55 samples) with cholestasis of pregnancy. Serum PP10 levels were not affected by changes in incubation and storage temperature, and no diurnal variation was observed. The highest PP10 levels (36–85 μg/1) in normal pregnancy were found at 34 weeks. The postpartum decline of serum PP10 concentration corresponded to an average half‐life of 18h. In cholestasis of pregnancy at 32–39 weeks, the serum PP10 levels were found to be lower than normal. Negative correlation was observed between aminotransferase and PP10 levels in serum and between the bile acid levels and the PP10 concentration. These results suggest that the severity of maternal liver disorder is reflected in the circulating PP10 concentration. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Between March 1 and Sept 1, 1980, we interviewed a 25% random sample of patients admitted to medicine, surgery, and obstetric, and gynecology services to determine the frequency and descriptive characteristics of night sweats (NS). Seventy-two (41%) of 174 patients interviewed reported NS within three months before admission. Obstetric patients reported NS significantly more often than nonobstetric patients (60% vs 33%, P <.02). The duration of NS ranged from one day to 27 years (mean 10.5 months; median two months). NS were mild in 36 (50%), moderate in 17 (24%), and severe in 19 (26%). Severe NS were reported significantly more often by nonobstetric patients, and most often by those on the medicine service. Among nonobstetric patients, NS were associated with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland, and severe NS with the use of antipyretics. NS were not associated with elevated temperature measurements during hospitalization. © 1985 Southern Medical Association.

AB  - Mating induces two daily surges of prolactin (PRL) secretion in the rat. Termination of the diurnal and nocturnal surges coincides with the development of the placenta and the secretion of rat placental lactogen (RPL). The number of conceptuses present was altered to induce changes in RPL levels in the blood. The presence of one intact viable conceptus is sufficient to cause termination of the diurnal PRL surge. The presence of one or zero conceptuses allowed resumption of the nocturnal surge after day 14, whereas presence of two or more conceptuses prevented the surge. Hysterectomy on day 14 allowed the resumption of the nocturnal PRL surges for 2 days and diurnal PRL surges for 3 days. Progesterone treatment stimulated an additional third nocturnal PRL surge and blunted the magnitude of the resuming diurnal surges. It is concluded that secretions from the conceptus and progesterone contribute to the regulation of prolactin during pregnancy.

AB  - A few analogues of LHRH have been tested in the adult bonnet monkeys using change in serum testosterone following LHRH injection as a parameter of response to LHRH. Of the four analogues tested in male monkeys, Buserelin was found to be the most potent one in increasing serum testosterone levels. Injection of the LHRH antagonist at 1600 h resulted in the abolition of the characteristic nocturnal surge of testosterone observed in adult bonnet monkeys maintained under regulated light conditions. Following administration of LHRH a/s during early pregnancy, serum chorionic gonadotropin levels decreased though the course of pregnancy was not affected. These results suggest that bonnet monkey can be successfully employed to test LHRH analogues. © 1985 Pergamon Press Ltd.

AB  - Stereotaxic surgery was performed on sheep fetuses at 108 to 110 days of gestation to investigate hypothalamic influences on fetal growth hormone (GH) release. In 5 fetuses the median eminence was destroyed, in 6 damage was confined to the medial basal hypothalamus without total destruction of the median eminence, 6 had misplaced lesions and 4 were sham operated controls. Destruction of the median eminence led to a marked fall in GH secretion and an abolition of pulsatile GH release. Following lesioning of the median eminence, GH values are comparable to resting levels in the infant lamb. Pituitary infarction was excluded in these fetuses both histologically and by a maintained GH response to exogenous growth hormone releasing factor. Lesions of the medial basal hypothalamus without destruction of the median eminence led to a significant but lesser fall in GH secretion and a reduction in the pulsatility of GH release. Sham operated fetuses and those with lesions misplaced outside the endocrine hypothalamus showed maintained high circulating GH concentrations with marked pulsatility of GH release. These studies demonstrate that fetal GH release is solely dependent upon hypothalamic stimulation presumably mediated by growth hormone releasing factor. There is no evidence for pituitary autonomy or for direct extrahypothalamic stimulation of the fetal somatotrope.

AB  - Lactoferrin was measured in breast milk from Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australian women using an enzyme immunoassay. There was no diurnal variation in lactoferrin concentration or change in concentration between the beginning and end of a feed. Lactoferrin levels were significantly higher in the first 15 days postpartum than in the period after the 15th day. Regression analysis showed that in milk from Aboriginal women less than 15 days postpartum, higher concentrations of lactoferrin were associated with weight for height (WFH) greater than 90% and with increased parity. Comparable data were not available for Caucasian women. For Aboriginal and Caucasian women more than 15 days postpartum, lactoferrin concentrations were higher in women greater than 90% WFH. Other variables, such as parity, were not significant in the regression. © 1985 Raven Press, New York.

AB  - Ten cows in early stages of lactation (less than 100 days postpartum) were used to test the effect of sprinkler/fan cooling on vaginal temperature patterns. Cows were assigned to two groups matched according to milk production. The trial was divided into three periods: period 1, when one group was treated and the other group was not, period 2, when neither group was treated, and period 3, when treatment was switched from period 1 between groups. Treatment consisted of forced air misting in a pre-milking holding pen, fan cooling during milking, and forced air-sprinkling in a postmilking holding area. Weather conditions were measured by dry bulb, wet bulb, and black globe temperatures. Black globe temperatures in pre- and postmilking holding areas were used to estimate treatment magnitude. All measures were obtained through radiotelemetry at 15-min intervals for 31 days. Animals were milked twice a day. Animals spent an average of 140 min in treatment at each milking. In both morning and afternoon milking, treatment caused a transient increase of body temperature. However, this was followed in the afternoon by low vaginal temperatures for 1 to 2 h beyond treatment with lower temperatures throughout the day. © 1985, American Dairy Science Association.

AB  - We examined, in Mongolian gerbils, the adequacy of two commonly used indices of rate of development, age at eye‐opening and age at vaginal introitus, as predictors of biologically important events: initiation of feeding on solid food and age at first parturition. We then enquired as to the interrelationships among body weight, eye‐opening, and vaginal introitus in Mongolian gerbils whose rates of development were manipulated by altering the extent of their exposure to illumination during ontogeny. We found that (1) age at vaginal introitus was significantly, but weakly, correlated with age at first parturition (Experiment I); (2) age at eye‐opening strongly predicted age of initiation of gnawing on solid food (Experiment II); (3) eye‐opening occurred at markedly different ages, but at the same body weight in gerbils reared under 0/24‐, 6/18‐, 12/12‐, and 24/0‐hr day–night cycles (Experiment III); and (4) vaginal introitus occurred at both different ages and different body weights in females reared under different day–night cycles (Experiment III).

AB  - To determine responses to abomasal protein infusion and ruminal acetate: propionate ratios, four lactating Toggenburg goats fed hourly a 70% roughage and 30% concentrate diet were used in a Latin-square design with a factorial arrangement of treatments. Either acetate or propionate was infused ruminally and casein or saline infused abomasally. Estimated net energy and volume of the infusates were similar for all treatments. To examine the effects of treatments on glucose metabolism, 2-carbon-14 propionate was infused ruminally and 6-hydrogen-3 glucose was infused intravenously for 9 and 5 h, respectively. Although glucose concentration in plasma was higher and propionate turnover greater with propionate treatment, percentage of glucose derived from propionate, amount of propionate coverted to glucose, and glucose turnover remained unchanged. No differences in glucose metabolism due to the abomasal casein infusion were evident. To determine the effects of treatment on insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, and prolactin in plasma, samples were collected at 10-min intervals for 3 h at 0400 and 1600 h. No diurnal variation or consistent peaks were observed for any of the hormones nor were treatment effects on plasma concentrations of insulin, growth hormone, or prolactin evident. Glucagon concentration was higher with casein treatment; however, no relationship existed between glucagon in plasma and glucogenic parameters measured. © 1985, American Dairy Science Association.

AB  - To determine the acute and chronic effects of suckling on maternal PRL secretion in monkeys, five motherinfant pairs were studied longitudinally on days 40, 80, 120, and 10 after weaning (day 160). Mothers were chronically cannulated and, during blood collections, wore protective nylon vests with mobile tethers. Studies were undertaken during the day and night with the mother and infant undisturbed, during the daytime, before and after the removal of the infant, and during the day and night before and after the reunion of mother and infant. Maternal PRL levels were significantly (P < 0.05) higher at night than during the day in undisturbed mother-infant pairs. This nocturnal elevation was probably induced by a more intensive interaction of the mother and infant at night than during the day. Basal PRL concentrations in samples collected during these undisturbed settings significantly (P < 0.05) declined as the postpartum interval continued. The removal of the infant did not perturb maternal PRL patterns. Typically, after reunion of mother and infant, maternal PRL levels were increased significantly (P < 0.05), reaching maximal levels approximately 2 h after reunion. If PRL secretion, induced by the suckling stimulus, is instrumental in sustaining puerperal infertility, then the increased secretion of PRL that occurs at night during the protracted interval of intense mother-infant interaction may be of particular significance in inhibition of the hypothalamicpituitary-ovarian axis. © 1985 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - This chapter discusses the organization, characteristics, release, and modulation of hypophyseal and other endocrinologically relevant pools of opioid peptides and their possible target sites and functions. The nature and role of opioid mechanisms in the control of the endocrine secretion of various tissues are considered in the chapter. Many conditions—for example, stress, nutritional status, degree of hydration, and phase of circadian or estrus cyclicity—have biochemically been shown to be (1) associated with alterations in the activity of endocrine-like opioid systems and (2) related to opioid-mediated changes in behavioral, physiological, and endocrinological measures. It is the unification of these complementary sources of information and the assignation of particular functions to particular endocrine-like pools of opioids that are of importance. The chapter also discusses a particular aspect of the function of opioid mechanisms, including endocrine-like opioid peptide systems—that is, of their modulation of the secretion of hormones into the systemic circulation. The ability of opioids to modify these endocrine parameters is among their most striking properties and, especially in the case of antagonists, no less impressive than their role in antinociceptive processes. There are multifarious sites of attack and mechanisms of action by which opioid mechanisms may modulate endocrine secretion. Similarly, a diversity of opioid ligands and receptor types is implicated in particular cases. An elucidation of the roles of individual ligands and receptor types at specific loci and their relationships to other control systems under specific conditions has not been achieved. © 1985, Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mitotic activity in ovarian follicles was studied in relation to the size of the follicles during a 24-hour period (10.00, 16.00, 22.00 and 04.00 h) throughout the estrous cycle of the wild bandicoot rat (Bandicota bengalensis) to ascertain the cell proliferation rate and its 24-hour rhythm in the follicular tissue. In the bandicoot ovary, mitotic activity in the granulosa and thecal cells was highest in the follicles ranging from 201 to 400 μm in diameter. During the estrous cycle, mitotic activity of the granulosa cells was highest at estrus in follicles <601 μm, and at diestrus in follicles >600 μm; while the mitotic trough was at proestrus in all the follicles. Thecal mitosis was significantly lower than mitosis of the granulosa cells. In most of the follicles, mitotic activity in the thecal cells was highest at diestrus and lowest at metestrus. In both the granulosa and thecal cells, the timing of mitotic peaks and troughs varied according to the size of the follicles and the stages of the estrous cycle. In the granulosa cells mitotic peaks were maximal in the daytime (10.00 h, 16.00 h) and in some cases at night (04.00 h); and mitotic troughs were primarily during the night (22.00 h, 04.00 h) and in some cases in the day (10.00 h). In the thecal cells, however, mitotic activity in most of the follicles was distinctly higher in the daytime (16.00 h) than at night (22.00 h, i.e., evening). Thus, a prominent 24-hour mitotic rhythm was noticed in the ovarian follicles of the bandicoot rat.

AB  - 1. The milk production of one mother was determined post-partum for a period of 13 weeks, during which time breast milk was her infant's only source of food energy. The weight changes of both the mother and the male infant were recorded during this period. 2. The food intake and activity pattern of the mother were also recorded for 4-week periods: at 2, 6, 10 weeks after birth and 2 weeks after the cessation of lactation, which was maintained for a period of 27 weeks. 3. The infant regained his birth weight of 3310 g on the 14th day of life. His weight gain for the duration of the study, which averaged 233 g/week, was considered satisfactory. 4. The daily milk production increased gradually from an average of 241 g during the 1st week post-partum to 995 g during the 12th week. The infant's maximum milk intake and hence food energy intake per kg body-weight was (range) 198–204 g milk and 550–560 kJ/kg respectively during the 3rd to the 7th week, followed by a gradual decrease from the 8th to the 13th week after birth. 5. The estimated efficiency of energy coversion for breast-milk production was consistent with other values reported in the literature. © 1985, The Nutrition Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Female golden hamsters exposed to short photoperiods become anestrous and exhibit daily surges of gonadotropins and progesterone. Since little is known about the transition between the cycling and anovulatory states, the following experiments were done to determine whether there are hormonal changes that precede cessation of estrous cyclicity. Females killed on the morning of estrus, up to the tenth estrous cycle in short days, showed no hormonal or ovarian morphologic evidence of changes in reproductive function. When assessed on the afternoon of estrus, however, serum levels of luteinizing hormone and progesterone increased significantly before vaginal and ovarian cyclicity ceased. Females sampled in both the morning and afternoon at increasing durations since their last vaginal estrus revealed that maximal daily surges of both gonadotropins and progesterone were not consistently manifested until the vaginal cycle had been absent for 2 weeks. By then, estrogen levels and uterine weights were low and ovaries showed hypertrophied interstitia and arrested follicular growth. We have demonstrated that there are hormonal changes in females before the loss of the vaginal cycle and onset of major daily hormonal surges. Our results suggest that alterations in feedback relationships between steroid hormones and gonadotropins may precede photoperiod-induced anestrus.

AB  - The secretions from developed concept in the rat appear to inhibit both the rhythmic nocturnal secretion of prolactin (Prl) during the second half of pregnancy and the neurally mediated Prl release in response to suckling stimulation. In order to identify the parts of the concepti capable of inhibiting Prl secretion, the components of the concepti were systematically removed and their effect on plasma Prl levels was examined. In the first experiment, female rats which were simultaneously pregnant and lactating were tested for Prl secretion in response to suckling stimulation after one of the following treatments: 1) removal of the foetuses only, 2) removal of the foetuses and trophoblasts, 3) removal of the complete concepti. In the second experiment, pregnant rats were tested for the presence of nocturnal Prl surges after either removal of the foetuses and trophoblasts or removal of the entire concepti. The results indicate that after removal of the foetuses alone, the inhibition of Prl secretion remains. Following removal of both the foetus and the trophoblast, leaving the decidua in situ with a supplementary progesterone implant, the decidua still retain a partial capacity to inhibit Prl secretion in response to suckling stimulation, while their inhibitory effect on the nocturnal Prl surges was very minute. Degeneration of the decidua occurred following the removal of the trophoblast, when no exogenous progesterone was supplied. The deterioration of the decidua or total removal of the concepti eliminates the entire inhibition of Prl secretion, both on the nocturnal surges as well as in response to suckling stimulation. Thus, it appears that after mid-pregnancy the trophoblast cell secretes a substance that both inhibits Prl secretion and maintains the corpus luteum, whereas the decidua at the same time secretes a substance that has a partial capacity to inhibit Prl secretion in response to suckling stimulation.

AB  - Naloxone, a specific opiate receptor antagonist, was used to evaluate the influence of endogenous opiate peptides on PRL secretion during various stages of the estrous cycle and after cervicovaginal stimulation. Naloxone (0.2 mg/kg, iv) administered at 0930 h suppressed basal 1000 h PRL levels on each day of the estrous cycle, but had no effect on the PRL surges occurring on the afternoon of proestrus and estrus. These afternoon surges could only be suppressed when naloxone was given immediately before the onset of the surge at 1330 h, suggesting a critical period for naloxone action. Later injections (at 1530 and 1730 h) had no further suppressive effects, although these injections suppressed the basal PRL secretion occurring during diestrous days I and II to near undetectable levels. In contrast, the immediate (1000 h) and afternoon PRL discharges triggered by cervicovaginal stimulation at 0930 h on proestrus, estrus, and diestrous day I were significantly suppressed by a single injection of naloxone, but only when it was administered before application of the stimulus. Moreover, this single naloxone injection significantly inhibited the long term PRL surges occurring during days 2 and 4 of pseudopregnancy in animals stimulated on estrus and diestrous day I. Naloxone treatment significantly shortened the duration of pseudopregnancy but did not prevent it, indicating that only minimal levels of PRL may be necessary to initiate and maintain pseudopregnancy. This striking difference in the time at which naloxone suppressed the stimulus-induced PRL discharges (compared to the spontaneous surges) suggests that endogenous opiate peptides also process the sensory information necessary for establishment of PRL surges during pseudopregnancy. The marked dependence of the spontaneous as well as the stimulus-induced PRL discharges on the stage of the estrous cycle support established evidence that ovarian steroids enhance endogenous opiate activity or facilitate the transfer of information along opiatergic pathways for the generation of PRL surges. © 1985 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The effect of daily melatonin administration was investigated in the immature female rat. Starting on day 15 of age, 100 µg melatonin were injected sc at different times of the day in animals housed in 12 h of light, 12 h of darkness or 16 h of light, 8 h of darkness. Melatonin given 9-11 h after the onset of light in both lighting regimens resulted in a 10-day delay of vaginal opening, a dissociation of the relation between vaginal opening and first proestrus, and a disruption of the initial estrous cycles. The same dose of melatonin given at other times during the photoperiod had no effect on sexual maturation. GnRH secretion in melatonin-treated animals was decreased, as judged by 30% lower pituitary GnRH receptor number in animals killed after opening of the vagina. During the diestrous phases, plasma levels of LH, FSH, and 17Β-estradiol were similar to those in control rats, but during proestrus, the surge of FSH was higher, and the peak of estradiol was higher and of a longer duration. This hormonal pattern suggests a build-up of hormones in secreting cells, which follows the lower incidence of proestrous phases in melatonin-treated rats. This build-up of FSH was indeed present, with higher concentrations in the pituitary during diestrus after melatonin treatment, while pituitaries removed during proestrus had lower contents of FSH. These results confirm that chronic melatonin administration delays sexual maturation of female rat, probably by retarding maturation of hypothalamic GnRH-producing cells. Thus, melatonin could modify basal GnRH secretion or pulsatile release. Pituitary and ovarian responsiveness do not seem to be affected, since proestrous surges of 17Β-estradiol, LH, and FSH occur, albeit at a reduced frequency. The results also show that there is a window of maximum sensitivity to administration of melatonin 9-11 h after the onset of light, and that this window of sensitivity is synchronized by the onset of light. This raises the possibility that the abnormal presence of endogenous melatonin during this period of the day could induce abnormal sexual development. © 1985 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Plasma prolactin levels were determined in heifers with regular oestrous cyclicity; two heifers were of the Swedish Red and White Breed and one was of the Swedish Friesian Breed. Blood was collected 24 times per day. The highest recorded plasma prolactin level was associated with oestrous behaviour. It was found that the lowest values were encountered during the afternoon and the highest at night. To study the relationship between progesterone levels and prolactin pattern, data from two untreated animals was pooled and fitted with a two‐ or three‐term Fourier curve. When applying the three‐term curve, the mean square for scatter was reduced to a level that was essentially random. Analysis of variance within the overall pattern of daily prolactin changes when the progesterone level exceeded 1.3 nmol/l revealed 24‐h, 12‐h and 8‐h rhythms. Maximal values for these rhythms were as follows: 24‐h at 1.30, 12‐h at 9.00 and 21.00, and 8‐h at 3.00, 11.00 and 19.00. The corresponding rhythms were represented by the following minimal values: 24‐h at 13.00, 12‐h at 3.00 and 15.00, and 8‐h at 7.00, 15.00 and 23.00. When progesterone was below 1.3 nmol/l, prolactin had only a 24‐h rhythm, with maximal values at 3.30 and minimal at 15.30. In the third heifer prolactin changes revealed 24‐h, 12‐h and 8‐h rhythms before manual enucleation of the corpus luteum on day 11, after which the rhythmicity changed and prolactin had only an 8‐h rhythm. Zirkadianer Rhythmus des Plasmaprolaktins bei Färsen Bei drei Färsen mit regelmäßigem Brunstzyklus wurden die Plasmaprolaktinspiegel bestimmt. Täglich wurden 24 Blutproben entnommen. Die höchsten Plasmaprolaktinwerte wurden während der Brunst gemessen. Die niedrigsten Werte wurden am Nachmittag, die höchsten in der Nacht beobachtet. Um die Zusammenhänge zwischen den Progesteronkonzentrationen und dem Prolaktinmuster zu untersuchen, wurden die Daten von 2 unbehandelten Tieren zusammengefaßt und einer zwei‐ bzw. dreiteiligen Fourier Kurve angepaßt. Bei Anwendung der dreiteiligen Kurve wurde das mittlere Quadrat der Streuung auf eine Größe reduziert, die als zufällig zu beurteilen war. Die Varianzanalyse der täglichen Prolaktinveränderungen bei Progesteronkonzentrationen von mehr als 1,3 nmol/l ergaben 24 h‐, 12 h‐ und 8 h‐Rhythmen. Folgende Maximalwerte dieser Rhythmen wurden festgestellt: 24‐h um 1.30, 12‐h um 9.00 und 21.00, und 8‐h um 3.00, 11.00 und 19.00 Uhr. Die entsprechenden Rhythmen waren durch folgende Minimalwerte gekennzeichnet: 24‐h um 13.00, 12‐h um 3.00 und 15.00 und 8‐h um 7.00, 15.00 und 23.00 Uhr. Bei Progesteronkonzentrationen von weniger als 1,3 nmol/l wies Prolaktin nur einen 24‐Stunden‐Rhythmus auf, mit Maximalwerten um 3.30 und Minimalwerten um 15.30 Uhr. Bei der dritten Färse ergaben die Prolaktinveränderungen vor der Enukleation des Corpus luteum am Tag 11 24‐h‐, 12‐h‐ und 8‐h‐Rhythmen, während nach der Enukleation nur noch ein 8‐h‐Rhythmus beobachtet wurde. Rythme circadien de la prolactine du plasma chez des génisses Le taux de la prolactine du plasma a été déterminé chez trois génisses avec des cycles de chaleurs réguliers. Les valeurs les plus basses ont été observées l'après‐midi et les plus élevées durant la nuit. Les données de 2 animaux non traités ont été rassemblées et adoptées à une courbe de Fourier en deux et trois parties afin d'examiner les rapports entre les concentrations de progestérone et l'échantillonnage de prolactine. Lors de l'utilisation de la courbe en trois parties, le carré moyen de la variation a été réduit à une valeur qui fut interprêtée comme occasionnelle. L'analyse de la variation des changements de prolactine journaliers lors de concentrations de progestérone de plus de 1,3 nmol/l a donné des rythmes de 24 h, 12 h et 8 h. Les valeurs maximales suivantes de ces rythmes ont été établies: 24 h pour 1.30, 12 h pour 9.00 et 21.00 et 8 h pour 3.00, 11.00 et 19.00 heures. Les rythmes correspondant furent reconnaissables aux valeurs minimales suivantes: 24 h pour 13.00, 12 h pour 3.00 et 15.00 et 8 h pour 7.00, 15.00 et 23.00 heures. Avec des concentrations de progestérone inférieures à 1,3 nmol/l, la prolactine n'a montré qu'un rythme de 24 heures avec des valeurs maximales à 3.30 et minimales à 15.30 heures. Chez la troisième génisse, les changements de prolactine ont donné des rythmes de 24 h, 12 h et 8 h avant l'énucléation du corps jaune au 11e jour, alors un rythme de 8 h a été observé après l'énucléation. El ritmo circadiano de la plasmaprolactina en becerras Se valoró el nivel de prolactina en el plasma sanguíneo en tres becerras con ciclo estral regular. Cada día se recogieron 24 muestras de sangre. Los valores máximos de plasmaprolactina fueron medidos durante el celo. Los valores mínimos se observaron por la tarde, los máximos durante la noche. Para poder estudiar las relaciones entre las concentraciones de progesterona y el modelo de prolactina, se reunieron los datos de 2 animales no tratados, adaptándose a una curva Fourier de 2 y 3 términos, resp. Utilizando la curva de 3 términos se redujo el cuadrado medio de la dispersión a una magnitud que había que juzgar como casual. El análisis de varianza de las modificaciones diarias de prolactina con concentraciones de progesterona de más de 1,3 nmol/1 tuvo por resultado ritmos de 24, 12 y 8 horas. Se comprobaron los valores máximos de estos ritmos siguientes: 24‐h a la 1.30, 12‐h a las 9.00 y 21.00, y 8‐h a las 3.00, 11.00 y 19.00. Los ritmos correspondientes estaban caracterizados por los valores mínimos siguientes: 24‐h a las 13.00, 12‐h a las 3.00 y 15.00, y 8‐h a las 7.00, 15.00 y 23.00 horas. Con concentraciones de progesterona inferiores a 1,3 nmol/l presentó la prolactina solamente un ritmo de 24 horas, con valores máximos a las 3.30 y valores mínimos a las 15.30 horas. En la becerra tercera ofrecieron las modificaciones de prolactina antes de la enucleación del cuerpo amarillo el día 11° ritmos de 24, 12 y 8 horas, mientras que después de la enucleación nada más se observó un ritmo de 8 h. © 1985 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Chronic intrauterine monitoring of electrocortical activity, eye movements,m and electromyographic activity of the nuchal muscles has permitted the use of established polygraphic criteria to study the ontogenetic development of organized sleep-wake patterns in the fetal lamb in utero. Sixty-five polygraphic recordings obtained from 21 fetal lambs ranging from 112 to 144 days of gestation (term = 145 days) were analyzed. The results show that the transition from disorganized to organized behavioral state patterns occurs at ~ 115-120 days (0.8 term). The physiologic characteristics of the arousal, quiet sleep (QS), and REM sleep (REMS) states are qualitatively similar to those in the adult. There is initially a high proportion of REMS (>50%), with only 11% time spent in arousal. The direct transition from arousal to REMS without a QS period is frequently seen in the fetus at all ages. Quantitative changes in the distribution of behavioral states continue throughout gestation. There is a significant decrease in the incidence of REMS, with a small increase in arousal and QS. The duration of QS and REMS episodes increase with age until a steady level is achieved by 130 days. There is also an increase in the frequency of occurrence of arousal periods, with no change in episode duration.

AB  - Tthylene glycol dimethyl ether (EGdiME), dlethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diEGdiME), triethylene glycol dimethyl ether (triEGdiME), dlethylene glycol diethyl ether (di- EGdlEE), ethylenethlourea (ETU), sodium selenite (SS), dimethyl phthalate (DMP), naphthalene (NAP), or p-nitrophenol (PNP) were administered by gavage for eight consecutive days to female CD-I mice. Weight loss was Insensitive as an Index of sublethal adult toxicity and was Inadequate for determining a maximum tolerated dose. LD50 values indicate that SS, NAP, and PNP were more toxic (8.4, 353.6, and 625.7 mg ¡kg, respectively) than the polyglycol ethers, ETU, and DMP (LD50 values ranged from 2525.8 to 6281.9 mg/kg). Each of the compounds was administered on d 7 through 14 to pregnant animals at a single dose estimated to be at or just below the threshold of adult lethality. In such a reproductive study, each of the compounds could be categorized on the basis of the pattern of maternal lethality and fetotoxlclty which It produced. The number of dams with complete resorptions was significantly increased after administration of ETU, and no mice in the EGdiME-, diEGdiME-, or triEGdiME- treated groups delivered any viable offspring. Maternal lethality was significant in the EGdiME, triEGdiME, PNP, and NAP groups. There was a slight reduction in the average number of live pups per litter In the dIEGdiEE- and PNP-treated groups and a significant reduction In the NAP group. The number dead per litter was increased with dIEGdiEE. SS and DMP had no effect on maternal or feta/ survival at the doses administered. Individual pup weight at d 1 postpartum was only significantly reduced by dIEGdiEE, and no gross congenital abnormalities were detected in neonates from any treatment group. These results provide guidelines for the subsequent toxicity testing of these chemicals. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The influence of sleep states on the metabolic rate and on the respiratory quotient (RQ) of low-birth-weight infants during continuous feeding was analyzed. Gestational age at birth varied between 29 and 35 weeks, postnatal age between 2 and 56 days and body weight between 0.81 and 2.11 kg. The mean oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were 10% higher, while the rise in SD was about 3-fold during REM sleep compared with NREM sleep. The RQ, however, was equal in both states. The sequence of the two sleep states did not have any influence on the analyzed parameters. Averaged over all the measurements, no statistically significant linear trend in oxygen consumption as a function of time could be found. However, small non-zero trends could be found, the direction of which appeared to depend on the sequence of the states.

AB  - Behavioral states in the near-term human fetus have been described during pregnancy. The aim of ,this study was to observe whether these same states are present during labor. Nine patients with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies participated. Fetal heart rate and uterine contractions were recorded. Fetal eye, mouth, rotation, and retroflexion of the head were observed by real-time ultrasound. Fetal movements were recorded with coded event-markers. Behavioral states were identified by the movement pattern. A total of 13 ultrasound observations, varying from 25 to 66 minutes, were obtained. Optimal viewing was present at least 60% and on the average 80% of the time. State 1F (quiet sleep), state 2F (active sleep), and state 3F (quiet awake), as well as a total of 10 state changes, were identified during labor in spite of increasing contractions and/or ruptured membranes. These observations demonstrate existence of alternating behavioral states in the healthy term fetus during labor. © 1985, Mosby. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of a standardized purified diet (AIN-76) on the teratogenic response to diphenylhydantoin (DPH) was studied in mice. Mice were fed either the purified diet or Purina Rodent Laboratory Chow for 2-4 weeks prior to mating, and were treated with either saline or 50 mg/kg of DPH on Days 12, 13, and 14 of gestation (copulatory plug = Day 0). The teratogenic response to DPH was found to be markedly potentiated in mice fed the purified diet (75% cleft palate) as compared to mice fed rodent chow (21% cleft palate). The potentiated teratogenic response to DPH correlated with markedly higher plasma DPH levels in pregnant mice fed the purified diet, indicating that the disposition of DPH was impaired. These effects were attributed to a decreased basal level of drug-metabolizing enzymes in mice fed the purified diet, as indicated by markedly prolonged hexobarbital sleeping times. Modifications of the purified diet, which included the replacement of soluble carbohydrate (50% sucrose) in the purified diet with either cornstarch or casein, did not alter the high incidence of cleft palate. A reduction in the incidence of cleft palate was observed, however, when corn oil in the purified diet was replaced with linseed oil. The replacement of corn oil with linseed oil in the purified diet also restored the hexobarbital sleeping times to those observed in mice fed rodent chow. It is concluded that mice fed purified diets have decreased basal levels of drug-metabolizing activity that alter the disposition of DPH and, as a consequence, potentiate its teratogenic effects. © 1985.

AB  - Three victims of severe cerebral anoxia developed the apallic syndrome, and clinical neurophysiological examinations documented slow evolution of a diurnal behavior pattern. Marked EEG attenuation was the primary finding, but all the patients exhibited clustering of quiescent periods at night, during which EEG waves were generated, and two stages suggested REM and non-REM sleep. The results seemed to confirm the notions that brain-stem mechanisms control occurrence of REM and non-REM sleep, and that forebrain mechanisms are required for development of differential EEG features of non-REM sleep stages (I through IV). It is also suggested that an extreme degree of attenuation resulting from EEG desynchronization in certain patients may closely resemble ECS. © 1985.

AB  - To study metabolic and endocrine adaptation of dairy cows to energy deficiency, blood metabolites and hormones were measured 37 ± 3 days after parturition during 24 h (group LE) and compared to levels in cows receiving high amounts of starch (group HE) or crystalline fat (group CF). Energy balances were −40.1, −19.0 and +1.1 MJ net energy for lactation/day, and milk yield was 30.4, 31.0 and 29.3 kg/day in groups LE, HE and CF, respectively. Animals of group LE were characterized by the lowest mean levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, albumin, insulin, thyroxine, 3,5,3′‐triiodothyronine and norepinephrine, by highest levels of non‐esterified fatty acids, acetoacetate, β‐hydroxybutyrate and growth hormone, by considerable changes of glucose levels during the 24‐h period, a marked rise of NEFA during the night, but only a small rise of insulin in response to concentrate feeding. Group CF had the highest mean glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, phospholipid and urea concentrations and the lowest growth hormone levels. Concentrations of non‐esterified fatty acids and urea were higher in group CF than in group HE. Lactate, protein, 3‐methylhistidine, glucagon, cortisol and epinephrine were not significantly affected by energy or fat intake. Metabolic and endocrine changes in group LE were typical for adaptation to energy deficiency. Feeding high amounts of starch, or crystalline fat led to elevated glucose levels, reduced fat mobilisation, and lowered ketogenesis. 24‐Stunden‐Muster der Blutkonzentration von Hormonen und Metaboliten bei Hochleistungskühen: Fütterungseffekte bedingt durch Verabreichung niedriger und hoher Mengen an Stärke und durch kristallines Fett Bei Kühen wurde die Anpassung von Stoffwechsel und endokrinen Systemen an ungenügende Energieversorgung 37 ± 3 Tage nach dem Abkalben untersucht durch Messung während 24 Stunden der Blutkonzentration verschiedener Metaboliten und Hormone (Gruppe LE) und die Veränderungen zum gleichen Zeitpunkt verglichen mit denjenigen von Kühen, welche relativ große Kraftfuttermengen (Gruppe HE) oder kristallines Fett erhielten (Gruppe CF). Die Energiebilanzen der Gruppen LE, HE und CF betrugen −40,1, −19,0 bzw. +1,1 MJ Nettoenergie für Laktation/Tag und die fettkorrigierten Milchleistungen 30,4, 31,0 bzw. 29,3 kg/Tag. Die Tiere der Gruppe LE waren charakterisiert durch die tiefsten Glucose‐, Triglycerid‐, Cholesterin‐, Albumin‐, Insulin‐, Thyroxin‐, 3,5,3′‐Triiodthyronin‐ und Noradrenalinkonzentrationen, die höchsten Konzentrationen nichtveresterter Fettsäuren (NEFA), von Acetoacetat, β‐Hydroxybutyrat und Wachstumshormon (GH), durch besonders starke Schwankungen der Glucosekonzentration im Verlaufe der 24‐Stunden‐Periode, einen massiven Anstieg der NEFA während der Nacht, aber einen nur geringen Anstieg der Insulinkonzentration nach Verabreichung von Kraftfutter. Bei der Gruppe CF wurden die höchsten Glucose‐, Triglycerid‐, Cholesterin‐, Phospholipid‐ und Harnstoffkonzentrationen und die tiefsten GH‐Konzentrationen gemessen. Bei der Gruppe CF wurden höhere NEFA‐ und Harnstoffkonzentrationen gemessen als bei der Gruppe HE. Die Lactat‐, Gesamtprotein‐, 3‐Methylhistidin‐, Glucagon‐, Cortisol‐ und Adrenalinkonzentrationen wurden durch unterschiedliche Energieaufnahme und durch Verfütterung von kristallinem Fett nicht signifikant beeinflußt. Die metabolischen und endokrinen Veränderungen bei der Gruppe LE sind typische Anpassungen an energetische Unterversorgung. Mit hohen Stärkemengen und mit kristallinem Fett gefütterte Tiere waren charakterisiert durch relativ hohe und stabile Glucosekonzentrationen, eine verminderte Depotfettmobilisation während der Nacht und eine verminderte Ketogenese. Evolution durant 24 heures des concentrations d'hormones et métabolites dans le sang chez des vaches laitières à hautes performances: effets d'une ration pauvre ou riche en amidon ou d'une ration completée par du gras cristallisé Pour étudier l'adaptation du métabolisme et du système endocrinien chez des vaches laitières recevant une ration pauvre en énergie (groupe LE), on a mesuré 37 ± 3 jours après la mise‐bas durant 24 heures les concentrations dans le sang de différents métabolites et hormones, et on a comparé les résultats aux mesures equivalents faites chez des vaches laitières à hautes performances recevant soit une ration relativement riche en concentrés (groupe HE), soit une ration complétée avec du gras cristallisé (groupe CF). Les bilans énergétiques des groupes LE, HE, CF, se sont montés à resp. −40,1, −19,0, +1,1 MJ nette énergie pour la lactation par jour, et les performances laitières des trois groupes ont été semblables (resp. 30,4, 31,0, 29,3 kg FCM/jour). Les vaches du groupe LE se sont caractérisées par de plus faibles concentrations sanguines de glucose, de triglycérides, de cholestérine, d'albumine, d'insuline, de thyroxine, de 3,5,3′‐triiodothyronine et de noradrénaline, mais, par de plus fortes concentrations d'acides gras nonestérifiés, d'acétoacetate, de β‐hydroxybutyrate, d'urée et d'hormone de croissance. De plus, les animaux du groupe LE se sont distingués par des fluctuations particulièrement fortes du glucose sanguin au cours des 24 heures, par une augmentation massive des acides gras nonestérifiés durant la nuit, mais qu'une faible augmentation de l'insuline après l'administration des concentrés. Chez les vaches du groupe CF, on a mesuré les concentrations de glucose, de triglycérides, de cholésterine, de phospholipides et d'urée les plus élevées, ainsi que par des plus faibles concentrations d'hormone de croissance. Les concentrations de lactat de protéine totale, de 3‐methylhistidine, de glucagon, de cortisol et d'adrénaline n'ont été influencées ni par une consommation différente d'énergie ni par un affourragement de gras cristallisé. Chez le group LE, les changements apparus survenus au niveau du métabolisme et du système endocrinien sont typiques d'une adaptation à une carence en énergie. Les animaux ayant reçu une ration riche en amidon, ou du gras cristallisé ont été caractérisés par une concentration de glucose sanguin relativement élevée et relativement stable au cours de 24 heures, par une moindre mobilisation des dépôts adipeux durant la nuit et par une cétogénèse réduite. Modelo de fluctuaciones durante 24 horas de las concentraciones de hormonas y metabolitos en la sangre de vacas lecheras de rendimientos elevados: los efectos de una ración pobre o rica en almidón o de una ración completada por grasa cristalina Se estudió en vacas la adaptación del metabolismo y del sistema endocrino al suministro energético insuficiente al comenzar la lactación. Para ello, se midió durante 24 horas la concentración en sangre de diversos metabolitos y hormonas (grupo LE). Las investigaciones se llevaron a cabo 37 ± 3 días después del parto. Al mismo tiempo se compararon las modificaciones con las habidas en las vacas que recibieron cantidades relativamente mayores de concentrados (grupo HE) o de grasa cristalina (grupo CF). Los balances energéticos de los grupos LE, HE y CE fueron del orden: −40,1, −19,0 y ± 1,1 MJ energía neta para lactación/día. El rendimiento de leche corregido en grasa era en los grupos LE, HE y CF de 30,4, 31,0 y 29,3 kg/día, resp. Los animales del grupo LE se hallaban caracterizados por concentraciones mínimas de glucosa, triglicéridos, colesterina, albúmina, insulina, tiroxina, 3,5,3′‐triyodotironina y noradrenalina, y por concentraciones máximas de ácidos grasos no esterificados, acetoacetato, β‐hidroxibutirato, urea y hormona del crecimiento, por fluctuaciones especialmente intensas de la concentración de glucosa en el curso del periodo de 24 horas, por el aumento masivo de los NEFA durante la noche, pero solo un aumento escaso de la concentración de insulina después de administrar pienso concentrado. En el grupo CF se midieron las concentraciones máximas de glucosa, triglicéridos, colesterina, fosfolípidos y urea y las concentraciones mínimas de GH. En el grupo CF se midieron concentraciones más elevadas de NEFA y urea que en el grupo HE. Las concentraciones de lactato, proteína total, 3‐metilhistidina, glucagon, cortisol y adrenalina no llegaron a ser influidas por la toma diversa de energía o por el consumo de grasa cristalina. Las modificaciones metabólicas y endocrinas en el grupo LE expresan rasgos típicos de la adaptación a una alimentación deficiente de energía. Los animales que recibieron cantidades mayores del almidón y de grasa cristalina estaban caracterizados por concentraciones relativamente elevadas y estables de glucosa, una mobilización reducida de las grasas de depósito durante la noche y una cetogenia restringida. © 1985 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Infants exposed in utero to antiepileptic drugs showed significantly more behaviour disturbances such as sedation (p less than 0.05) and hyperexcitability (p less than 0.01) than infants of a control group. The presence of these clinical symptoms and the time of their appearance did not seem to be dependent on the type of maternal medication, nor on the drug serum concentration in cord blood nor on the rate of drug disappearance from the infant's plasma.

AB  - An evident coincidence exists between increased and extended apneas during sleep and frequent gastroesophageal reflux as well as disturbances of propulsive esophageal peristalsis. The tendency to develop apnea and disturbed esophageal function are related to the degree of the maturity of the patient. This indicates that in some infants, a combined regulatory immaturity of the autonomic centers persists. Moreover, the gastroesophageal reflux fosters the clinical manifestation of sleep apneas. The risk of a reflex apnea accompanied by gastroesophageal reflux increases in proportion to the disturbance in the central respiratory regulation present at the same time. This pathomechanism can be considered one of the causes of the sudden infant death syndrome. The possibility of effective prophylaxis consists in treating the apneic tendency with aminophylline and the treatment of reflux by elevating the upper body and thickening the nourishment given.

AB  - Eleven mother-infant pairs were studied to determine the effect of maternal caffeine ingestion (500 mg/day) on heart rate and sleep time of the infants. In a balanced cross-over design, mothers ingested 5 cups of decaffeinated coffee daily during one 5-day period and 5 cups of decaffeinated coffee with added caffeine (100 mg/cup) during another 5-day period. Concentrations of caffeine in milk on the last day of the caffeine period ranged from 1.6 to 6.2 μg/ml and the intake of caffeine by the infants was estimated to be 0.3-1.0 mg/kg/day. Infant serum did not contain detectable amounts of caffeine on the last day of either experimental period. Performance during the caffeine and no-caffeine periods was not significantly different with respect to either 24-hour heart rate or sleep time.

AB  - This study investigated the prolonged effects on state behavior of theophylline administered to infants for apnea of prematurity. There were three groups: Four premature infants who had received theophylline in the preterm period, five premature infants who had not received theophylline, and twenty-eight normal fullterm infants. The theophylline infants had been off the drug for at least one month prior to the beginning of the study. Sleep-wake states were observed in the home of seven-hour periods when all infants were the same corrected ages: two, three, four and five weeks postterm. Data from the portion of the day that the infants were alone were analysed for this study. The state organization of the theophylline group differed significantly from those of the other groups. They exhibited more non-alert waking activity, more alert, more drowse or transition, and less active sleep than did the Non-Theophylline and Fullterm infants. The state distributions of the latter two groups did not differ. On the basis of similarities between the results of this study and of a previous animal study, it was concluded that theophylline altered the normal development of state organization in premature infants. These effects persisted long after the drug had cleared the body.

AB  - We studied the ontogeny and temporal organization of non-nutritive sucking during active sleep in 6 healthy preterm infants (mean birthweight 1.1 kg (range 0.8-1.3 kg) gestational age 28.6 weeks (range 26-30 w)) from 30 to 35 weeks of post-menstrual (PM) age. Recognizable rhythmical sucking bursts were recorded at 28 weeks in one infant and by 31-33 weeks in the others. Results were analyzed for the periods 30-31, 32-33 and 34-35 PM weeks. The number of bursts/min increased with age, while the duration of each burst was stable (mean 4.1 s). The pause between bursts decreased. Sucking pace within bursts increased with age which resulted in an increase in the overall rate of sucking. The coefficient of variation (CV) for intersuck time within bursts and for interburst time was computed to examine the stability of the sucking rhythm. For intersuck time the CV was relatively low and constant across ages. However, for interburst time CV was relatively large across ages. Thus, there appears to be a stability of the interburst sucking rhythm from 30 weeks of gestation, whereas the interburst rhythm is less regular. This documentation of temporal organization in sucking from 30 weeks is one of the earliest indications of an intrinsic rhythm in human behavior. © 1985.

AB  - Noise‐induced hearing loss due to intense and long‐term noise exposure is no longer disputed since the etiology is well defined. However, the influence of noise on the vegetative functions is not so clear. In addition to existing investigations on vegetative functional disturbances, the role of noise as a risk factor has to be determined and its effects have to be quantified. The significance of noise‐induced sleep disturbances in relation to health and well‐being, is also controversial. The hypothesized causal connection between acoustical stimulation and the occurrence of disorders, includes primary‐effects (e.g. awakenings) and after‐effects (e.g. changes in mood or performance). To date, it has not been feasible to determine late after‐effects, such as health disorders. The most often reported sociopsychological effect of noise is general annoyance, whereby annoyance is defined as disturbance of communication, rest, recreation or concentration. Some results indicate a higher sensitivity of critical groups (e.g. old people, the sick, children, pregnant women). Copyright © 1985 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Idiopathic apnea in preterm infants, more than 30 weeks of gestation, after the first week of life is uncommon and poorly understood. To study ventilatory control in these infants we measured minute ventilation, respiratory frequency, tidal volume, end-tidal oxygen pressure and carbon dioxide pressure, and transcutaneous oxygen pressure before and during the fifth minute of breathing 4% carbon dioxide in air. Nine healthy preterm infants and eight infants with three or more episodes of apnea (≥20 s) in 24 hours were studied during active sleep. We found that infants with apnea had a significantly increased alveolar carbon dioxide pressure while respiratory frequency, minute ventilation, and slope were significantly decreased. Alveolar-transcutaneous oxygen gradients were essentially unchanged. These preterm infants with apnea have a decreased carbon dioxide sensitivity. They have a decreased minute ventilation primarily as a result of decreased respiratory frequency and their alveolar-transcutaneous oxygen gradient is normal. Our findings suggest that the major deficit in these infants is a central disturbance in the regulation of breathing. © 1985, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fetal breathing movements (FBM) indicated by repetitive negative intrathoracic pressures and biparietal electrocorticograms (ECoG) were recorded from 8 fetal sheep for 3 h before (control) and 3 h after the administration of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide. FBM and the low voltage (LV) ECoG state occurred 36±5% (SEM) and 60±3% of the control period, respectively. Virtually no FBM occurred during high voltage (HV) ECoG while in 57±6% of the LV state the fetuses were making FBM. The peak magnitude of the negative intrathoracic (tracheal) pressure deflections was 4±1 Torr. Following acetazolamide the incidence of FBM rose to 53±4% (P&lt;0.01) but there was no significant change in the incidence of the LV state (58±3%). Most of the increase in the incidence of FBM remained confined to periods of LV ECoG activity so that an increased proportion of this state (88±2%, P&lt;0.001) was occupied with respiratory efforts. The amplitude of the FBM also increased to 8±1 Torr (P&lt;0.05). The increased incidence and depth of FBM is most likely due to an elevated hydrogen ion concentration and differs from a fetal respiratory acidosis induced by increasing the inspired CO2 fraction to the ewe in that the respiratory stimulation induced by acetazolamide is not associated with an increased incidence of the permissive LV ECoG state. © 1985.

AB  - The effectiveness, safety and acceptability of self-administered Entonox (50% nitrous oxide in oxygen) in 150 Nigerian women during labour was studied. 86.7% of those who received Entonox alone reported satisfactory pain relief while analgesia was also satisfactory in all those who received Entonox plus intramuscular analgesic. Severe drowsiness occurred in two patients and the method was acceptable to 90% of the mothers in the study. To prevent exhaustion of the mothers and marked drowsiness, intramuscular analgesic should be used early in labour followed by Entonox in the second half of the labour.

AB  - Based on the present observations, we agree with Zuspan and coworkers (1975) in suggesting that intrauterine opiate withdrawal presents a severe physiologic stress to the developing fetus. Our data, showing that a significant abstinence syndrome may be precipitated following short (2 hours), low-dose fetal exposure to morphine, further suggest that the fetus may undergo a cycle of acute physical dependence and withdrawal following the administration of opiates in normal clinical patients.

AB  - There is a paucity of information concerning the interrelationship of psychiatric and neuroendocrine abnormalities in pseudocyesis. We have studied two patients using a multimodal investigatory approach, with particular attention to the association of depression and alterations in endocrine secretory patterns. Both patients had abnormal growth hormones secretory patterns, as demonstrated by lack of sleep-associated peaks and the absence of a response to L-dopa administration. Both patients had elevated testosterone and estradiol levels and normal prolactin levels. Only the patient who met DSM II criteria for a major depressive episode had abnormally elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) levels and large LH pulse amplitudes. These findings, together with a review of cases reported in the literature, suggest that no single neuroendocrine profile is common to all patients with pseudocyesis.

AB  - Plasma levels of GH, LH and FSH were measured in 74 three-day-old newborn infants with hyperbilirubinemia before and after exposure to continuous phototherapy (PhT) for 48 h. The results obtained were compared with data observed over the same period of time in 46 newborn infants belonging to the control group having homogeneous characteristics as far as form of delivery (spontaneous), gestation age, chronological age, sex, birth weight and basal blood glucose were concerned, except hyperbilirubinemia and necessity of PhT. Hyperbilirubi-nemic female newborn showed higher plasma GH concentrations in comparison with hyperbiliru-binemic males and with controls. Forty-eight h of continuous PhT significantly reduced GH levels which, however, appeared not to be substantially different from those of normal controls of the same age. Moreover, PhT determined a slight trend to increase in FSH of females, and did not modify the physiological decline of LH in both sexes during the first five days of life. The reduction of GH following PhT from abnormal to physiological concentrations may be due to the direct effect of light and /or to continuous light-related disorders of sleep. In conclusion, 48 h of continuous exposure to light (PhT) do not impair the newborn’s pituitary functions here studied. © 1985, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE). All rights reserved.

AB  - In Japan, alcohol consumption and alcohol‐related problems have rapidly increased since the industrial development after World War II, and in 1980, 1.9 per cent of the total Japanese population were estimated to be heavy drinkers, while 6‐per cent of psychiatric beds were occupied by alcoholics. The number of women alcoholics and incidence of the fetal alcohol syndrome are, however, extremely low in Japan mainly due to cultural restraints on drinking in women. The ratio of alcoholic liver disease to total liver disease was 10.7 per cent in a nationwide survey in 1977, and high percentages of hepatic fibrosis and mild alcoholic hepatitis were the chief histological features of Japanese alcoholic liver disease. Racial and individual differences in the alcohol flushing response are of interest, and half of the Japanese exhibit facial flushing after drinking a small amount of alcohol. Japanese subjects with a low Km deficient isozyme of ALDH showed a high level of blood acetaldehyde and facial flushing. Danushukai, Cyanamide and Naikan Therapy have had the greatest impact on the development of alcoholism treatment in Japan. Regarding mortality among alcoholics, liver disease, suicide, accidents and cerebro‐vascular disease showed higher death rates than in the general population. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - A large range of tests is now available to help us understand, diagnose and manage GH-related growth disorders. The traditional provocative tests of GH secretion will identify short children with severe GH deficiency. However, evidence is emerging that these pharmacological tests may not be sufficiently sensitive to identify some subjects with GH deficiency arising from neurosecretory disturbance of GH release. There is a need for a simple sensitive test that will detect subtle GH secretion of this type. hGRF administration is a reliable test of GH reserve and, when used in combination with conventional tests, may help to identify GH-deficient children with hypothalamic GRF deficiency. Whether the GH responses following GRF administration reflects physiological GH secretory activity needs to be established. The diagnosis of acromegaly is made on clinical grounds. The abnormal GH responses to glucose and TRH support the diagnosis, but by themselves should not be considered to be diagnostic of acromegaly. An elevated Sm C level also helps to establish the diagnosis, although Sm C concentrations may be elevated to the same degree in pregnancy and during puberty. The use of Sm C to monitor disease activity remains to be established. Circulating GRF levels should be measured in patients with acromegaly so that ectopic production of GRF can be identified. © 1985, W. B. Saunders Company. All rights reserved. All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied different parameters of personality in a sample of 100 male children from 8 to 14 years, who attend a school under a local government protection and whose parents are alcoholics. The sample has been divided in three groups, according to the sex of the alcoholic progenitor: sons of alcoholic father (76 children), sons of alcoholic mother (8 children) and sons with both father and mother alcoholics (16 children). We observed in all of them psychopathologic disorders (onicophagy, anxiety, phobias, etc.), psychoaffective problems (emitional shyness, feeling of insecurity, etc.), learning problems (dyslexias), psychosomatic upsets (headaches, asthma), alterations in the sleep (insomnia, somnambulism, night terrors) as well as problems in the psychosocial adaptation (family and school maladjustment, toxicomanias). In the three groups studied, those children with both father and mother alcoholics showed a higher percentage of anomalies, being for some parameters (anxiety, insomnia, onicophagy, dyslexis, etc.) statistically significant in relation to the other two groups.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate responses of human fetuses near term (37-42 wks) (increase/decrease of fetal heart rate and/or fetal motility) to acoustic stimuli. The study group consisted of 43 patients and the control group of 27 patients. Polygraphic recordings of 5 different fetal variables were carried out synchronously for the categorization of the actual fetal behavioural state according to Nijhuis et al. (Nijhuis, J.G., Prechtl, H.F.R., Martin, C.B., Jr. and Bots, R.S.A.M. (1982): Early Hum. Dev., 6, 177-195). Controlled acoustic stimulation was performed either with sine wave tone (2 kHz, 120 dB and 5 s duration) or modulated sine wave tone (0.5-2 kHz, 'sawtooth' modulation, 120 dB and 5 s duration). An additional group of patients received 'sham' stimulation. Overall 84 acoustic stimulations have been carried out. In 26 out of 84 stimulations (30%) a fetal response could be observed within 5 s after acoustic stimulation. In general, there were far fewer fetal responses in sleep states than in states of wakefulness. Whereas in state 1 F only 1 out of 28 acoustic stimulations was followed by an immediate fetal response, more responses were observed in state 2 F. An obvious increase in fetal reactivity to acoustic stimulation was noted in states of wakefulness (states 3 F and 4 F). Comparison between the true and sham stimulations revealed a relatively high level of spontaneous fetal activity (high variation of fetal heart rate and fetal motility) present in states 2 F and 4 F. This must be taken into account in all assessments of fetal responses. Changes in state (within 3 min) induced by sound stimulation were not detectable with certainty and seemed to occur incidentally. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of the relationship between fetal responses and behavioural state. All investigations with fetal stimulation must be performed in exactly defined behavioural state in order to obtain statistically comparable results. © 1985.
