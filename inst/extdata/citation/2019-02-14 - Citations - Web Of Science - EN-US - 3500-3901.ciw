AB Sleep disorder during the course of pregnancy has been recently recognized in humans. However, the underlying mechanism of pregnancy-associated sleep disorder remains undetermined, and sleep changes even during normal pregnancy have not been fully understood. To describe the effects of pregnancy on sleep, sleep-wake patterns before and after fertile mating were compared in an animal model. Baseline recordings of sleep and brain temperature were made throughout a normal 4-day estrous cycle in female rats. After the rats became pregnant, the recordings continued across the entire pregnant period. Compared with baseline sleep before mating, both non-rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep increased significantly from the first night of pregnancy. Although rapid eye movement sleep returned to the baseline level from midpregnancy, nocturnal non-rapid eye movement sleep stayed enhanced during the entire pregnant period. Daytime sleep fluctuated toward the end of pregnancy. Brain temperature was elevated during the early period of pregnancy but did not correlate with enhanced sleep. The results suggest that physiological changes in different stages of pregnancy may contribute to the regulation of maternal sleep and temperature.

AB This study was designed to explore risk factors for breast cancer with emphasis on the detection of clinical markers of the hormonal imbalance during the perimenarche. Three hundred and thirty women diagnosed with breast cancer and 346 population controls were identified and interviewed in Girona, Spain between 1986 and 89. Cases were more likely than controls to have had long menstrual periods in the first 5 years after menarche [odds ratio (OR) = 3.0], to experience menopause at a late age (OR = 1.5) and to report acne during adolescence (OR = 1.6). Family history of breast cancer was associated with an increased risk (OR = 2.3). Cases reported a lower use of drug treatments for anxiety and sleep disorders than controls. Moderate alcohol drinkers and smokers were at lower risk for breast cancer. No statistically significant association with breast cancer was observed for number of children, age at last pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, hormonal treatment after menopause and weight perception during the teenage years. Hormonal changes in the years following menarche may be relevant to breast cancer risk. The roles of menstrual period length and acne during adolescence should be further explored.

DE automated 24-h blood pressure monitoring (ABPM); normal pregnancy;
   circadian rhythm
AB Objectives: The aims of this work were to establish automated blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) standards during the three trimesters of pregnancy and to analyze the chronobiological trend of blood pressure during gestation. Methods: A longitudinal study using 24-h ABPM was performed on 192 healthy pregnant women, (aged 20-42 years, mean+/-S.D. 28+/-5) both nulliparas (n=85) and multiparas (n=107), and also on 26 pregnant women with chronic hypertension and 132 preeclamptic patients. The arterial pressure (AP) of the healthy women, at the start of the pregnancy, was <140/90 mmHg, as measured by the standard mercury sphygmomanometer, and it remained so at subsequent check-ups throughout the pregnancy and puerperium. AP was monitored using the Spacelabs 90207 (Nippon Collin, Takeda UA 751), beginning at 08:00 h. Results: The normal pregnancies demonstrated an AP circadian rhythm with daytime systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) values about 8-9 mmHg (P <0.01) higher than at night. In the normal pregnancies, the mean 24-h AP values, like mean daytime and night-time, SAP and DAP values, remained the same in the first two trimesters, while a slight but significant increase occurred in the third (P <0.05). Conclusions. This study enabled a range of normal pressure values to be deduced for each hour of the day throughout the three trimesters of pregnancy. This may facilitate a more accurate evaluation of individual pressure readings in pregnant women so as to ensure a more reliable and timely diagnosis of hypertension.

ID INFANT-DEATH-SYNDROME; FULL-TERM; REFLEX; RELEASE; HYPOXIA; SLEEP; FETUS
AB Objective: To evaluate the autonomic response in preterm neonates born after an at-risk pregnancy.
   Methodology: Twenty-one preterm neonates (gestational age; GA) 29-37 weeks; bodyweight (BW): 720-2113 g; postnatal age: 2-126 days), born after at-risk pregnancies (stressed (STR) group), were compared to 30 preterm neonates (GA: 26-36 weeks; BW: 813-2380 g; postnatal age: 2-86 days) without any intrauterine risk factor (C group). A 10s pain stimulus was given on the forefoot and heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure were measured at 15 and 30 s, at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 min. After 10s ocular compression six cardiac variables were recorded.
   Results: After the pain stimulus the STR-group had a significant increase of heart rate at 15 s and an increase of diastolic blood pressure at 30 s. In the C group a significant increase of heart rate at 15 s was recorded. For the respiratory rate both groups showed an initial depression (significant at 15 s in the C group) followed by an increase. The time to react to the ocular compression was significantly shorter in the STR-group than in the C-group and thus more parasympathetic.
   Conclusions: We hypothesize that the different sympathetic and parasympathetic reaction patterns of the vital parameters to triggers in the STR-group are due to chronic stress, pointing to an altered maturation of the two components of the autonomic nervous system after chronic intrauterine stress (CIUSTR).

AB Using Fos immunohistochemistry as a marker of cellular activity, we have shown that neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of fetal sheep are active by 35 days gestation. From at least 90 days gestation (term is 146 days), these neurons are more active during the day (12.00) than at night (03.00) when pregnant ewes are exposed to a 12-h light-dark cycle with lights on at 07.00. The day-night difference in Fos immunoreactivity persisted when the lighting schedule was extended by Sh to 03.00, although neurons were now more active at 03.00 than they were in fetuses maintained on the normal light-dark cycle. When ewes were maintained in constant light from 133 to 138 days, the day-night difference in Fos immunoreactivity in the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus was abolished, suggesting that diurnal activity of the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus is maintained by a signal related to the external lighting regime. In a twin pregnancy where one fetus was optically enucleated at 100 days gestation, the density of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus during the day at 138 days was similar to the unoperated twin. This suggests that the effects of dim light in the uterus on the fetal retina do not account for the high level of Fos immunoreactivity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the daytime.
   We propose that a chemical messenger of maternal origin, possibly melatonin, suppresses the activity of fetal suprachiasmatic neurons during the night, and that fetal suprachiasmatic neurons have endogenous activity which is expressed fully during the daytime. Copyright (C) 1996 IBRO.

ID SLEEPING POSITION; UNEXPECTED DEATH; SMOKING
AB Aims. To compare the prevalence of risk factors for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in New Zealand (SIDS mortality 3.53/1000) with that in the South West Thames (SWT) region of the United Kingdom (SIDS mortality 1.36/1000).
   Methods. The methodology of the study was essentially identical in New Zealand and SWT. The subjects in both countries were randomly selected from all births in the study regions. The subjects were randomly allocated an age at which to be interviewed using the same questionnaire in the two study areas. Obstetric records were also examined. Eighteen hundred subjects were selected in New Zealand and 700 subjects in SWT.
   Results. Younger and unmarried mothers were slightly more common in New Zealand than in SWT. The prevalence of maternal smoking, prone sleeping position and infants' sharing of beds with another person were all higher in New Zealand than SWT, thus increasing the risk of SIDS (maternal smoking in pregnancy: 31.0% vs 23.8% respectively, chi(2) = 11.6, p = 0.001; prone sleeping position: 32.9% vs 25.9%, chi(2) = 18.9, p < 0.001; bed sharing: 10.5% vs 6.8%, chi(2) = 6.0, p = 0.14). However, New Zealand infants were breast fed more frequently and for longer than infants in SWT, which would tend to reduce the risk of SIDS in the New Zealand population. In combination the differences in the prevalences of these four risk factors explain only 20% of the excess risk of SIDS in New Zealand.
   Conclusions. The high SIDS mortality rate in New Zealand is not simply explained by a high prevalence of known and modifiable risk. factors for SIDS.

AB Diurnal periodicities of cardiorespiratory function were monitored between 144 and 156 days of gestation (term = 175 days) in six chronically instrumented fetal baboons. For each fetus, 5-11 days of electrocardiographic and tracheal fluid pressure data were summarized as hourly means of fetal heart rate (FHR), standard deviation of FHR, breath-to-breath interval (B-B-i) and percent time spent in fetal breathing activity (PFB). Summaries were evaluated by cosinor analysis to determine the least squares fit to a 24-h cycle. For all fetuses, FHR had a significant (P < 0.001) diurnal rhythm with peak to nadir fluctuations of 17.4 beats/min around a 24-h mean of 163.2 beats/min. The time of the peak FHR was similar across animals occurring in the mid-day between 10:49 h and 14:45 h. For each fetus, standard deviation of FHR also had a significant (P < 0.01) diurnal periodicity with highest values at night between 20:15 h and 02:04 h. The times of the acrophase for these heart rate parameters were correlated (R = 0.88, P < 0.02) across fetuses. Significant (P < 0.001) 24-h rhythms were found in four of six fetuses for B-B-i and five of six for PFB. These PFB rhythms accounted for a fluctuation of 14.4% around a mean of 36.9 +/- 4.5%. In contrast to heart rate, the acrophases of fetal breathing parameters were distributed throughout the entire 24-h cycle and not significantly correlated across fetuses. It is concluded that diurnal rhythms of fetal heart rate, which are synchronized with light/dark conditions in the environment, are evidence for a passive response or entrainment of fetal systems to maternal circadian influences. Alternately, the absence of synchronization across fetuses in daily rhythms of fetal breathing activity provides evidence for a functioning fetal pacemaker, and not simply the imposition of maternal rhythms on her fetus. This differential in the cardiac and breathing activity of the developing primate indicates that pathways for entrainment of fetal pacemaker function are subject to important maturational influences during late gestation.

ID HENS
AB The expression of one behaviour by an animal limits the amount of time available to express other behaviours. In this experiment the amount of time animals had to forage was manipulated by decreasing the rate of food reinforcement available from a foraging device (the 'Edinburgh Foodball'). The aims of this experiment were to examine how decreased reinforcement rate affected the expression of foraging behaviour and the time budget of pigs. Six pregnant primiparous sows (Sus scrofa) were individually and sequentially exposed to two treatments-high or low reinforcement rate from the foraging device-in a balanced manner. Pigs responded to a decrease in reinforcement rate by increasing the proportion of time foraging and the rate of foraging responses, and by decreasing the time between foraging responses. On both treatments time spent feeding remained constant and daily food intake was significantly lower on the low reinforcement rate. Pigs during the hours of observations used (daylight) time spent sleeping first and then time from resting to accommodate the increase in time spent performing foraging behaviour. Furthermore, the results suggest that the amount of time spent searching for food is dependent upon the amount of time spent feeding and not, as expected, dependent on the amount of food consumed. The results suggest that foraging pigs are using a 'rule of thumb' controlling qualitative and quantitative aspects of foraging behaviour, which is based on maintaining a constant amount of time spent feeding.

AB Ambulatory monitoring devices (AMDs) such as Holter (EGG) and apnea (respiratory) monitors with built-in date- and time-correlated memories are occasionally encountered in the forensic autopsy. Diagnostic data are usually readily obtained by returning the device to the hospital department or rental company. This data can be easily correlated with autopsy findings to arrive at surprisingly precise conclusions in some cases. We present two illustrative cases: an elderly man wearing a Holter monitor who shot himself in the mouth with a shotgun, and a 15-month-old oxygen-dependent prematurely born boy with bronchopulmonary dysplasia whose apnea monitor had been turned off 5 days before he died of bronchopneumonia. We discuss other kinds of AMDs that may be encountered in the forensic autopsy and suggest that information from these monitors perhaps should become part of the forensic autopsy report.

AB An ideal vibroacoustic stimulus for testing fetal reactivity has yet to be developed. In the present study in fetal sheep we tested the effect on behavioral state of an amplitude and frequency-modulated signal produced at the abdominal surface of the ewe. The stimulus was presented during periods of fetal non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Evaluation of behavioral state was accomplished by visual observation of strip-chart recordings. Assessed in this manner, vibroacoustic stimulation during NREM sleep consistently resulted in a change to an indeterminate state. However, stimulation during REM sleep failed to have an effect. Additional evaluation applying spectral analysis to the fetal electrocorticogram during stimulation in NREM sleep revealed a marked decrease in delta band power from 100 to 27 +/- 5% and in theta band power from 100 to 40 +/- 4% resulting in a decrease in total power from 100 to 35 +/- 4% (p < 0.05). Stimulation during REM Behavioral state sleep revealed a significant increase in beta band power from 100 to 123 +/- 14%. Vibroacoustic stimulation in both NREM and REM sleep led to an increase in spectral edge frequency, implying central arousal.

AB Earlier studies in The Gambia suggested that the use of impregnated bednets might prove to be a useful malaria control strategy. Based on the results of these studies, in 1992 the Government of The Gambia was encouraged to initiate a National Impregnated Bednet Programme (NIBP) as part of the National Malaria Control Programme Strategy. This paper describes the implementation process/procedure of the NIBP. Evaluation results showed that, overall, 83% of the bednets surveyed had been impregnated, and 77% of children under the age of five years and 78% of women of childbearing age were reported to be sleeping under impregnated bednets.

AB Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) provides a profile of blood pressure (BP) during daily activities and sleep and could uncover the inter-individual variability of BP, The aims of this study were to establish the normal values of the ABPM during the three trimesters of normal pregnancy, and to compare these values with those obtained in the office. ABPM was carried out on 22 normotensive pregnant women, BP values were compared with those obtained in the office, BP during the third trimester was significantly higher than the BP recorded during the first two gestational periods. In the three trimesters of pregnancy mean ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP were lower than the BP measured in the office in lying and standing positions, On the other hand, mean ambulatory BP (systolic and diastolic) measured during daily activities was not significantly different from the BP measured in the office, Sleeping BP was significantly lower than waking values in all trimesters, while there were not significant differences in the degree of BP fall among the three trimesters, Six women were sequentially studied during the three trimesters of pregnancy and particularly at the 12, 24 and 32 weeks of pregnancy, In these women, a small but significant rise in mean 24 h systolic and diastolic BP was observed at 32 weeks of pregnancy, Sleeping BP was significantly lower than waking values in the three trimesters, No significant difference in the degree of BP fall on the three gestational dates was found, It is concluded that ABPM is a useful tool for the evaluation of BP variability during pregnancy, During normal pregnancy ambulatory BP levels are highest in the day and lowest at night at all gestational ages and increased at the third trimester of pregnancy compared to the values observed during the first two gestational periods.

AB Substance P and neurokinin A were assayed in the trigeminal nucleus and cervical spinal cord of 4-day cycling female, ovariectomized, and male rats, During the estrous cycle, levels were largely stable in the trigeminal nucleus, In ovariectomized rats, the levels differed from those on any day of the estrous cycle suggesting a weak effect of ovarian steroids, In males, the variations in the substance P and neurokinin A contents in the trigeminal nucleus were not similar to those in either cyclic or ovariectomized rats.
   The levels fluctuated substantially in the cervical spinal cord, During the first 3 days of the estrous cycle, the substance P and neurokinin A contents fell concomitant with the 17 beta-estradiol surge, suggesting a downregulation of substance P and neurokinin A contents by 17 beta-estradiol. Furthermore, on estrus, progesterone seemed to inhibit the accumulation of both neurokinins.
   Testosterone may stimulate accumulation of substance P and neurokinin A in the cervical spinal cord, with a marked circadian rhythm.
   These results are in favor of the neurokinin content of the spinal cord being regulated by the gonadal steroids, In the trigeminal nucleus, only testosterone has an effect. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The purpose of this study was to describe the differences between primigravidae and multigravidae women in their experience of sleep efficiency, fatigue and vitality, and level of functioning in the third trimester of pregnancy and the first month postpartum. A secondary analysis of a descriptive, longitudinal study was done. A convenience sample of 31 pregnant women was used to test the hypothesis that multigravidae would have significantly higher levels of functioning in the household, increased fatigue, and decreased sleep efficiency and vitality than primigravidae at both phases of the study. Results indicate, however, that primigravidae experienced significantly more disturbed sleep, with sleep efficiency falling from 89.79% in the third trimester to 77.25% postpartum. Multigravidae had only a minor reduction in sleep efficiency from 86.76% in the third trimester to 83.99% postpartum. Although there was no statistically significant difference in level of vitality, primigravidae experienced more fatigue (73.58 +/- 15.22) than multigravidae (64.35 +/- 18.96) at 1 month postpartum. These results suggest that maternal role ''acquisition,'' experienced by primigravidae, results in more fatigue and sleep disruption than does maternal role ''expansion.'' The significant decrease in sleep efficiency and increase in fatigue in primigravidae after delivery indicate that health care professionals need to provide anticipatory guidance to primigravidae to help smooth the transition from pregnancy to motherhood.

AB In mammals the photoperiodic synchronization of circadian system starts before birth. During fetal and neonatal period mothers relay the photoperiodic information to their litter. The maternal pineal melatonin 24 h cycle acts as a synchronizing signal. We have studied the effect of pineal maternal sympathetic denervation and administration of melatonin to mothers denervated during gestation on the prenatal synchronization of testicular malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity circadian rhythm of the offspring 25 days after birth, When mothers were denervated at the 7th, 10th or 11th day of gestation, pups showed disruption of testicular MDH activity circadian rhythms. In contrast, no disruptive effect was observed when the mothers were denervated on the 12th or 14th day of gestation, When denervated mothers (7th day of gestation) were treated with a daily dose of melatonin hom the 11th to the 14th day of gestation, pups showed a MDH activity circadian rhythm. The hormone failed to impose a daily phase when administered from the 9th to the 12th day of gestation. Results suggest that prenatal synchronization in the rat occurs very early in the development, before suprachiasmatic nuclei morphologic arrangement and functional activity begin.

AB A patient with a strongly lesioned spinal cord, sub C5, relearned running, besides improving other movements, by an oscillator formation training (rhythmic, dynamic, stereotyped exercise). After 45 days of jumping on a springboard and other rhythm trainings, the patient was able to run 90 m in 4ls (7.9 km/h) (even 9.3 km/h 3 years after the lesion) besides marching (5.7 km/h), cycling, playing tennis and skiing.
   FF-type (alpha(1)) (f = 8.3-11.4 Hz) and FR-type (alpha(2)) (f = 6.7 Hz) motor unit firings were identified by electromyography (EMG) with surface electrodes by their oscillatory firing patterns in this patient. In EMG literature, the alpha(2)-oscillatory firing is called ''myokymic discharging''
   Alternating long and short oscillation periods were measured in FF-type motor units, with changing focus (change from long/short to short/long oscillation periods). The alternating mean period durations differred by approximately 10 ms.
   Transient synchronization of oscillatory firing FF-type motor units was observed with up to two phase relations per oscillation cycle.
   In recumbent position, the phase change in synchronization of two oscillatory firing motor units in the soleus muscle of one leg correlated with the change from alternating to symmetrical oscillatory firing of a third motor unit in the soleus muscle of the other leg. This measurement indicates that the alternating oscillatory firing of premotor neuronal networks is correlated with synchronization of oscillatory firing neuronal subnetworks, i.e. with coupling changes of oscillators, and is not due to reciprocal inhibition of half-centre oscillators as suggested by the change from alternating to symmetrical oscillatory firing. Coupling changes of oscillatory firing subnetworks to generate macroscopic (integrative) network functions are therefore a general organization form of the central nervous system (CNS), and are not related to rhythmic movements like walking or running only.
   It is proposed that synchronization of spinal oscillators, phase changes in synchronization, changes from alternating to symmetrical firing and backwards, and changes in the focus of alternating oscillatory firing are, among others, physiologic coupling rules of the human CNS to generate, by ongoing coupling changes of oscillatory firing subnetworks, integrative functions such as rhythmic and non-rhythmic movements.
   One phase relation between two oscillatory firing alpha(1)-motor units was preserved from one volitional leg muscle activation (isometric contraction) to the subsequent one. Since running times improved upon successive runs for 90 m, the spinal cord seems to be able to store pattern organization for seconds up to minutes.
   Controlled and uncontrolled oscillatory firing of alpha(1)-motor units in volitionally activated leg muscles were observed in this patient, which indicated that there still were pathologic recruitments of subnetworks after re-learning running and other movements.
   During walking, running, and jumping on a springboard, the activation patterns of the vastus lateralis, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, peronaeus longus, peronaeus brevis and soleus muscles were recorded (surface electromyography) to be still pathologic in accordance with partly still pathologic joint rotation angles measured kinematically. Especially upon running, the left knee joint flexion was reduced in swine by a rather permanent activity of the rectus femoris combined with an extra burst of the vastus lateralis in mid-swing. The recorded abnormalities are due to modification of the motor program rather than to muscle weakness per se. A further improvement of the movements of the patient seems possible by improving the motor program, i.e. by improving the functioning of the spinal pattern generators.
   By comparing the phasic EMG activity upon walking, running and jumping on a springboard, the motor program turned out to be best for jumping and running, at least with respect to the activity of the left peronaeus longus muscle. This indicates that during the more rhythmic, dynamic, stereotyped movements (like jumping or running) more physiologic spinal motor programs were activated by the remaining supraspinal drive. Jumping on a springboard generated the most physiologic movement pattern, probably by ''Mitbewegung'' (co-movement) activated by the synchronization of both legs once per jumping cycle, which induced stronger synchronization of right and left movement pattern generators by a shared afferent input and cycle resettings of oscillatory firing subnetworks of the left and right pattern generators.
   It is proposed that at least partly, the spinal cord generates stereotyped movements by coupling changes of oscillatory firing subnetworks. The main cause for the movement disorders (and spasticity) occurring following spinal cord lesion is the pathologic organization of the functionally deteriorated neuronal subunits below the lesion (because of nonuse as one reason) in combination with a lesion- and degeneration-induced unbalanced supraspinal and afferent drive, respectively for self-organization of spinal networks.
   On the basis of our successful therapy trial and measurements on normal, brain-dead, completely (paraplegic) and incompletely spinal cord lesioned (tetraparetic) individuals, it is proposed that the training-induced plasticity of the human CNS to re-preformate neuronal networks for up to minutes and permanently has been underestimated. The oscillator formation training was successful, since the rhythm training fitted the rhythmic organization of the CNS (at least with respect to the premotor alpha(1), alpha(2) alpha(3)-oscillators), as the rhythmic, stereotyped, dynamic leg movements are mainly located in the lumbosacral enlargement of the cord, which was not lesioned in this patient (lesion sub C5), and could be activated by the little remaining supraspinal drive, and since co-movement (''Mitbewegung'') was induced once per jumping cycle by the simultaneous afferent input. This improvement in movements was made possible by re-preformation of spinal neuronal networks for improved self-organization by rhythmic movement-induced afferent input, and by rebalanced lesion-adapted drive of supraspinal networks (by lesion-adapted reorganization).
   The type-related single motor axon firing patterns were partly verified by telemetrically obtained rhythmic EMG patterns. The self-organization of spinal oscillators, including coupling rules between oscillators, was compared with mathematically derived coupling features of populations of interacting nonlinear biological oscillators, and is discussed with respect to generation of spinal pattern generators in man and animals. Spasticity, ''Mitbewegungen'' (co-movement), ''reafference principle'', supraspinal control and putative descending systems are analysed with respect to the pathologic organization of the human nervous system following incomplete spinal cord lesion. The oscillator formation Graining is compared with the Bobath therapy, reinforcement learning and treadmill walking.
   Eight 0 to 5 days old naked infants, born in week 36 to 41 of gestation, showed primary automatic stepping with a mean frequency of 0.2 Hz upon natural simulation of the soles of their feet. The incompletely spinal cord lesioned patient was walking, jumping and running with frequencies of 0.8 Hz, 0.9 Hz and 1.5 Hz respectively. It is discussed that the genetically predetermined preformation of spinal neuronal networks in the infants was immature. It seems that the early movements of infants are precursors of later locomotion. Since preformations of neuronal networks are not fixed, the primary stepping with its variations is a system designed to learn to walk or run from interactions with the periphery.
   Based on the similarities between the innervation during ontogenesis and lesion-induced reinnervation of muscle fibres by different types of motor axons in the frog, the neural maturation model and the system theory of infant motor development are compared to the reorganization of the CNS following spinal cord lesions especially with respect to micturition and stepping.
   In comparison to the Vojta physiotherapy, the oscillator formation training puts emphasis on the human-specific bipedal locomotion which is genetically predetermined. The rhythm training fits the self-organization of spinal neuronal networks for intergrative functions by changing rhythm couplings of oscillatory firing functional subnetworks (biological oscillators). Only little supraspinal drive is needed for the rhythmic stereotyped dynamic movements. Tetrapedal locomotion, not prominent after the birth, seems to be overstressed in the physiotherapy of spinal cord lesioned adult patients.

   syndrome: Results of 1993-5 case-control study for confidential inquiry
   into stillbirths and deaths in infancy
SO BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID POSITION
AB Objective-To investigate the role of sleeping arrangements as risk factors for the sudden infant death syndrome after a national risk reduction campaign.
   Design-Two year population based case-control study. Parental interviews were conducted for each infant who died and for four controls matched for age and date of interview.
   Setting-Three regions in England with a total population of 17 million people.
   Subjects-195 babies who died and 780 matched controls.
   Results-Prone and side sleeping positions both carried increased risks of death compared with supine when adjusted for maternal age, parity, gestation, birth weight, exposure to smoke, and other relevant factors in the sleeping environment (multivariate odds ratio = 9.00 (95% confidence interval 2.84 to 28.47) and 1.84 (1.02 to 3.31), respectively). The higher incidence of side rather than prone sleeping led to a higher population attributable risk (side 18.4%, prone 14.2%). More of the infants who died were found with bed covers over their heads (21.58; 6.21 to 74.99). The use of a dummy had an apparent protective effect (0.38; 0.21 to 0.70). Bed sharing for the whole night was a significant risk factor for infants whose mothers smoked (9.25; 2.31 to 34.02). No protective effect of breast feeding could be identified on multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions-This study confirms the importance of certain risk factors for the sudden infant death syndrome and identifies others-for example, covers over the head, side sleeping position-which may be amenable to change by educating and informing parents and health care professionals.

TI Smoking and the sudden infant death syndrome: Results from 1993-5
   case-control study for confidential inquiry into stillbirths and deaths
   in infancy
SO BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
ID SLEEPING POSITION; MATERNAL SMOKING; RISK
AB Objective-To investigate the effects of exposure to tobacco smoke and of parental consumption of alcohol and illegal drugs as risk factors for the sudden infant death syndrome after a national risk reduction campaign which included advice on prenatal and postnatal avoidance of tobacco smoke.
   Design-Two year population based case-control study. Parental interviews were conducted for each infant who died and four controls matched for age and date of interview.
   Setting-Three regions in England with a total population of 17 million people.
   Subjects-195 babies who died and 780 matched controls.
   Results-More index than control mothers (62.6% v 25.1%) smoked during pregnancy (multivariate odds ratio = 2.10; 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 3.54). Paternal smoking had an additional independent effect when other factors were controlled for (2.50; 1.48 to 4.22). The risk of death rose with increasing postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke, which had an additive effect among those also exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy (2.93; 1.56 to 5.48). The population attributable risk was over 61%, which implies that the numbers of deaths from the syndrome could be reduced by almost two third if parents did not smoke. Alcohol use was higher among index than control mothers but was strongly correlated with smoking and on multivariate analysis was not found to have any additional independent effect. Illegal drug use was more common among the index parents, and paternal use of illegal drugs remained significant in the multivariate model (4.68; 1.56 to 14.05).
   Conclusions-This study confirms the increased risk of the sudden infant death syndrome associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy and shows evidence that household exposure to tobacco smoke has an independent additive effect. Parental drug misuse has an additional small but significant effect.

AB General pharmacological effects of recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were investigated.
   1. Central nervous system: Basic FGF produced almost no effect on the general symptoms and behaviors of mice. Basic FGF did not influence the spontaneous motor activity, hexobarbital-induced anesthesia, electroshock seizure threshold, pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure in mice and normal body temperature and spinal reflex in rats up to a dose of 1 mg/kg (s.c., i.v.). As regards pain sensation, it inhibited the acetic acid-induced writhing at 1 mg/kg (s.c.). No abnormal waves were observed in spontaneous EEG of the rabbit up to 1 mg/kg (i.v.) of bFGF, but at 0.1 mg/kg it had a slight effect on the ratio of EEG levels and at 1 mg/kg induced an increase in rest period, disappearance in the period of fast wave sleep and a decrease in the period of deep sleep.
   2. Somatic nervous system: Basic FGF did not influence the corneal reflex, twitch response of the skin and diaphragm-phrenic nerve preparations.
   3. Autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle: Basic FGF showed little effects on the spontaneous movement of the isolated ileum, contraction induced by various agonists in isolated ileum, resting tension and noradrenaline(NA)-induced contraction of the aorta, resting tension and histamine-induced contraction of isolated trachea, spontaneous movement and 5-HT-induced contraction of isolated strips of stomach fundus, NA-induced contraction of isolated vas deferens of the rat up to the concentration of 10(-4) g/ml. Basic FGF augmented the tone of the isolated non-pregnant uterus at the concentrations of 10(-5) g/ml and above and inhibited or tended to inhibit the contractile tension of non-pregnant or pregnant uterus at 10(-4) g/ml, but it did not influence the spontaneous movement of the uterus, either the nonpregnant or pregnant, under in situ conditions even at a dose of 1 mg/kg (i.v.). Basic FGF did not influence the pupil size.
   4. Respiratory and circulatory systems: Basic FGF had no effect on the isolated heart. The influence was not exerted on the heart rate for the isolated atria but slight inhibition of contractile force was observed at 10(-4) g/ml. In anesthetized dogs a decrease in blood pressure, a slight increase in heart rate and respiratory rate and a decrease in femoral blood flow were observed at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.) of bFGF. Similarly, a slight increase in heart rate and a slight decrease of blood pressure were observed at 1 mg/kg (s.c.) in conscious rats.
   5. Digestive system: Administration of bFGF at 1 mg/kg did not result in changes in the transport capacity within the gastrointestinal tract (s.c., i.v.) and the secretion of the gastric juice (s.c.).
   6. Urine output and electrolyte metabolism: Basic FGF produced a decrease in urinary Na(+) excretion at 1 mg/kg (s.c.), and showed a tendency to increase in urinary volume at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.). At 1 mg/kg (i.v.) urinary excretion of Na(+) and Cl(-) was decreased significantly. It had no effect on the ability of rats to excrete PSP (phenol red) up to 1 mg/kg (s.c.).
   7. Blood system: Basic FGF did not influence the coagulation time of the whole blood, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time of rats up to 1 mg/kg (s.c., i.v.). It did not influence the aggregation of rabbit platelets induced by collagen and ADP up to 10(-4) g/ml. Basic FGF at concentration of 10(-4) g/ml exhibited no hemolytic action.
   8. Local action: Plantar subcutaneous injection of bFGF at above 0.005 mg/site induced edema by itself on and after the next day, and also reinforced carrageenin-induced edema from 1 day after injection.
   The results show that bFGF did not produce any acute effects on the somatic nervous system, autonomic nervous system, smooth muscle and blood system. In contrast, bFGF produced slight effects on the circulatory system, central nervous system and kidney function when injected systemically. Subcutaneous administration may produce edema at the site of injection.

AB Prostaglandin D-2 (PGD(2)) synthase is responsible for PGD(2) production in the brain, Western blot analysis of human amniotic fluid and probing with a polyclonal antibody against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) revealed a strong immunoreactive band with a molecular mass of 25 kDa, The immunoreactive species, which does not react with monoclonal anti-PSA antibodies, was purified to homogeneity from 1 L of amniotic fluid through successive cycles of gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. Amino acid sequence analysis (15 cycles) revealed that the protein was highly homologous or identical to PGD(2) synthase. On semiquantitative analysis, PGD(2) synthase concentration appears to increase dramatically during gestational weeks 12-25 and then declines slowly until term, PGD(2) synthase concentration in amniotic fluid was altered in many abnormal pregnancies, most notably its decrease in trisomic fetuses and fetuses with renal abnormalities.

AB Objectives: (1) To develop an image analysis method for the measurement of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP); (2) To establish a correlation of urea-resistant fraction of NAP (URNAP)/NAP scoring between the manual and automated methods, and (3) to assess the value of URNAP/NAP in the prenatal screening of Down syndrome. Study Design: Slides from 15 unaffected controls were blindly scored by both methods. The Pearson test was used for correlation analysis. Slides from 15 Down syndrome pregnancies and 25 unaffected controls were scored manually. Results: A coefficient r = 0.93 was obtained comparing the URNAP/NAP scores generated by the two methods, Average time for scoring by the automated method was 8 min. The median URNAP/NAP values for Down syndrome and unaffected controls were 112/86.1 and 51/51.5, respectively. Conclusions: Scores obtained by both methods highly correlate. Automated scoring is threefold faster, Down syndrome cases have higher URNAP/NAP scores compared to unaffected controls, which suggests that URNAP/NAP is an extremely useful marker for mid-trimester prenatal screening.

AB We previously reported a marked enhancement of nocturnal sleep in pregnant and pseudopregnant rats and suggested a possible involvement of prolactin (PRL) in the modulation of sleep during pregnancy. In the present study, the release of PRL was blocked by a dopamine agonist, bromocriptine (CB-154), and time-course changes in sleep were analyzed in pregnant rats. After pregnancy was induced by fertile mating with males (Day I), rats (n = 5) were injected with 1 mg of CB-154 subcutaneously 3 h before the onset of darkness for a 3-day period (Days 1-3 or 6-8). Electroencephalogram and electromyogram for evaluating the state of sleep and wakefulness were monitored continuously up to the reappearance of an estrous cycle in the treated rats. The CB-154 treatment resulted in abortion in all rats and suppressed the pregnancy-associated nocturnal increase in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS). The CB-154 treatment also decreased the diurnal amount of NREMS significantly. The sleep-suppressing effect of CB-154 on Days 6-8 was induced more promptly than that on Days 1-3. In the night of proestrus following the termination of pregnancy (Day 4 or Day 12), both NREMS and REMS decreased to the baseline level observed at prepregnant proestrus. Thus, our results indicated that CB-154 neutralized the pregnancy-associated sleep changes, which might be due to the inhibition of the PRL release. It is suggested that PRL is at least partially responsible for the regulation of sleep during pregnancy.

AB A 24-h rhythm of plasma PRL is present in fetal sheep. This rhythm is synchronized to an environmental clue (zeitgeber). We determined whether the light-dark cycle (L:D) is a zeitgeber for the fetal PRL rhythm and, if so, whether the mother might convey this zeitgeber to the fetus. We kept nine ewes (twin pregnancies) in constant light (L:L) and five ewes (singleton) in 14:10 L:D from 110 days gestation. Fetuses and mothers were catheterized at 119 days gestation. Blood samples were taken hourly for 24 h after 16 days under L:L or L:D. A mean 24-h rhythm of PRL was found (by RIA) in fetuses under L:D, but not in those under L:L. However, fetuses under L:L showed individual 24-h PRL rhythms (cosinor analysis) whose acrophases were distributed around the clock. Nonsynchronized rhythms persisted after 23 and 30 days of L:L. Acrophases of PRL rhythms within a set of twins were closer than those between sets, suggesting that twins were responding to a common signal. These findings indicate that the L:D cycle is a zeitgeber for the PRL rhythm in fetal sheep and suggest that the mother might convey the zeitgeber.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine resting body temperature (BT) and heart rate (HR) of healthy pregnant women in Japan and the United States, and if differences exist, to examine if fetal HR and fetal behavior also vary between the groups.
   Methods: A convenience sample (n = 49) was applied to the study with a cross-sectional design at two data sites (the Kansai region of Japan and the Midwest region of the United States) involving three subgroups, namely Japanese, African-American, and European-American. Healthy volunteers at late gestation (37.2 +/- 1.0 weeks; mean +/- SD) were recruited. Subjects sat quietly for 30 min in a controlled environment before the data collection began. Maternal BT was measured multiple times by an infrared thermometer, and HR was measured at the radial pulse for 30 s. Both measurements were repeated at 10-min intervals. Fetal heart rate (FHR) and fetal behavior were measured continuously for 60 min by a fetal actocardiograph.
   Results: Significant differences in BT among the three groups were evident. The mean BT and HR of Japanese participants were significantly lower (35.7 +/- 0.5 degrees C; 72.1 +/- 6.3 beats/min) than those in their other groups (36.8 +/- 0.6 degrees C; 86.2 +/- 11.4 bpm for African-Americans and 36.7 +/- 0.9 degrees C; 80.9 +/- 11.1 bpm for European-Americans) (P < 0.05, ANOVA). The mean FHR of European-Americans and was significantly lower (129 +/- 3.5 bpm) than those in the other groups (138 +/- 8.0 bpm for African-Americans and 135 +/- 9.5 bpm for Japanese) (P < 0.05, analysis of variance (ANOVA)). European-American fetuses also spent significantly more time in the active sleep phase (P < 0.05, Tukey-HSD). Maternal HR correlated with FHR (r = 0.33; P = 0.01) and with maternal BT (r = 0.27; P = 0.01).
   Conclusions: Different populations present different normal resting physiological conditions. Given the difference among populations studied, FHR correlates with maternal HR and BT but not with birth weight.

AB Objective. Prematurity has been associated with prenatal cocaine exposure, but most studies on the behavioral effects of prenatal cocaine exposure have been restricted to full-term infant samples. The current study focused on behavioral and hormonal responses in preterm cocaine-exposed infants compared with a cohort of non-cocaine-exposed infants of similar gestational age.
   Methodology. A comparison between 30 cocaine-exposed and 30 non-cocaine-exposed preterm neonates suggested that the cocaine-exposed neonates were born to mothers who had higher parity and more obstetric complications. In addition, mothers of cocaine-exposed preterm neonates visited, touched, held, and fed their infants less frequently than mothers of nonexposed infants.
   Results. The cocaine-exposed infants had smaller head circumferences at birth, spent more time in the neonatal intensive care unit, and had a greater incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhages. They also had inferior Brazelton cluster scores, including lower state regulation and range-of-state scores, and greater depression. During sleep-wake behavior observations, they showed difficulty maintaining alert states and self-regulating their behavior, and they spent more time in indeterminate sleep and had decreased periods of quiet sleep and increased levels of agitated behavior, including tremulousness, mouthing, multiple limb movements, and clenched fists. Finally, higher urinary norepinephrine, dopamine, and cortisol levels and lower plasma insulin levels were noted in the cocaine-exposed preterm neonates.
   Conclusions. These findings highlight the need for follow-up assessments and early intervention.

DE plagiocephaly; sleep position; synostosis; sudden infant death syndrome
AB Objective. To verify and determine the cause of an increase in the referral of infants with plagiocephaly without synostosis (PWS) to a single tertiary craniofacial center.
   Design. A chart review was performed for 269 infants with a diagnosis of PWS who presented to a single tertiary craniofacial center between 1979 and 1994. The pattern of referral for PWS was analyzed using both simple linear regression and time series regression analyses. In addition, the referral pattern for PWS was compared with that for infants seen at the same center who received a diagnosis of synostotic plagiocephaly. Changes in the distribution of several demographic, perinatal, and clinical variables during the study period were also assessed. Finally, in an effort to identify correlates of the risk of PWS developing, characteristics of patients who were Missouri residents and presented between 1992 and 1994 were evaluated and compared with those of the 1993 Missouri live birth cohort.
   Setting. The Cleft Palate and Craniofacial Deformities Institute, St Louis Children's Hospital, Washington University Medical Center.
   Results. The average annual number of referrals to our center for PWS in the period 1992 to 1994 was more than sixfold greater than that for the preceding 13 years. There was a statistically significant increase in the annual number of referrals to our center during the 16-year study period. Moreover, there was evidence that the average annual increase in referrals was significantly greater during the last 3 years (1992 through 1994) of the study than in the first 13 years. This shift in the referral patterns is roughly contemporaneous with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations regarding infant sleep position. There was no evidence that either the mean number of referrals or the average annual increase in referrals for patients with synostosis changed during the study period. Among patients with PWS, the average age at presentation did not change during the study period. There were also no significant changes in the distribution of other demographic, perinatal, and clinical variables. When compared with the Missouri birth cohort, infants with PWS were significantly more likely to be boys and to have been delivered by forceps. There was also some evidence that patients with PWS were more likely to be born prematurely and to be products of multiple-gestation pregnancies. These associations were, however, of only borderline statistical significance.
   Conclusion. Referrals to our center for PWS increased markedly in 1992 relative to previous years. The temporal coincidence of this increase with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation to avoid the prone sleeping position, to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, suggests a possible causal relationship. If this association is causal, education regarding the need for head position rotation coupled with that for sudden infant death syndrome should obviate positional PWS.

DT Article
DE multiple pregnancy; breathing patterns; oxygenation; sleep quality
ID APNEA
AB OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to study whether multiple pregnancy at the third trimester predisposes to breathing disturbances and arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation during sleep.
   STUDY DESIGN: Nocturnal breathing, oxygenation, and movement activity were studied in 10 mothers: 8 with twins, 1 with triplets, and 1 with quadruplets.
   RESULTS: No obstructive and few central sleep apnea episodes were observed. Four subjects had episodes of increased respiratory resistance, but only one, the mother with quadruplets, was significantly affected. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was always maintained above 90%. Periodic leg movements were present in all mothers, with a frequency range of 3.7 to 49.7 movements per hour.
   CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the large uterus in multiple pregnancy, nocturnal breathing and oxygenation are well maintained. Increased motor activity and frequent awakenings suggest poor sleep quality, which may be further compromised by intensive periodic leg movements.

AB Comparison of 1 mg Gemeprost-Vaginal Suppositories Serial Application versus Sulproston i.v.: Three different regimens for the termination of second and third trimester pregnancies by the use of prostaglandins (PG) were compared in a retrospective analysis. In group A (n = 16) terminations were attempted by continuous i.v. infusion of Sulproston 9 hours after administration of a 3 mg-PGE(2)-vaginal tablet overnight. in group B (n = 22), i,v, Sulproston was started 2 hours after priming with 1 mg Gemeprost-vaginal suppositories. The outcome of these two regimens was compared with that of repeated administration of 1 mg Gemeprost-vaginal suppositories at 6-hourly intervals (group C, n = 25). In each group, if uterine contractions failed to appear after one day, the treatment was discontinued for a sleep rest over night acid then resumed, Genetic disorders or fetal malformations were the most frequent reasons for termination. Patients with intrauterine fetal demise, rupture of the membranes, preterm labour or a ripe cervix (Bishop Score >3) were excluded. Median time intervals from induction to abortion were 33 hours in group A and: 23 hours in each Group B and C. The rate of fetal expulsions within 12, 24 and 36 hours in groups B and C were similar. Women of parity greater than or equal to 1 showed significantly shorter intervals than nulliparae in groups A and C. Only one woman (in group A) failed to expel after induction, in four other cases (in groups A and B) complications (local thrombophlebitis, bronchospasm) were noted. The serial administration of 1 mg Gemeprost-vaginal suppositories at 6-hourly intervals showed fewer side effects and seems to be as efficient as sulproston i.v. after cervical ripening.

AB Recent studies have shown that full term neonates actively secrete melatonin and that light deprivation during the first 72 h of life significantly increases plasma melatonin levels, In order to evaluate pineal gland activity and responsiveness to light in premature infants, we measured plasma melatonin levels in 23 healthy infants, 33-36 weeks of gestation, during their first week of life, Nine infants (Group A) remained under constant illumination conditions for 48 hour prior to melatonin measurements. Fourteen infants (Group B) were exposed for the same time period to an artificial alternation of day and night cycles by covering the eyes of the infants with eye pads during the night (20.00-08.00 h), Mean +/- SEM plasma melatonin at 20.00 h, 04.00 h, 12.00 h and 20.00 h was 14.8 +/- 1.6, 16.2 +/- 2.8, 18.7 +/- 3.1, 20.9 +/- 3.1 pg/ml in Group A and 28.5 +/- 3.2, 22.3 +/- 2.9, 20.2 +/- 2.2, 18.5 +/- 2.2 pg/ml in Group B respectively. The differences observed between the two were not statistically significant, Our indicate that at this gestational age the pineal gland is actively secreting melatonin but does not respond to the light alternations attempted, Further studies are needed in order to evaluate the developmental maturation of the pineal gland in humans.

ID COT DEATH
AB Objective: To determine whether the prone sleep position was associated with an increased risk of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
   Study design: Population-based case-control study.
   Participants: Case subjects were infants who died of SIDS in King County, Washington. Control subjects were randomly selected infants born in King County, Up to four control subjects were matched on date of birth to each case subject.
   Methods: During the study period, November 1992 through October 1994, sleep-position data were collected on infants who died of SIDS by the King County Medical Examiner's Office during their investigation of the deaths, Parents of infants chosen as control subjects were contacted by telephone, and sleep position information was obtained, Infants who usually slept on their abdomen were classified as sleeping prone; those who usually slept on the side or back were categorized as sleeping nonprone, The adjusted odds ratio for prone sleep position as a risk factor for SIDS was calculated with conditional logistic regression after control for race, birth weight, maternal age, maternal marital status, household income, and maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy.
   Results: Sleep position data were collected on 47 infants with SIDS (77% of eligible infants) and 142 matched control subjects; 57.4% of infants who died of SIDS usually slept prone versus 24.6% of control subjects (p < 0.00001). The unadjusted odds ratio for prone sleep position as a risk factor for SIDS was 4.69 (95% confidence interval: 2.17, 10.17), After control for potentially confounding variables, the adjusted odds ratio for prone sleep position was 3.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.08, 9.03).
   Conclusion: Prone sleep position was significantly associated with an increased risk of SIDS among a group of American infants.

AB Beside well-established clinical benefits, the current doses of oestrogens may induce clinical side-effects leading to non-compliance and loss of efficacy. During a normal menstrual cycle the incidence of any cyclic discomfort is consistently reported to be lowest during the mid-follicular phase when plasma E2 remains between 60 and 150 pg/ml. The incidence of pregnancy-like symptoms such as bloating, breast tenderness and mood swings tends to increase in mid-luteal phase when E2 increases upto 150 pg/ml. On the other hand incidence of asthenia, sleep disturbances, depressive mood, headaches and migraines increase during perimenstrual days when E2 drops to 40 pg/ml or below. Accordingly experimental and human studies in castrated animals and postmenopausal women suggest that plasma E2 around 100 pg/ml is optimal for treatment of hot flushes, prevention of bone loss and cardiovascular protection. Due to large interindividual variation in estrogen clearance rate, it is unlikely that any standardized unique dose of oral or non-oral formulations will reproduce the optimal levels in all postmenopausal users. Efforts for individual titration are mandatory to improve compliance and actual efficacy on a long term. Because older postmenopausal women tend to have a better clinical tolerance to low E2 levels, objective markers of efficacy should also be identified when the aim of HRT is the prevention of osteoporosis or vascular diseases. In addition clinical and metabolic side-effects related to added progestins can be substantially reduced by the use of lower dose inducing amenorrhea and by progesterone instead of synthetic steroids.

AB Immunological monitoring of disease progression following HIV infection and seroconversion illness, latency and AIDS, not only helps in the basic investigation of the natural history of the viral infection in man, but also can assist in prognosis and treatment of AIDS-defining illnesses. However, outside clinical trials, these tests should be selected and used in clinical practice only if they are validated as relevant and effective. The absolute CD4+ T-helper lymphocyte count, measured by flow cytometry, has emerged as the best available investigation, but needs care in sampling due to diurnal and circadian rhythms, effects of age, pregnancy, therapy, intercurrent infections and technique. Sampling should provide a baseline and trends - monthly intervals initially, then quarterly in uncomplicated cases. Thresholds may be given for counts (e.g. 200/mu l) below which prophylaxis against pneumocystis pneumonia should be administered, and repeating persistently low counts (e.g. below 50/mu/l) is seldom helpful in practice. Serum levels of beta-2 microglobulin, neopterin and immunoglobulins rarely add information. Physicians and laboratories should have testing guidelines based on clinical audit of best practice, based in turn on scientific understanding of the immunological processes involved.

AB The corpus luteum, one of the biological clocks of the estrous cycle and pregnancy, is known foremost for its production of progesterone that blocks the pituitary release of gonadotropins and prepares the uterus for a pregnancy. The cellular sources of this progesterone are the steroidogenic small and large luteal cells. Other luteal cells that are not steroidogenic, but are believed to have an important role in the function of this gland are the fibroblast, macrophages and endothelial cells. The most prominent luteal cell is the large steroidogenic cell characterized by an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and densely packed spherical mitochondria that are indicative of its contribution to most of the circulating progesterone believed to be constitutively secreted and not under the control of LH. Other distinguishing features of the large luteal cell are the presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum, prominent Golgi, and secretory granules that are indicative of endocrine cells. This cell undergoes dynamic changes across the estrous cycle and pregnancy, believed to reflect a change in progesterone and protein secretion that will eventually influence a successful pregnancy or another ovulation if pregnancy fails. The morphological, characteristics of the bovine luteal cells are the focus of this review.

AB Objectives: To determine the incidence of self-reported snoring in pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. To compare indicators of fetal outcome in pregnant women with self-reported frequent snoring vs those without snoring.
   Study design: Prospective, nonrandomized screening and comparison between groups.
   Patients: Three hundred fifty pregnant women and 110 age-matched nonpregnant women.
   Methods: Survey evaluating self-reported snoring. For the pregnant women, infant birthweight, APGAR scores, and other indicators of fetal outcome were obtained by record review.
   Results: Frequent snoring was reported in 14% of the pregnant women vs 4% of the nonpregnant women (chi(2)=6.2; df=1; p<0.05). The pregnant women who reported frequent snoring did not have deliveries resulting in infants with evidence of an increase in compromised outcomes.
   Conclusions: Frequent snoring is reported more often in pregnant than in nonpregnant women. Snoring mothers do not appear to be at increased risk for delivering infants with fetal compromise as might be expected with the concomitant occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea.

AB OBJECTIVE The third trimester of pregnancy is characterized by a mildly hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, possibly driven by elevated circulating levels of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) of placental origin. In-vitro studies have demonstrated that glucocorticoids and oestrogen stimulate while progesterone inhibits the expression of CRH mRNA and/or protein, suggesting that several potential interactions between the placenta and the HPA axis may exist.
   DESIGN AND PATIENTS To investigate the detailed pattern of circulating immunoreactive (ir) CRH, ACTH, cortisol, oestradiol and progesterone during the third trimester of pregnancy, plasma samples were drawn serially every 30 minutes from 22 healthy pregnant women (age 32.0 +/- 1.1 years, mean +/- SE) between the 34th and 36th week of gestation. Ten women had plasma samples drawn between 0800 h and 2000 h (daytime group), and 12 between 2000 h and 0300 h (night-time group). The hormone concentrations obtained were analysed for pulsatility by the Detect program, for detection of circadian rhythmicity by comparison between the first and second 6-hour periods within each group by Student's t-test, and for time-dependent correlations by cross-correlation analysis.
   RESULTS All five hormones were secreted in a pulsatile fashion. There was no apparent circadian rhythm of CRH or oestradiol secretion, whereas there was a clear circadian rhythm in plasma ACTH, cortisol and progesterone secretion, with the latter in reverse phase (P<0.05). No significant correlations were observed between CRH and ACTH, whereas, as expected, ACTH and cortisol concentrations were strongly correlated with each other over time (r = 0.32 and 0.70 at lag time 30 minutes for the daytime and night-time groups, respectively), with ACTH leading cortisol. A weak positive correlation was observed between CRH and cortisol concentrations for the night-time group at lag time 0 minute, suggesting that the latter may have a positive effect on the former in vivo.
   CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that placental CRH, although pulsatile, drives quantitatively the maternal HPA axis in the third trimester of pregnancy in a non-circadian, non-pulsatile fashion. The maternal HPA axis is probably driven in a circadian and pulsatile fashion by another major ACTH secretagogue, most likely AVP of parvocellular paraventricular nucleus origin.

AB The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlations between retrospective and prospective assessments of sleep. Subjective reports of sleep characteristics and sleep quality were obtained from 146 young (20-40 years, average age 29.15) healthy men (n = 43), nonpregnant (n = 70) and pregnant women (n = 33). Three types of subjective sleep reports were obtained: (1) general estimates of sleep habits (retrospective measures); (2) sleep logs completed upon awakening on three successive workdays (prospective measures); and (3) general sleep complaints. Men showed the greatest stability in the sleep log reports, followed by nonpregnant women, with pregnant women showing the least stability. Significant positive correlations between prospective (log reported) and retrospective (general estimates) sleep measures were found only for men. However, for measures of sleep quality, such as feelings of fatigue upon awakening, women showed greater agreement between their general estimates and three nightly reports. The limitations of using retrospective estimates in sleep surveys are discussed.

The statistical method was cosinor analysis and this established seasonality of SIDS death and births, the extent of this seasonality (amplitude) and the position of the peak (acrophase). There is a lowering of risk, by one third amongst babies born in February-May compared to those born in August November The seasonal variation of death was twice as great for births in September as compared with those in April. Those born in May-June lived on average six weeks longer than those born in November-April. Advice on subsequent pregnancy delivery date should be given to families who have already experienced SIDS. For those born in autumn there may be two Components - the first a genetic or intrauterine component independent of month of birth, and the second an independent effect of interaction with winter environment.

AB Four-hour recordings of heart rate and respiration during spontaneous sleep and wakefulness were obtained from 17 cocaine-exposed and 14 control infants at 2 weeks of age. The median values for heart and respiratory rate and variability were determined for each 1-min epoch of quiet and active sleep. Overall mean rates and variabilities were determined for each state. The cocaine-exposed infants showed significantly greater sleep state effects on heart rate relative to the control infants. Recency of cocaine exposure was not a factor in the differences; even those cocaine-exposed infants who tested negative for the drug perinatally differed significantly from those who had never been exposed. Heart rate variability was increased in cocaine-exposed infants relative to controls in both sleep states. Respiratory rate and variability were not significantly different in the cocaine-exposed and control infants. These results suggest differences in cardiovascular control in infants of cocaine-abusing mothers compared to infants without cocaine exposure. The mechanism responsible for these differences is unclear and may reflect cocaine-induced changes in the autonomic physiology of developing infants or some indirect effect of maternal cocaine use.

AB The circadian rhythms of fetal and neonatal rodents are entrained by their mother. This entrainment is dependent upon the maternal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but the mechanism of entrainment is unknown. Administration of the pineal hormone melatonin to pregnant, SCN-lesioned female Syrian hamsters entrains the activity rhythms of their hamster pups. The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin injected directly in neonatal Syrian hamsters is able to entrain circadian rhythms and, if so, for how long this effect persists during development. Injection of melatonin in two groups of hamster pups at opposite phases on postnatal days 1-5 entrained the onset of activity rhythms on the day of weaning to two phases 10.67 h apart. Melatonin injection did not entrain activity rhythms to opposite phases on either postnatal days 6-10 or 21-25. Vehicle injection did not entrain animals to opposite phases at any of the ages studied. These results demonstrate that melatonin is able to act directly on the neonate to cause entrainment and that this effect disappears after postnatal day 6.

DT Article
DE sodium valproate; embryotoxicity; chronotoxicity
ID MICE; ACID
AB The influence of dosing time on the embryotoxicity of sodium valproate (valproic acid, VPA) was investigated in ICR mice under a light-dark (12: 12) cycle. A significant circadian rhythm was shown for VPA-induced embryotoxicity, with the highest value at 1700 and the lowest at 0100. A similar pattern of rhythm was also shown for VPA-induced toxicity in pregnant and nonpregnant mice. No significant dosing time-dependent difference between injection at 1700 and 0100 was demonstrated for VPA concentrations in the embryo, plasma and brain. The rhythm in the embryotoxicity seems to be related to the rhythm in the sensitivity of the embryo and dam to the drug. Embryotoxicity and VPA concentrations were significantly higher on gestational day 13 than day 7. The pharmacokinetics of VPA contribute, at least partly, to the gestational stage-dependent embryotoxicity of VPA. The timing of drug administration (i.e., gestational stage and circadian phase) appears to be essential for studies on the embryotoxicity of VPA in mice.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the sleep-wake patterns of fullterm (greater than or equal to 37 weeks) newborns and to evaluate the effects of specific factors including maternal gestational diabetes, infant size and anthropometric measures, gender, gestational age and delivery variables. Methods: Two-hundred twenty newborns were studied in the hospital nursery for a continuous 24-h period with miniature activity monitors attached to the infants' ankles. The sample consisted of 102 infants of gestational diabetic mothers (IGDM) and 118 controls, Anthropometric measurements were obtained and maternal and infant characteristics were recorded, Results: The newborns had a discernible diurnal sleep pattern and slept twice as much during the nighttime as daytime hours (P < 0.001). Higher skinfold measurements correlated significantly with increased quiet and motionless sleep (P < 0.05) for the IGDM but not for controls. Sleep of infants born at later gestational ages was characterized by increased percent of quiet and motionless sleep (P < 0.0001), No direct gender effects were identified. Conclusions: Multiple factors were associated with the sleep-wake patterns of the newborns on our study cohort including maternal glucose values during pregnancy, increased measures of adiposity in IGDM, increased gestational age, mode of delivery and delivery Sequence. Investigation of the sleep-wake characteristics of neonates using activity monitors is a noninvasive method for gaining new understanding of the relationships between sleep wake activity patterns and infant characteristics.

AB Restless legs syndrome is characterized by unpleasant, deep-seated paresthesias in the legs and sometimes the arms. These sensations occur at rest and are relieved by movement, Sleep disturbance is common. Many patients also have periodic movements of sleep, Mild symptoms of restless legs occur in up to 5% of the population. Restless legs syndrome is idiopathic in most patients, but it may be the presenting feature of iron deficiency and is also common in uremia, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and polyneuropathy, Treatment of the underlying cause, when possible, usually relieves the symptoms. For patients with severe symptoms, levodopa, bromocriptine mesylate, opioids, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and clonidine hydrochloride have proved to be effective.

AB Objective: The purpose of this article is to review the literature concerning gender differences in the course of bipolar illness and discuss issues relevant to the treatment of women with the illness. Method: The literature concerning the following topics is reviewed: gender differences in the course of bipolar illness; effects of the female reproductive cycle on the course of bipolar illness; special considerations in the treatment of bipolar women (focusing on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axes); and hypotheses to explain the greater prevalence of rapid cycling among bipolar women than among bipolar men. Results: Data clearly indicate that rapid cycling among bipolar women. Data also suggest that bipolar women may have more depressive episodes (and fewer manic episodes) and may be more likely to suffer from mixed (as opposed to pure) mania than bipolar men. While it is clear that bipolar women are at high risk for postpartum episodes, the effects of other reproductive system events (i.e., puberty, menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause, use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy) on the course of treatment of bipolar illness have received little systematic study. It is unclear whether women are at higher risk than men for developing lithium-induced hypothyroidism. Higher rates of hypothyroidism, greater use of antidepressant, and gonadal steroid effects are possible explanations for the greater prevalence of rapid cycling among bipolar women. Conclusions: Gender differences in bipolar illness and the effects of the female reproductive system on the course and treatment of the illness deserve more study. The importance of a longitudinal approach to these questions is emphasized.

AB Shift work, in particular night work, can have a negative impact on health and well-being of workers as it can cause: (a) disturbances of the normal circadian rhythms of the psycho-physiological functions, beginning with the sleep/wake cycle; (b) interferences with work performance and efficiency over the 24 hour span, with consequent errors and accidents; (c) difficulties in maintaining the usual relationships both at family and social level, with consequent negative influences on marital relations, care of children and social contacts; (d) deterioration of health that can be manifested in disturbances of sleeping and eating habits and, in the long run, in more severe disorders that deal prevalently with the gastrointestinal (colitis, gastroduodenitis and peptic ulcer), neuro-psychic (chronic fatigue, anxiety, depression) and, probably, cardiovascular (hypertension, ischemic heart diseases) functions. Besides, shift and night work may have more specific adverse effects on women's health both in relation to their particular hormonal and reproductive function, and their family roles. It has been estimated that about 20% of all workers have to leave shift work in a very short time because of serious disturbances; those remaining in shift work show different levels of (mal)adaptation and (in)tolerance, that can become more or less manifest in different times, and with different intensity. In fact, the effects of such stress condition can vary widely among the shift workers in relation to many 'intervening variables' concerning both individual factors (e.g. age, personality traits, physiological characteristics), as well as working situations (e.g. work loads, shift schedules) and social conditions (e.g, number and age of children, housing, commuting).

   physical activity level
ID WOMEN
AB Objectives: To describe average levels of free-living energy expenditure in people from affluent societies and to determine the influence of body weight, height, age and sex.
   Design: Analysis of 574 measurements of total energy expenditure (TEE, assessed by the doubly-labelled water method); basal metabolic rate (BMR, directly measured or derived from similar directly measured proxy measures such as during sleep); activity energy expenditure (AEE, derived as TEE - BMR); and physical activity level (PAL, derived as TEE/BMR) from people aged 2-95 years. The dataset was extracted from 1614 published and unpublished measurements in 1156 subjects after exclusion of repeat estimates and subjects in special physiological or behavioural states (eg pregnancy, athletic or military training etc).
   Results: A separate analysis of data from non-ambulant subjects, and from elite endurance athletes (ail excluded from the main dataset) established the limits of human daily energy expenditure at around 1.2 x BMR and 4.5 x BMR. In the main analysis, the validity of PAL as an index of TEE adjusted for BMR was tested and confirmed. Regression equations were then derived to describe TEE, BMR, AEE and PAL in terms of body weight, height, age and sex. As anticipated, TEE, BMR and AEE were all positively related to weight and height, while age was a negative predictor, especially of activity. The influence of weight disappeared when TEE was expressed as PAL, but height and age remained as highly significant predictors. For all three components, females expended 11% less energy on average than males after adjustment for weight, height and age. Average levels of energy expenditure in different age and sex groups are tabulated.
   Conclusions: There now exists a large and robust database of energy expenditure measurements obtained by the doubly-labelled water method. Analysis of the data from affluent societies shows that, in general, levels of energy expenditure are similar to the recommendations for energy requirements adopted by FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) and UK Department of Health (1991). PAL values for active subjects tend to be higher than is currently assumed. The current analysis provides a substantial body of normal data against which other estimates can be compared.

TI Diurnal blood pressure difference in the assessment of preeclampsia
SO OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PREGNANCY; SLEEP
AB Objective: To evaluate diurnal variation in blood pressure (BP) in normal gravidas and those with preeclampsia, using ambulatory BP monitoring.
   Methods: A cross-sectional comparative observational study was performed in three teaching hospital maternity units. Twenty-four normotensive and 24 preeclamptic women who were similar in age, weight, and mean duration of gestation (35 weeks) were studied. Diurnal variation and BP measurement were assessed using ambulatory BP monitors validated for use in pregnancy and for which normal reference ranges for pregnancy have been derived.
   Results: At night, the BP fall was less in preeclamptic women than in normotensive women. The day-night BP difference decreased as average BP rose (diastolic gradient = -0.54 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.77 to -0.31], systolic gradient = -0.36 [95% CI -0.58 to -0.14], where gradient denotes a unit increase in BP leading to an increase or decrease in the day-night difference).
   Conclusion: The decrease in day-night BP difference observed in preeclampsia is inversely related to average BP. This blunting of the day-night BP difference may be a useful adjunctive measure of disease severity in preeclampsia.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in sleep patterns during pregnancy to better understand sleep regulation during pregnancy. We uninterruptedly recorded electroencephalogram (EEG),electromyogram (EMG), and brain temperature (Tbr) throughout pregnancy in rats. The duration of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep decreased after day 5 of pregnancy associated with an inverse increase in the number of non-REM sleep episodes. Thus, the amount of total non-REM sleep time remained constant throughout pregnancy. The amount of total REM sleep time decreased on day 17 of pregnancy after which the reduced state was sustained. That was mainly due to a decrease in the number of REM sleep episodes. Brain temperature (Tbr) gradually decreased as pregnancy advanced, reaching its lowest value 3 days before delivery. These observations provide a better understanding of the sleep patterns during pregnancy, and useful information for investigation of mechanisms of sleep regulation during pregnancy.

AB To elucidate the mechanism of the resting-active cycles (RAG) of fetal heart rates (FHR), in the resting and non-resting phases (RP and NRP), 24-h FHR recordings were made on 16 normal full-term pregnant women. RP, NRP, RAC-1 (NRP-NRP cycle), and RAC-2 (RP-RP cycle) were defined based on the criteria of Nijhuis et al. Frequency distributions were plotted separately for the entire 24-h period as well as for the day-time (07:00-21:00 h) and night-time (21:00-07:00 h), and were compared using Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample tests. The mean durations (+/- S.D.) (min) of RP, NRP, RAC-1, and RAC-2 were 22.7 +/- 11.2, 67.3 +/- 47.2, 90.0 +/- 47.6, and 89.9 +/- 48.6 during 24-h periods, 20.1 +/- 7.7, 68.3 +/- 52.3, 88.6 +/- 53.1, and 88.4 +/- 53.0 during the day-time, and 25.4 +/- 13.2, 66.2 +/- 41.2, 91.4 +/- 41.0, and 91.5 +/- 43.4 during the night-time. Length of RP was the only factor significantly different during the day and night (P < 0.05). We propose that there are different mechanisms controlling RP and NRP.

AB Genetically based alcohol sensitivity may influence the severity of alcohol-related birth defects. To examine this question, measures of growth and survival were examined in offspring of the alcohol sensitive Long-Sleep (LS) and alcohol-resistant Short-Sleep (SS) mouse lines following prenatal ethanol exposure. Pregnant LS and SS mice received an ethanol dose of either 6 or 8 g/kg/day from days 7 through 18 of pregnancy. Control groups received a maltose-dextrin solution made isocaloric to the 8 g/kg/day dose. Ethanol and maltose-dextrin solutions were administered as split doses, 6 h apart, via gavage. Nonintubated lab chow control groups were also included for both mouse lines. Offspring were fostered at birth to lactating mice of an outbred stock. Pregnancy was longer for ethanol-treated LS darns compared to maltose-dextrin and lab chow LS control groups, whereas pregnancy length for ethanol-treated SS dams was similar to SS controls. Prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in dose-related growth deficits in LS but not in SS litters. Line differences in postnatal growth deficits in response to prenatal alcohol exposure suggest maternal or fetal alcohol sensitivity influence alcohol-related birth defects.

AB OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study the diurnal variation in angiotensin II sensitivity.
   STUDY DESIGN: Angiotensin sensitivity tests were performed at 9 AM and at 2 PM in 12 normotensive pregnant women, with each woman serving as her own control.
   RESULTS: In all patients the effective presser dose was higher in the afternoon.
   CONCLUSION: We suggest the greater sensitivity to angiotensin in the morning is related to an intrinsic circadian variation in vascular reactivity. When the result of an angiotensin sensitivity test is interpreted, the time of day it is performed should be taken into account.

DE thyrotropin; triiodothyronine; thyroxine; hormone regulation
ID THYROTROPIN; THYROXINE; CHILDHOOD
AB Thyroid hormone production is regulated via pituitary thyrotropin (TSH) modulation of thyroxine (T-4) prohormone secretion by the thyroid gland and regulation of active triiodothyronine (T-3) production in peripheral tissues via metabolic events influencing activities of the iodothyronine monodeiodinase enzyme systems. Control at both levels is developmentally regulated and modified in serious nonthyroidal illness (trauma, infection, cancer, metabolic diseases). Racial and gender differences are of little significance except for the effects of placental estrogens and chorionic gonadotropin during pregnancy. There is a circadian rhythm of TSH secretion, with peak values at the onset of sleep and nadir concentrations during the afternoon hours. Peak and nadir concentrations differ by similar to+/-50%. The effect on circulating T-4 and T-3 concentrations is not significant because of the large size of the extrathyroidal T-4 pool. In healthy subjects there is no significant impact of body weight, physical training, body habitus, posture, immobilization, exercise, or ambulatory status on thyroid function, and no significant geographic environmental variation. Nutrition also has a minimal impact except for variation in iodine intake. Subthreshold concentrations of iodine intake are associated with increased TSH secretion, goiter, increased thyroid iodine uptake, decreased T-4 production, an increased T-3/T-4 secretion ratio, and an increased ratio of circulating T-3/T-4 concentrations. Excessive iodine intake can block thyroid hormone biosynthesis by inhibiting the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic process, resulting in reduced T-4 secretion, increased TSH concentrations, goiter, and hypothyroidism if the iodine excess is chronic.

   RHYTHMS; PHOTOPERIOD; MYOMETRIAL; DELIVERY
AB A significant number of studies have demonstrated a rhythmicity in the time of day of birth. For day active mammals, the normal time of delivery is during the hours of darkness, while the converse is true for nocturnal animals. This concept also applies to human pregnancy. Both the start of labor and actual time of delivery appear to occur more frequently at night than other times of the day. Although the mechanism(s) regulating this pattern remains undefined, there seems to be a relationship to rhythms in hormone secretion. The underlying hypothesis suggests that rhythmic changes in circulating hormone concentrations have a profound influence on the contractile characteristics of the myometrium. The changing hormone concentrations result in rhythms in uterine contractions, with the peak of activity occurring at night. This ''temporal priming'' of the uterus may be responsible for the nocturnal dominance of the initiation of labor and parturition. Data from non-human primates also suggest a strong influence of photoperiod on these rhythms. However, the influence of light:dark cycles on endocrine and uterine activity patterns during human pregnancy has yet to be determined.

AB Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of an antiprogesterone (mifepristone, RU486; Roussel-Uclaf, Romaineville, France) on endometriosis.
   Design: An open, prospective clinical trial.
   Setting: The clinical practice of an academic faculty.
   Patients: Nine women with endometriosis were studied.
   Interventions: RU486 (50 mg/d) was administered for 6 months.
   Main Outcome Measures: Daily symptom inventories and urinary steroid metabolites were assessed before, during, and after treatment. Blood for hormone analysis was obtained weekly for 4 weeks and monthly thereafter. The extent of endometriosis, bone mineral density, circadian rhythm of cortisol, and LH pulsatility were determined before and after treatment. Safety laboratory measurements were made before and at 1, 2, and 6 months of treatment.
   Results: Pelvic pain and uterine cramping improved in all patients. Endometriosis regressed by 55%. All patients exhibited endocrine features of anovulatory amenorrhea without hypoestrogenism. A rise in serum LH and T levels was observed during the first month of treatment and one patient developed an elevation of liver transaminases during the last month of treatment. All other measurements were unchanged.
   Conclusion: RU486 appears to be effective in improving the symptoms and causing regression of endometriosis in the absence of significant side effects.

DE behavioral states; human fetus; state transition
ID FETAL BEHAVIORAL STATE; PREGNANCY; HEALTHY
AB Periods of no coincidence (PsNC) among state variables appear to be more predictive of neurobehavioral outcome than the amount of time spent in any particular behavioral state. It has recently been suggested that analysis of the ordering of state variables during a state transition may provide results equivalent to full state analysis. If this were the case. then there ought to be a relationship between the duration of PsNC and fetal heart rate (FHR)-fetal eve movement (FEM) sequencing at the time of a state change. To test this hypothesis, we compared full stare analysis with analysis of individual state transitions for 52 normal human fetuses between 38 and 42 weeks of gestation. For the study population as a whole, FHR was the first variable to change in 62 (77%) of 81 1F --> 2F transitions and FEM was the first variable to change in 50 (63%) of 79 2F --> 1F transitions (chi(2) = 67.9. p < 0.001). Ordering of FHR and FEM at the time of a stare change was reversed in 8 (67%) of 12 fetuses with PsNC greater than or equal to 15% and in only 6 (15%) of 40 fetuses with PsNC < 15% (chi(2) = 12.5, p < 0.001). We conclude that fetuses who exhibit poor state organization more often display a FHR-FEM sequence at the rime of a stare transition which is opposite that of fetuses with consierably better state control. However. since only one-third of fetuses with reversed FHR-FEM sequencing acutally exhibited more than one such episode, it is unlikely that isolated analysis of state transitions will provide a reliable measure of behavioral state organization in the individual fetus.

AB The dimensions of the three major axes of the thorax (longitudinal, transverse and antero-posterior) were monitored in utero from the ultrasonic transit-time between pairs of piezo-electric transducers chronically implanted at opposite sides of the thorax in five fetal sheep at 119-122 days of gestation; tracheal and vascular catheters and diaphragmatic EMG electrodes were also implanted. To measure thoracic length, ultrasound transducers were implanted on the diaphragm and over the upper sternum and manubrium sterni. A pair was implanted on opposite sides of the chest to measure thoracic width, and another pair was implanted over the lower thoracic spine and lower sternum (antero-posterior dimension). The width of the thorax either decreased (mean 0.6+/-0.2 mm) or increased (mean 0.7+/-0.1 mm) during fetal breathing movements (FBM). The depth of the thorax (antero-posterior dimension) usually decreased (mean 0.9+/-0.1 mm) during FBM. The distance between the upper sternum and the diaphragm decreased by 1.0+/-0.1 mm (left side) and 1.6+/-0.3 mm (right side) during inspiratory efforts. The distance between the upper thorax and a fixed point on the lower thoracic spine decreased by a similar amount. Overall, fetal thoracic dimensions changed by 1-3%. The largest changes measured, and the most surprising, were reductions, rather than increases, in the separation between the dome of the diaphragm and the upper thorax; this suggests that, during inspiratory efforts, the upper thorax moves caudally by a greater distance than the diaphragm. FBM induce complex and variable changes in thoracic dimensions; these are likely to induce small alterations in the shape of the lungs that may act as a stimulus to lung growth.

AB Eight time-dated pregnant ewes at 125 days' gestation (145 days = term) underwent surgery for placement of fetal vascular catheters, electrodes for recording fetal behavioural state, and maternal venous catheters. Three days later, fetal cerebral and myocardial blood flow were determined by the coloured microsphere technique under four conditions: (1) during rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, before fetal cocaine infusion, (2) 30 min after initiation of a cocaine infusion to the fetus at 0.2 mg/kg per min, (3) during REM sleep, before maternal cocaine infusion, and (4) 30 min after initiation of a cocaine infusion to the ewe at 0.3 mg/kg per min. Cocaine infusion directly to the fetal lamb did not cause hypoxaemia or significantly change cerebral or myocardial blood flow or oxygen delivery. Cocaine administered to the ewe led to a drop in fetal oxygen tension from 3.0 +/- 0.5 to 2.5 +/- 0.3 kPa (P < 0.0001) and in fetal oxygen content from 3.8 +/- 0.7 to 2.8 +/- 0.4 mmol O-2/L (P < 0.0001). Prior to maternal cocaine administration, fetal cerebral blood flow was 146 +/- 103 mL/100 g per min and during maternal cocaine infusion it went to 184 +/- 147 mL/100 g per min (P = NS) while myocardial blood flow increased from 156 +/- 92 to 333 +/- 178 mL/100 g per min (P < 0.002). This increase in blood flow negated the effects of hypoxaemia so that cerebral oxygen delivery was unaffected while myocardial oxygen delivery increased an average of 67%. It is concluded that cocaine administration to pregnant sheep does not impede fetal cerebral or myocardial oxygen delivery.

AB The effect of fetal thyroidectomy on thermoregulation in newborn lambs was investigated. Seven of 14 lambs born normally at term were thyroidectomized at Day 127 of gestation, Colonic temperature and oxygen consumption were measured during non-rapid eye movement sleep 6-45 h after birth. All lambs were then killed and perirenal brown adipose tissue was sampled for measurement of thermogenic activity (guanosine diphosphate binding), uncoupling protein and lipid contents.
   Thyroidectomized lambs tended to have a mean colonic temperature 2.35 degrees C lower (P = 0.067) than controls and two became hypothermic (i.e. colonic temperature <35 degrees C). Thyroidectomized lambs exhibited lower rates of oxygen consumption (P = 0.05) and an increased incidence of shivering thermogenesis. The perirenal adipose tissue of these lambs had a lower thermogenic activity (P < 0.01), less uncoupling protein (P < 0.01) and higher lipid content (P = 0.072) compared with intact controls.
   It is concluded that fetal thyroidectomy results in a decreased ability of newborn lambs to utilize nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue as well as increasing the incidence of hypothermia, These changes are associated with decreased synthesis of uncoupling protein and functional development of brown adipose tissue in the late gestation fetus.

AB Pentobarbital sleeping time was used as an in vivo pharmacological biomarker to determine the prenatal effects of LE-substituted amphetamines on hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes in 6-week old progeny of mice. Although the pentobarbital sleeping time was significantly shortened in both males and females exposed to 4-benzyloxyamphetamine (4-BEA), marked reductions in sleeping time were seen only in females prenatally exposed to 4-hydroxyamphetamine (4-HA) and 4-propoxyamphetamine (4-PPA); suggesting thereby a sex-related difference in the pentobarbital hypnosis after intrauterine exposure to 4-substituted amphetamines. Gender differences were also found in the gross liver weights and liver to body weight ratios of 6 week-old mice born from mothers dosed with 50 mg/kg/day of 4-substituted amphetamines on pregnancy days 6-18. The marked sleeping time reductions among female pups exposed to 4-HA, 4-PPA and 4-BEA were accompanied by a corresponding increase in liver to body weight ratio, suggesting that shortening of sleeping time could have resulted from the increased metabolic disposition of pentobarbital in these animals. No differences in sleeping time were found in the offspring of dams treated with 4-ethoxyamphetamine or 4-methoxyamphetamine. The sleeping time measurements indicate that 4-substituted amphetamines produce variable postnatal effects in mixed function hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes when the developing mouse fetuses are exposed to designer amphetamines.

AB Age-related changes in hepatic drug metabolizing activities of Lacaune ewes were determined in foetal, neonatal, growing, pregnant and adult animals. The ontogenic evolution of cytochrome P450 was compared to those of microsomal monooxygenases and some microsomal and cytosolic transferases. The involvement of two purified izoenzymes P4502B and P4503A was determined in the N-demethylation of various substrates and the hydroxylations of progesterone. An experimental fascioliasis, provoked by the oral administration of 150 metacercariae of Fasciola hepatica to sheep, was proposed as a pathological model. Its effect was measured on the pharmacokinetics of various hepatic tracers and veterinary drugs. The mean residence times of antipyrine, pentobarbital, albendazole and mebendazole were increased in infected lambs with consequences on the urinary excretion of 4-hydroxyantipyrine, prolongation of pentobarbital-induced sleeping time, elimination of albendazole sulfone and reduced mebendazole. The characteristic decrease in liver cytochrome P450 could be responsible for most of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes observed in fluke-infected ruminants.

ID SYSTEMS
AB During the last 6 years ABPM has become a widely used method in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertensive patients as well as in correlating the disease to prognosis. Up to January 1995, the international market offered 43 devices from 31 manufacturers. In Germany there are 18 devices available on the market from 10 different manufactures. Mainly, two different techniques are applied, ausculation and oscillometry, each having some advantages and disadvantages: The oscillometric technique may be preferable in patients with hyperkinetic circulation (e.g., pregnancy), with ausculatory gap and when surrounding noises are interfering, whereas the auscultatory technique, being the original method, has some advantages in patients with dysrhythmias and atrial fibrillation, as well as in dynamic (bicycle) exercise. The auscultatory method may be optimized by using EGG-, respectively oscillometric gating. The future development, which has already been realized in seven international recorders, offers the opportunity of either using auscultatory and/or oscillometric techniques during the same recording. To estimate the ''true'' sleeping interval more precisely a ''day-night-button'' at the recorder side is helpful. Furthermore, an uniform computer printout of the mean values of day- and night-time intervals, together with the widely approved limits of normotension should be achieved; last, but not least, an important factor for the widespread use of ABPM in general practice, as well as in the hospital, will be the prices of the recorders, which have been reduced to about DM 3000 - 6000 in Germany (January 1996).

AB This review, based on the Fourth International Consensus Conference on Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (Leuven, Belgium. 1994), deals with the technical aspects of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring by noninvasive intermittent techniques is widely used despite artifacts due to cuff size, movement, body position, short-term blood pressure variability, and interference with sleep. The performance of the currently available monitors under truly ambulatory conditions and during exercise remains a matter of debate, as are the procedures required to validate portable monitors under these circumstances. There is general agreement that whenever a monitor is to be used in special populations, such as older subject's or pregnant women, or in special conditions, such as exercise, a specific demonstration of its accuracy in these defined subgroups or conditions is warranted. Whether the auscultatory or oscillometric method is preferred remains controversial because each technique has specific advantages and disadvantages and because both can provide accurate results. Most experts in the field strongly believe that manufacturers should disclose the algorithms of their devices and that they should specify all changes made to the hardware and software of a previously validated monitor. Finally, the development of the volume-damp method, which makes continuous noninvasive registration of blood pressure at the finger possible in both stationary and ambulatory conditions, opens new perspectives in research, in particular in relation to short-term blood pressure variability.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a relationship between fetal behavior and maternal anxiety during pregnancy. The study population consisted of 18 uncomplicated human pregnancies at 38 to 40 weeks gestation. Maternal anxiety was assessed one time using Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. After an overnight fast, each mother was given a standard meal on arrival to the fetal testing unit. Each fetus was examined for 4 hours using heart rate monitoring and real-time sonography. Fetal behavioral states were assigned based on heart rate pattern and the presence or absence of eye and gross body movements. We found that, compared with fetuses of mothers with low trait anxiety scores, fetuses of mothers with relatively high trait anxiety scores spent significantly more time in quiet sleep and exhibited less gross body movement when in active sleep. The results of this pilot study raise the possibility that maternal anxiety during pregnancy may have a significant effect on fetal behavior.

Ahr phenotype was determined by the zoxazolamine sleeping time test after beta-naphthoflavone pretreatment at 6 weeks of age, The offspring were examined for rumours at 1 year, Both 3-methylcholanthrene and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene treatments resulted in a two- to five-fold greater incidence and multiplicity of lung and liver rumours in the Ah(+) offspring compared with that in Ah(-) littermates. By contrast, there was no difference between Ah(+) and Ah(-) offspring with regard to numbers of tumours caused by benzo[a]pyrene, Maternal Ahr phenotype appeared to play a role also, in that the offspring of the Ahr-responsive F-1 mothers developed fewer tumours per unit dose than those of the nonresponsive DBA/2 mothers. The effect of maternal phenotype on risk was three- to five-fold. Fetal and maternal phenotype combined yielded a 10- to 20-fold risk differential for transplacental carcinogenesis by the methylated compounds, with greatest risk experienced by responsive fetuses in nonresponsive mothers, and least by nonresponsive progeny of responsive mothers.

AB Acetylcholine has been implicated in brainstem mechanisms of cardiac and ventilatory control, arousal, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and cranial nerve motor activity. Virtually nothing is known about the developmental profiles of cholinergic perikarya, fibers, terminals, and/or receptors in the brainstems of human fetuses and infants. This study provides baseline information about the quantitative distribution of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in fetal and infant brainstems. Brainstem sections were analyzed from 6 fetuses (median age: 21.5 postconceptional weeks), 4 premature infants (median age: 26 postconceptional weeks), and 11 infants (median age: 53 postconceptional weeks). One child and three adult brainstems were examined as indices of maturity for comparison. The postmortem interval in all cases was less than or equal to 24 hours (median: 10 hours). Muscarinic receptors were localized by autoradiographic methods with the radiolabeled antagonist [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([H-3]QNB). Computer-based methods permitted quantitation of [H-3]QNB binding in specific nuclei and three-dimensional reconstructions of binding patterns.
   By midgestation, muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding is already present and regionally distributed, with the highest binding levels in the interpeduncular nucleus, inferior colliculus, griseum pontis, nucleus of the solitary tract, motor cranial nerve nuclei, and reticular formation. During the last half of gestation, [H-3]QNB binding decreases in most, but not all, of the nuclei sampled. The most substantial decline occurs in the reticular formation of the medulla and pens, a change that is not fully explained by progressive myelination and lipid quenching. Binding levels remain essentially constant in the inferior olive and griseum pontis. Around the time of birth or shortly thereafter, the relative distribution of binding becomes similar to that in the adult; with the highest levels in the interpeduncular nucleus and griseum pontis, although binding levels are higher overall in the infant. In the rostral pontine reticular formation, paramedian bands of high muscarinic binding are present which do not correspond to a cytoarchitectonically defined nucleus. By analogy to animal studies, these bands may comprise a major cholinoreceptive region of the human rostral pontine reticular formation involved in REM sleep. In the human interpeduncular nucleus in all age periods examined, muscarinic binding localizes to the lateral portions bilaterally, indicative of a heterogeneous chemoarchitecture. Muscarinic binding is high in the arcuate nucleus, a component of the putative respiratory chemosensitive fields along the ventral surface of the infant medulla. This observation is consistent with the known effects of muscarinic agents on chemosensitivity and ventilatory responses applied to the ventral medullary surface in animal models. The nonuniform distribution of muscarinic binding in the caudorostral plane in individual brainstem nuclei, as illustrated by three-dimensional reconstructions, underscores the need for rigorous sampling at precisely matched levels in quantitative studies. This study provides basic information toward understanding the neurochemical basis of brainstem disorders involving dysfunction of autonomic and ventilatory control, arousal, and REM sleep in preterm and full-term newborns and infants and for developing cholinergic drugs for such disorders in the pediatric population.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BINDING-PROTEIN; PREGNANCY
AB Objective To determine whether the circadian rhythm of circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) is evident at the time of delivery.
   Design Prospective observational study in six pregnant women and cross-sectional study in 65 women at the time of delivery.
   Subjects Six pregnant women sampled over a period of 24 hours, 23 women sampled at the time of elective caesarean section, and 42 women sampled at the time of vaginal delivery.
   Results In the women sampled serially over a 24 hour period there was an obvious circadian rhythm of IGFBP-1 with a peak between 01.00 and 09.00 hours. In the women sampled at the time of delivery there was no evidence for any relationship between the time of delivery and maternal or fetal levels of IGFBP-1.
   Conclusions The circadian rhythm of IGFBP-1 is not observed in women in labour. Therefore, the time of day is not an important confounding variable in studies on IGFBP-1 levels at the time of normal delivery.

AB The risks and causes of persistent crying in early infancy are discussed on the basis of a study of 61 infants referred to the Munich Interdisciplinary Research and Intervention Program for Pussy Babies for persistent crying between 1 and 6 months of age, and of a community sample of 51 infants of the same age. Particular attention was paid to pre-verbal parent-infant communication, the development of which was interpreted in terms of a dynamic interactional system including both regulatory and communicative predispositions in infants and intuitive competence for supporting infant predispositions in parents. Neither a gut problem nor any other single causal factor was identified for persistent crying in the majority of cases. In contrast, persistent crying was significantly associated with multiple biological and psychosocial risk factors for both parents and infants. Neurological immaturity, difficult temperament and sleep problems in infants, and impaired psychological conditions, limited resources and failures of intuitive competences in mothers were found to threaten the developmental process in infants and give rise to 'vicious circles' which were destabilizing the interactional systems. Increased attention to intuitive parental competences is recommended as one effective model for therapeutic interventions.

AB The metabolic and behavioral effects of 40-45% hemorrhage (at similar to 1%/min) were studied in nine fetal lamds in utero (130-135 days of gestation) until 2 days posthemorrhage. Umbilical blood flow (Q(um)) fell from 192 +/- 14 to 100 +/- 9 ml . min(-1) . kg(-1) at the end of blood loss, and on the day of hemorrhage it was linearly related to blood volume. However, on the posthemorrhage days, Q(um) was restored even though blood volume was still reduced. Fetal O-2 delivery (DO2) fell with the decrease in Q(um) and later due to anemia (decrease in hematocrit from 33.4 +/- 1.2 to 23.6 +/- 1.2%), from 946 +/- 81 to 494 +/- 47 mu mol . min(-1) . kg(-1), but the decrease was lessened because of a rise in umbilical venous PO2 (31.7 +/- 2.6 to 45.9 +/- 2.8 mmHg). Fetal O-2 consumption was reduced during and for 2 h after hemorrhage (262 +/- 17 to 190 +/- 16 mu mol . min(-1) . kg(-1)), and this was associated with modest lactic acidemia (1.25 +/- 0.11 to 2.91 +/- 0.43 mM). There was also a temporary reduction in fetal breathing activity, low voltage electrocortical state, and rapid eye movements, but this was not associated with hypoxemia. It is concluded that reductions in fetal DO2 achieved via fetal blood loss are better tolerated than during hypoxemia and that the associated depression in fetal biophysical activities involves mechanisms other than systemic hypoxia.

AB In Siberian hamsters, the rate of testicular maturation during juvenile life can be influenced by both the prenatal photoperiod and the day length experienced postnatally. In this report, potential postnatal photoperiodic mechanisms modified by prenatal photoperiod were investigated in this species. The study examined the effect of prenatal photoperiodic history on the postnatal pineal melatonin (MEL) rhythm and on postnatal secretion of FSH and PRL. In the first study, the pineal MEL content of hamsters, gestated in either 16 h of light and 8 h of darkness/day (16L) or 10L and raised postnatally in 14L, was monitored at various times of the day and night at 18 days of age. We found that prenatal photoperiod did influence the postnatal pineal MEL rhythm in 18-day-old males, but a similar effect was not evident in females. For males, the durations of the nocturnal elevation of pineal MEL were 8.5 and 7 h in 16L and 10L gestated hamsters, respectively. However, MEL rhythms were similar to each other in the corresponding groups of females (8.5- and 9-h durations of elevated pineal MEL in 16L and 10L prenatal photoperiod groups, respectively). In a subsequent study using the same photoperiod paradigm, FSH and PRL concentrations were examined in both genders at 3- to 10-day intervals between 18 - 62 days of age. The serum PRL (day 22) and FSH (days 18 and 22) concentrations in males were significantly affected by prenatal photoperiod. Specifically, circulating serum PRL (on day 22) and FSH (on days 18 and 22) concentrations were increased substantially in 10L gestated, compared to 16L gestated, males raised in 14L after birth. In contrast, serum FSH concentrations in female hamsters were not different between 16L and 10L gestated groups at these times. In another study using the same experimental design, the pattern of testicular development was explored in males. Hamsters that had experienced a 10L photoperiod prenatally and were raised in 14L exhibited rapid testicular growth from 27-52 days of age compared to hamsters that had experienced a 16L prenatal photoperiod and were reared in 14L. These results support the hypothesis that in juvenile male hamsters exposed to 14L postnatally, endogenous MEL production and serum FSH concentrations are influenced by photoperiodic information received during fetal life. In addition, these findings help to explain why males gestated in 10L and raised in 14L exhibit accelerated testicular development in the first 2 months of life compared to males gestated in 16L and transferred to 14L after birth. Finally, the data suggest that there is a gender difference with respect to the influence of prenatal photoperiods on the postnatal MEL rhythm-generating system that correlates with a gender difference in the effects of gestation photoperiod on serum FSH concentrations at 18-22 days of age.

AB This study examined behavioral and physiologic regulation in 14 full-term neonates who were exposed to cocaine antenatally. A group of 14 non-cocaine-exposed infants served as controls. Data on behavioral state, cardiac patterning (heart period and vagal tone), and habituation to a standardized stimulus were collected. There were no differences between cocaine-exposed and nonexposed infants in heart period or vagal tone during an undisturbed period. There were significant differences in behavioral state regulation: Cocaine-exposed infants displayed significantly greater state lability and shorter sleep bouts, fussed or cried more often, and spent less time asleep and more time in transitional states. Both groups responded to an auditory stimulus with shorter heart period, but cocaine-exposed neonates demonstrated a larger response. In addition, cocaine-exposed neonates displayed less behavioral response decrement to repeated presentations of the stimulus. Although there are limitations to attribution of these results to cocaine alone, the results are discussed in relation to prevailing clinical impressions of cocaine-exposed neonates.

AB Objective: To describe the relationship between antenatal and intrapartum factors and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
   Methodology: The New Zealand Cot Death Study was a 3 year case-control study, with 485 infants who died from SIDS in the postneonatal period and 1800 randomly selected control infants. Data were obtained from obstetric records, parental interview and community nursing records.
   Results: This study confirms many of the antenatal and intrapartum risk factors for SIDS noted in studies from both the southern and northern hemispheres. After controlling for potential confounders, such as occupational group and marital status, significant inverse effects were noted for interpregnancy interval, birthweight and gestation. Other factors that retained a significantly increased risk of SIDS were: increasing parity, bacteriological evidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) (adjusted odds ratio 1.73, 95% Cl 1.10-2.73); smoking antenatally (AdjOR 2.14, 95% Cl 1.61-2.84); less than six antenatal checks attended (AdjOR 1.84, 95% Cl 1.19-2.84); second stage of labour less than 16 min (AdjOR 2.06, 95% Cl 1.35-3.14) and multiple birth (AdjOR 3.23, 95% Cl 1.70-6.02). No interaction was observed between maternal haemoglobin and antenatal smoking. Interactions were tested for and not found between antenatal smoking and three antenatal risk factors (UTI, short second stage of labour and number of antenatal appointments). The only significant interaction between these three factors and three modifiable postnatal risk factors (prone sleeping, bed sharing and bottle feeding) was between bed sharing and fewer antenatal appointments. The risk of SIDS associated with bed sharing was greater among those whose mothers had fewer antenatal appointments.
   Conclusions: Although many of the previously identified antenatal and intrapartum risk factors for SIDS are confirmed, the risks of SIDS associated with obstetric factors are in general considerably lower than the risks associated with the four modifiable postnatal risk factors.

AB 1. Studies were carried out in unanaesthetized fetal sheep at 125-135 days gestation to investigate neurotransmitters involved in behavioural state.
   2. Catheters and electrodes were chronically placed to record tracheal and arterial pressure, electrocortical activity (ECoG), nuchal muscle activity and to instill drugs into the cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) of the fourth ventricle.
   3. Administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists DL-2-amino-5-phospho-pentanoic acid (AP5) or (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzol[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10- iminemoleate (MK-801) increased the incidence of fetal behaviour characterized by low voltage ECoG, nuchal muscle activity and an increase in mean arterial blood pressure from 4.1 +/- 6 to 60.6 +/- 6.2% (mean +/- S.E.M.) (AP5; P = 0.003) and from 7.6 +/- 3.6 to 50.8 +/- 7.0% (MK-801; P = 0.004; values are expressed as the percentage of each 60 min period in which the state was present).
   4. The incidence of fetal breathing during periods of lon voltage (LV)-ECoG and nuchal muscle activity was 83.1 +/- 5.6%. The incidence of fetal breathing during LV-ECoG associated with nuchal muscle atonia was 63.1 +/- 5.0% before AP5 or MK-801 and 64.4 +/- 9.8% after instillation of these drugs. The amplitude of fetal breaths increased from 4.0 +/- 0.3 mmHg in low voltage ECoG periods to 6.7 +/- 0.8 mmHg (P = 0.006) during periods of low voltage with nuchal muscle activity. There was no significant change in breath timing during these periods.
   5. Instillation of an inhibitor of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) re-uptake 1,2-diphenylmethylene-amino-oxyethyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-3- -pyridine carboxylic acid hydrochloride (NNC711) into the fourth ventricle prior to administering AP5 either eliminated behaviour characterized by low voltage ECoG and nuchal muscle activity, or prolonged the time until it first occurred.
   6. These observations suggest that fetal behaviour characterized by low voltage ECoG, nuchal muscle activity and increased mean arterial pressure is suppressed in the sheep fetus by a GABAergic mechanism and that the interneurones involved require stimulation at NMDA receptors to maintain their GABA output. This behavioural state increases breath amplitude in the fetus.

AB Secondary aldosteronism occurs in states of low effective arterial blood volume, which activates the renin-angiosterone concentration and stimulates the distal reabsorption of sodium by the kidney to restore blood volume. This article discusses the effects of secondary aldosteronism on sodium and potassium in the body. Normal aldosterone function is reviewed, followed by a focus on ischemic hypertensive conditions, including renovascular hypertension, malignant hypertension, renin-producing tumors, pregnancy, chronic renal failure, and iatrogenic secondary hyperaldosteronism.

AB Wistar rats were exposed to dichlorvos [CAS number 62737]. Doses were 1/25; 1/50; 1/75; and 1/100 LD(50) that is 3.88; 1.94; 1.46; and 0.97 mg kg(-1) DDVP, respectively, throughout gestation (GD1-birth) and during suckling via oral dosing to the dams, and then via the same doses by gavage for the rest of their lives. The offspring were tested in an open field (OF), a multiple T-maze, and in a 'novelty-induced-grooming' test to assess behavioural competence as adults. Dose-related increases in running time and incorrect choices in the maze were observed during the first 2 weeks of a 3-week study at 9-11 weeks of age. Horizontal activity was increased, vertical activity decreased, and defecation decreased in the OF at 9-12 weeks of age; these changes were again dose-related. Sleep was also affected at 12 weeks of age. AChE activity in the brain and in blood at sacrifice was roughly 40% to 65% of control, again reflecting the doses administered. The significantly changed behavioural profile of DDVP treated rats may serve as a useful biomarker to judge functional damage of CNS properties.

ID BODY CONTOUR SURGERY; SUCTION LIPECTOMY; COMPLICATIONS; LIFT
AB Modern abdominoplasty techniques were developed in the 1960s. The advent of liposuction has reduced the need for classic abdominoplasty and allowed more aesthetic sculpting of the entire trunk. However, the combination of significant truncal liposuction and classic abdominoplasty is not recommended due to the increased risk of complications. Although the surgical principles of classic abdominoplasty certainly have stood the test of time, they are based on two theoretical assumptions that may be proved to be inaccurate. The first assumption is that nide direct undermining to costal margins is essential for abdominal flap advancement. In fact, discontinuous undermining allows effective loosening of the abdominal nap while preserving vascular perforators. The second inaccurate assumption is that with aging and weight fluctuations (including pregnancy), abdominal skin relaxation occurs primarily in the vertical direction from the xiphoid to the pubis. This is true in the lower abdomen, burin most patients a strong superficial fascial system adherence to the linea alba in the epigastrium limits vertical descent. Epigastric laxity frequently results from a progressive horizontal loosening due to relaxation of the tissues along the lateral trunk. Experience with the lower-body lift procedure has shown that significant lateral truncal skin resection results in epigastric tightening. In these patients, the ideal abdominoplasty pattern would resect as much or more laterally than centrally, leading to more natural abdominal contours. Fifty patients who underwent high-lateral-tension abdominoplasty with and without significant truncal liposuction and other aesthetic procedures were followed for 4 to 16 months. The primary indication for surgery was moderate to severe laxity of abdominal skin and muscle with or without truncal fat deposits. Complication rates were equal to or less than those of historical controls and did not increase with significant adjunctive liposuction. The key technical elements of this procedure include direct undermining limited to the paramedian area, discontinuous undermining to costal margins and flanks as needed, skin resection pattern with significant lateral resection and highest-tension wound closure placed laterally, superficial fascial system repair with permanent sutures along the entire incision, and liberal use of adjunctive liposuction in the upper abdomen and the lateral and posterior trunk.

AB There is considerable evidence that the childbearing years represent a time when women are highly vulnerable to developing mood disorders. Prospective, cross-sectional, and retrospective studies have demonstrated that more than 10% of new adult mothers will experience a major depressive episode during the first postpartum year. Changes in the health care delivery system will result in increased pressure on the obstetrician/gynecologist to identify and treat women with postpartum-onset depression. Despite shortcomings in the available literature, prospective studies have identified risk factors for developing postpartum depression. Furthermore, the clear overlap between the normal sequelae of childbirth and the symptoms of major depression, including alterations in sleep, energy, libido, appetite, and body weight, underscores the need to develop guidelines for early identification. We furnish a brief overview of postpartum mood disorders with a primary focus on the antenatal and postnatal risk factors for developing postpartum depression. Based on the extant literature and our clinical experience, a set of recommendations for early identification and treatment is provided.

ID OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA
AB Nocturnal nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is increasingly used to treat chronic respiratory failure in a wide variety of conditions (myopathies, Ondine's curse, kyphoscoliosis, etc.) and allows a normal everyday life. Some of these diseases affect women of childbearing age.
   We report on a young woman suffering from primary alveolar hypoventilation, who presented with limitation of daytime activities, severe oxygen desaturation during sleep, polycythaemia and pulmonary hypertension. These abnormalities completely reversed after a few months of NIPPV applied through a nasal mask. Whilst under ventilatory assistance during sleep, she had an uneventful pregnancy and delivery of a normal baby.
   We suggest that in selected patients requiring NIPPV, pregnancy can be contemplated with a reasonable level of safety both for the mother and the child, provided that adequate mechanical ventilatory assistance during sleep is maintained throughout pregnancy.

AB This study assessed effects of prolonged prenatal cocaine exposure on respiratory pattern and sleep-wake states in a postnatal porcine model. Yucatan miniature sows received 2 mg/kg cocaine intravenously four times daily during 0.66-1.0 gestation. At birth, cocaine-exposed litters were fostered to unexposed paired sows and their litters. Chronically instrumented piglets were studied at 3-9 (young) and 21-31 days (older). Sleep-wake states were determined from electrocorticogram, eye movements, submental electromyogram, and behavior, and respiratory patterns were determined from diaphragmatic and posterior cricoarytenoid electromyograms (EMGdi and EMGpca, respectively). Under baseline conditions, prenatal cocaine 1) increased the number of apneas expressed by silence of EMGdi or EMGpca and prolonged the duration of EMGpca-related apneas at both ages; 2) increased the number of periodic breathing episodes at both ages; 3) increased percent time of active sleep and decreased that of wakefulness at both ages; and 4) increased time in quiet sleep in the older animals, producing in them a sleep-wake distribution similar to that of the young neonates. Whereas the findings in the youngest piglets may have been influenced by persistent systemic cocaine, those in the older preexposed piglets, devoid of systemic cocaine, imply that chronic prenatal cocaine retards the postnatal maturation of state and respiratory pattern.

DE PREECLAMPSIA; 24 H AMBULATORY BP MONITORING
AB The aim of our study was to evaluate by means of ambulatory 24 h monitoring the diurnal systolic (SEP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure profiles in a group (n = 18) of gravid patients with pre-eclampsia compared with a group (n = 17) of healthy control subjects matched for age and week of gestation to assess whether: (i) ambulatory BP is also raised in pre-eclampsia; (ii) the increase of BP, if present, occurs to the same extent during both daytime and night; and (iii) a blunted BP pattern is consistently present in preeclampsia. BP was recorded at intervals of 15 min for 25 h using a TM2420 non-invasive pressurometer. The presence of a circadian rhythm of BP was assessed by cosinor analysis. SEP was higher in women with pre-eclampsia (24 h average 115 +/- 11 vs. 136 +/- 12, P = 6 x 10(-6). daytime 117 +/- 12 vs. 139 +/- 13, P = 6 x 10(-6); night 110 +/- 11 vs. 129 +/- 14, P = 5 x 10(-5)) as well as DBP (24 h average 67 +/- 5 vs. 86 +/- 6, P = 8 x 10(-12). daytime 69 +/- 6 vs. 89 +/- 5, P = 2 x 10(-11) night 62 +/- 4 vs. 80 +/- 8, P = 5 x 10-(10)). DBP percentage reduction from day to night did not differ between the control subjects and the women with pre-eclampsia (9.6 +/- 6.5 vs. 9.8 +/- 4.6, P = 0.96), whereas SEP percentage reduction was greater in the latter group (5.4 +/- 4.6 vs. 8.1 +/- 5.5, P = 0.13). Cosinor analysis demonstrated the presence of a significant circadian rhythm of BP (P < 0.0001) in both the control and pre-eclampsia groups. In conclusion, the results of our study show that ambulatory SEP and DBP are raised in pre-eclampsia and that a blunting of the diurnal BP pattern is not present in most women with the disease.

AB Neonates, as compared to older subjects, exhibit increased signs of relative respiratory suppression such as apnea, periodic breathing and only transient hyperventilatory response to hypoxia. Prenatal cocaine exposure exaggerates the respiratory pattern disturbances observed in infants. As endogenous opioids cause central suppression of breathing, we tested their possible involvement in these effects by assessing opioid content in respiratory-related brainstem regions of 2 to 5 (young) and 18 to 22 (older) day-old piglets, unexposed or preexposed to cocaine during 0.66 to 1.0 gestation. The selected ages represent distinct stages in the postnatal development of respiration. beta-Endorphin, methionine-enkephalin, dynorphin A and dynorphin B from the tractus solitarii, ambigualis, gigantoreticularis and parabrachialis medialis nuclei were separated by high performance liquid chromatography, then quantified by radioimmunoassays. Opioid content was higher in the brain regions of the young than of the older piglets, and increased after cocaine exposure in both age groups, but more in the young. These findings support the possible contribution of high opioid content to the relative suppression of respiratory function in early life, and to the exaggerated respiratory dysrhythmia observed in cocaine preexposed neonates.

AB The effects of adenosine on atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion were determined in chronically catheterized fetal sheep (> 0.8 term). Adenosine was infused into the the right jugular vein for 1 h at 8 +/- 0.4 (5 fetuses), 160 +/- 8 (6 fetuses), and 344 +/- 18 mu g . min(-1). kg estimated fetal wt(-1). Fetal arterial blood gases and pH were generally unaffected by adenosine, although mean arterial CO2 tension increased transiently by 2-5 Torr and pH fell progressively during the highest rate of infusion. During the intermediate and high infusion rates, fetal hemoglobin concentrations increased by 11-13% and mean fetal heart rate rose by 18% from a control value of similar to 167 beats/min. Mean arterial pressure was not affected during adenosine infusion. Adenosine significantly increased fetal plasma ANP levels, with maximum concentrations 1.80, 2.36, and 2.51 times greater than control means (142-166 pg/ml) for the respective infusion rates of 8, 160, and 344 mu g . min(-1). kg estimated fetal wt(-1). In seven fetuses, reducing fetal arterial O-2 tension by similar to 9-10 Torr from a control of 23 +/- 1.3 Torr increased plasma ANP concentrations similar to 2.4 times the control mean of 176 pg/min. Adenosine-receptor blockade with 8-(p-sulfophenyl)-theophylline reduced by 50% the maximum hypoxia-induced rise in plasma ANP concentrations. It is concluded that adenosine causes a dose-dependent rise in fetal plasma ANP concentrations and modulates fetal ANP release during hypoxia.

AB Serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration circadian rhythm is abolished in many endocrine and nonendocrine diseases. In the present study we have measured serum TSH concentration over 24 h every 2 h in second and third trimester pregnant women. During the 24-h period, serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine concentrations did not change significantly. In contrast, serum TSH concentrations demonstrated significant circadian variations both in the second and third trimester pregnant women (p < 0.02 and p < 0.005, respectively). In summary, second and third trimester pregnancy is associated with a normal circadian TSH rhythm.

AB To establish normal values for flash visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in the preterm period, we analyzed 356 records from 63 neurologically normal infants (26-35 weeks gestation) followed longitudinally. Using both sleep and drowsy state recording within the same session and a mean of 5.7 weekly recording sessions per infant, we hypothesized that the prominent negative wave (N1) consisted of 2 negative components, N1a (early) and N1b (late). This hypothesis could explain the previously reported variability in VEP indices.
   With a precise definition of the N1a peak, we were able to establish reference ranges for N1a peak latencies at various postmenstrual ages (PMA) which, unlike those previously reported, are narrow enough to be clinically useful. From a cross-sectional analysis we found that the N1a peak latency decreased with maturation at about 4.6 msec/week between 30 and 40 weeks PMA (P < 0.001).
   We also analyzed the N1 wave form and demonstrated its developmental maturation during this period. There were significant decreases in the amplitudes of both the N1a and N1b peaks with maturation (P < 0.001), but the decrease of the N1a amplitude was steeper than that of N1b. The N1 wave form changed from a wave in which the early peak (N1a) was higher than the late peak (N1b) into the reverse with N1b higher than N1a. This wave change may be related to developmental processes in the visual system. Longitudinal follow-up revealed that extra-uterine life may accelerate the maturation of the N1 wave form but has no effect on the decrease of the absolute values of peak latencies.

AB The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of prenatal cocaine exposure on infant sleep and wakefulness. Four-hour recordings of sleep and wakefulness were obtained from 17 cocaine-exposed neonates and 14 control infants at 2 weeks of age. Each 1-min epoch was classified as quiet sleep, active sleep, indeterminate sleep, or waking based on eye and body movements and respiratory variability. Analyses of variance were performed on durations of total sleep versus wakefulness, and quiet sleep, active sleep, and indeterminate sleep. The cocaine-exposed infants showed proportions of sleep and wake time similar to those of the control infants. Sleep time was, however, distributed differently among the various sleep states in the cocaine-exposed infants. Infants with prenatal cocaine exposure showed significantly more indeterminate sleep and significantly less active sleep than the control infants, even when confounding variables were controlled statistically. Regression analyses indicated that infrequent cocaine use paradoxically increased indeterminate sleep time to a greater extent than frequent use, possibly due to differences in patterns of cocaine use or recency of exposure. These results suggest that active sleep is less organized at 2 weeks of age in infants of cocaine-abusing mothers than in infants without cocaine exposure.

SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN HYPERTENSION

DT Article
DE BLOOD PRESSURE; CIRCADIAN RHYTHM; PREGNANCY
AB The objective of the study was to describe the 24h blood pressure (BP) pattern in pregnant women with a reversed circadian BP rhythm. The 24h BP monitorings (24BPM) were performed in 73 pregnant women hospitalised for hypertension. Daytime (6.00 am to 10.00 pm) and night-time (10.00 pm to 6.00 am) BP variables were calculated. A reversed circadian BP rhythm was defined as a day/night mean BP ratio < 1.0.
   Fourteen women had a reversed circadian BP rhythm. Their diurnal mean BP was equal to women with a normal rhythm, but their nocturnal mean BP was significantly higher and their BP oscillation amplitudes tended to be lower. The day/night mean SBP and DBP ratios correlated significantly, with the DBP ratios slightly higher than corresponding SBP ratios. At repeated 24BPM (n = 14), the day/night ratio did not change but a reversed rhythm occurred during anti-hypertensive medication in one case, and a reversed rhythm switched spontaneously to normal in one case.
   The diurnal BP pattern did not differ between women with a reversed and a normal circadian BP rhythm. Women with a reversed rhythm had a higher nocturnal BP, but this was part of the definition. The BP variations were generally smaller in the group with a reversed rhythm, although the variations were still large. The definition with a day/night ratio cut-off at 1.0 was rather a convenient mathematical choice than a biologically-determined limit. The day/night BP ratio remained unchanged at repeated measurements, but a reversed rhythm was not a constant phenomenon in occasional cases. Women with a reversed circadian BP rhythm were therefore not a well-defined group and, with exception for a tendency to smaller BP fluctuations, no specific behavioural BP pattern could be described. Until the normal circadian BP rhythm in normal pregnancy has been described, there is no possibility to identify women with an abnormal circadian BP rhythm. Ideally, any definition of an abnormal rhythm should be related to the clinical relevance.

AB Background - Mothers of twins have some difficulties to individualize their child-raising activities during the first year. This study was aimed to determine factors influencing such activities.
   Population and methods. - Thirty-seven pairs of twins born after 36 weeks of gestation and weighing more than 2,000 g were included in the study. Relationships between the parents and their children were studied from questionnaires concerning activities during the first trimester and the end of the first year of age. Each item concerning organization of meals and sleeping was graded 1 to 3 according to the degree of individualization of the care. Items concerning support of the mother by the father or other people were graded 1 to 3 according to the degree of this assistance. The physical and psychological status of the mother was also graded according to the presence or not of asthenia and/or depression. Home activities of the mother were also observed.
   Results. - The state of the mother during the first few months had an impact on her mothering behavior: tired or depressed mothers tend to treat the twins collectively and simultaneously. No link was found between social, paternal or general familial support and the degree of individualization in the maternal behaviors.
   Conclusions. - Several factors can interfere with the psychological repercussions of a twin birth on the mother and subsequent psychoemotional development of children. Further studies are necessary to understand how each parent contributes to the organization of the family system.

AB Objective-To investigate, in a population based national study, the association between sleeping position of infants and the occurrence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
   Design-A retrospective survey and registry based ecological study. A questionnaire based surveillance of sleeping position was obtained in a random sample (n=34 799) and surveillance of SIDS was based on all infants born in Norway 1967-91, surviving the perinatal period. Variables studied from the questionnaire were usual sleeping position (placed), breast feeding at 3 months, and maternal smoking in pregnancy, and from the Medical Birth Registry maternal age, birth order, and birth weight.
   Results-Proportion of infants sleeping prone increased from 1970 (7.4%) to 1989 (49.1%) and dropped in 1990 (26.8%) and 1991 (28.3%). Occurrence of SIDS increased from 1970 (1.1/1000) to 1989 (2.0) before dropping in 1990 and 1991 (1.1).
   Implication and relevance of results-A cause effect relationship between prone sleeping and SIDS as suggested in previous studies is supported by the present, and so far only, national study of infants' sleeping position.

DT Note
ID CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; CORTISOL; METYRAPONE; SECRETION
AB The diagnosis of Cushing's Disease during pregnancy is complex because the biochemical features are obscured by changes in the normal hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis that occur during gestation. To date, treatment has not been successful and there is a high incidence of maternal and fetal complications, We report the case of a 24-year-old woman with Cushing's disease who presented during her 16th week of pregnancy. Diagnosis was confirmed by the finding of elevated serum and urinary free cortisol levels with loss of the normal circadian rhythm of serum cortisol. Cortisol levels failed to suppress after a low-dose dexamethasone test but suppressed after a high-dose test. There was an exaggerated serum cortisol and plasma adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) response to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH). Magnetic resonance (MR) scanning demonstrated a pituitary tumour and cure was effected by transsphenoidal surgery where tumour immunostaining for ACTH was removed. Postoperatively the patient made an uncomplicated recovery; serum cortisol and plasma ACTH levels were undetectable at 9 days following surgery and recovery of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis occurred at 99 days after surgery. Caesarean section was performed at 38 weeks of pregnancy and a healthy but small female infant was delivered, This case illustrates the biochemical features of Cushing's disease during pregnancy and is the first report of the use of CRH testing and MR scanning in this clinical situation. The cure by surgery and successful outcome for mother and infant, with preservation of normal anterior pituitary function, suggest that transsphenoidal surgery may be the treatment of choice.

AB Babies born after in vitro fertilisation (IVF) are increasing in number, and, although these babies are considered as very precious, no data are available regarding their risk for sudden infant death or apnoea. To evaluate the respiratory maturity of IVF babies, we evaluated the incidence of apnoea during an 8-h polysomnography in 50 consecutively presented IVF babies and in a group of 50 unselected naturally conceived babies. All infants were in good health and matched for term (born > 38 weeks of gestation), birth weight, sex and age at the time of investigation (6-11 weeks post term, median 8.0). There were 24 twins in the IVF and 6 twins in the control group. The incidence of obstructive and isolated central apnoea was comparable in the IVF and control group. However, NF babies had significantly more periodic breathing episodes than control babies (median 2.30 (range 0-15.30) in IVE and 1.02 (range 0-11.2) in control babies; P < 0.01). This difference was not related to the higher number of twins in the IVF group. Single IVF babies had significantly more short central apnoeas (5-10s) than IVF twins (5-10s) (mean 38.80 +/- 18.63 and 22.33 +/- 13.35; P < 0.001). This difference between single and twin babies was not found in the control group.
   Conclusion IVF babies have more periodic breathing episodes indicating an immature respiratory pattern than normally conceived babies.

AB Objective: To determine which risk factors are specific for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rather than characteristic of postneonatal deaths in general.
   Study population: The live births and infant death cohorts of the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey.
   Methods: Information on live births, deaths from SIDS, and postneonatal deaths from other causes was abstracted from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. To account for oversampling of certain populations, the data were weighted to reflect national counts. Risk factors were defined as black race, birth weight less than 1500 gm, birth weight less than 2500 gm, gestational age at birth less than 37 weeks, 5-minute Apgar score less than 7, male gender, more than two previous pregnancies, maternal age less than 20 years, maternal education level less than 12 years, multiple births, and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cls) were calculated to compare the SIDS with the live births cohort, infants who died of other causes with the live births cohort, and SIDS with non-SIDS deaths. The population-attributable risk percentage was computed for risk factors independently associated with SIDS when compared with other postneonatal deaths.
   Results: For all characteristics other than a 5-minute Apgar score less than 7, the ORs comparing infants who died of SIDS with the live births cohort were significantly greater than 1.0. Similarly, ORs comparing infants who died of other causes with the live births cohort were also greater than 1.0, except for male gender. When the two infant death cohorts were compared, only maternal smoking during pregnancy and low maternal education level were significantly more common among the SIDS group. After we controlled for cigarette smoking, the adjusted OR for low maternal education level was not significantly greater than 1.0. However, even after control for low maternal education level, prenatal exposure to tobacco was significantly more common among the SIDS group than in infants dying of other causes (OR = 1.97; 95% CI, 1.59 to 2.45). On the basis of an adjusted OR of 2.92 when the SIDS group was compared with the live births cohort, the population-attributable risk percentage for maternal smoking as a risk factor for SIDS was 30%.
   Conclusion: Among characteristics generally thought to be risk factors, only maternal smoking during pregnancy was independently associated with SIDS. Data from this nationally representative sample indicate that if women refrained from smoking while pregnant, up to 30% of SIDS might be prevented.

AB Objective. To determine whether there is a demonstrable abnormality in control of breathing in infants of substance-abusing mothers during the first few days of life.
   Methods. We enrolled 12 drug-free control infants and 12 infants of substance abusing mothers (ISAMs). These infants experienced otherwise uncomplicated term pregnancies and deliveries. The infants were assigned to a group based on the results of maternal histories and maternal and infant urine toxicology screens. Studies were performed during quiet sleep during the first few days of life. We measured heart rate, oxygen saturations via a pulse oximeter, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ET-CO2) level, respiratory rate, tidal volume, and airflow. The chemoreceptor response was assessed by measuring minute ventilation and the ET-CO2 level after 5 minutes of breathing either room air or 4% carbon dioxide.
   Results. The gestational ages by obstetrical dating and examination of the infants were not different, although birth weights and birth lengths were lower in the group of ISAMs. Other demographic data were not different, and there were no differences in the infants' median ages at the time of study or in maternal use of tobacco and alcohol. The two groups had comparable baseline (room air) ET-CO2 levels, respiratory rates, tidal volumes, and minute ventilation. When compared with the group of ISAMs, the drug-free group had markedly increased tidal volume and minute ventilation on exposure to 4% carbon dioxide. These increases accounted for the difference in sensitivity to carbon dioxide, calculated as the change in minute ventilation per unit change in ET-CO2 (milliliters per kg/min per mm Hg). The sensitivity to carbon dioxide of control infants was 48.66 +/- 7.14 (mean +/- SE), whereas that of ISAMs was 16.28 +/- 3.14,
   Conclusions. These data suggest that ISAMs are relatively insensitive to challenge by carbon dioxide during the first few days of life. We speculate that this reflects an impairment of the chemoreceptor response.

TI SEASONAL-VARIATION IN HUMAN-REPRODUCTION - ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS

LA English
DT Review
ID POST-PARTUM AMENORRHEA; MALE RHESUS-MONKEYS; WHITE-TAILED DEER; PLASMA
   MELATONIN; BIRTH SEASONALITY; UNITED-STATES; ANNUAL RHYTHM; LACTATIONAL
   AMENORRHEA; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHM; MENSTRUAL CYCLES
AB Almost all human populations exhibit seasonal variation in births, owing mostly to seasonal variation in the frequency of conception. This review focuses on the degree to which environmental factors like nutrition, temperature and photoperiod contribute to these seasonal patterns by acting directly on the reproductive axis.
   The reproductive strategy of humans is basically that of the apes: Humans have the capacity to reproduce continuously, albeit slowly, unless inhibited by environmental influences. Two, and perhaps three, environmental factors probably act routinely as seasonal inhibitors in some human populations.
   First, it seems likely that ovulation is regulated seasonally in populations experiencing seasonal variation in food availability. More specifically, it seems likely that inadequate food intake or the increased energy expenditure required to obtain food, or both, can delay menarche, suppress the frequency of ovulation in the nonlactating adult, and prolong lactational amenorrhea in these populations on a seasonal basis. This action is mast easily seen in tropical subsistence societies where food availability often varies greatly owing to seasonal variation in rainfall; hence births in these populations often correlate with rainfall.
   Second, it seems likely that seasonally high temperatures suppress spermatogenesis enough to influence the incidence of fertilization in hotter latitudes, but possibly only in males wearing clothing that diminishes scrotal cooling. Since most of our knowledge about this phenomenon comes from temperate latitudes, the sensitivity of spermatogenesis in both human and nonhuman primates to heat in the tropics needs further study. It is quite possible that high temperatures suppress ovulation and early embryo survival seasonally in some of these same populations. Since we know less than desired about the effect of heat stress on ovulation and early pregnancy in nonhuman mammals, and nothing at all about it in humans or any of the other primates, this is an important area for future research.
   Third, correlational data suggest that there may be some degree of regulation of reproduction by photoperiod in humans at middle to higher latitudes. Populations at these latitudes often show a peak in presumed conceptions associated with the vernal equinox. On the other hand, evidence gathered by neuroendocrinologists tends to argue against reproductive photoresponsiveness in humans.

AB To examine whether differences in sleep maturation could be identified before birth, behavioural studies were carried out in 28 fetuses. Studies were possible in all 28 fetuses at 28 weeks, but only in 26 fetuses at 36 weeks (two fetuses delivered before 36 weeks). The risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) was determined using the Oxford SIDS scoring system. The fetuses at greater risk of SIDS had coincidence of behavioural characteristics for a significantly lower percentage of the time than those at low risk. This difference reached significance (p less than or equal to 0.05) only at 36 weeks.

AB This study investigated whether the temporal stress of working at night interferes with nurses' experience of different phases of the menstrual cycle. Twenty-four, rotating-shift nurses recorded data on a hand-held computer at the start and end of each day and every 2 hours during their shifts for a period of 28 days. The measures included a sleep diary, self-ratings of mood and symptoms, and two cognitive performance tasks. Using a pooled time series analysis, it was found that some of the self-report measures showed a significant interaction between type of shift worked and menstrual cycle phase. For example, alertness was found to be lower towards the end of the night shift during the premenstrual phase compared to other phase and shift combinations. However, some of the measures showed only main effects of cycle phase or were nonsignificant. Retrospective measures from a larger sample showed an association between the number of nights worked per year and duration of premenstrual and menstrual problems, and severity of premenstrual problems. The results suggest that nightwork may alter some aspects of nurses' psychological experience of the menstrual cycle.

AB OBJECTIVE: Studies on the effects of cocaine in fetal animals have been limited to acute exposures to the drug. We hypothesized that a prolonged infusion of cocaine to the fetal sheep would initially interrupt normal behavioral state cycling but the effects would be short lived as the fetus gained tolerance to the drug.
   STUDY DESIGN: The study was performed in a university laboratory on six time-dated pregnant ewes at 125 days' gestation. Fetal sheep, surgically instrumented 3 days before study, were given cocaine hydrochloride 0.6 mg/min for 6 hours. Fetal behavioral state before, during, and after the infusion was compared by repeated-measures analysis of variance.
   RESULTS: Infusion of cocaine caused a drop in the percentage time that the fetuses spent in both rapid-eye-movement (p < 0.03) and non-rapid-eye-movement (p < 0.001) sleep, which was sustained throughout the 6-hour infusion. This was related to a decrease in the number of rapid-eye-movement and non-rapid-eye-movement episodes as opposed to a decrease in the lengths of these behavioral states. With cessation of cocaine infusion, the fetal sheep showed an increase in rapid-eye-movement sleep, with a higher percentage than during control periods (p < 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine disrupts fetal rapid-eye-movement sleep without evidence for tolerance to the drug over a 6-hour period. ''Catch-up'' rapid-eye-movement sleep occurs with cessation of cocaine infusion. Neurobehavioral abnormalities associated with in utero cocaine exposure may be caused by chronic disruption of rapid-eye-movement sleep.

AB Little is known about the influence of sleep on systemic and uteroplacental hemodynamics during pregnancy. Experiments were therefore carried out on six chronically instrumented pregnant ewes (125-133 days of gestation) to investigate the influence of sleep on systemic and uteroplacental hemodynamics. Because nonlabor myometrial activity influences uteroplacental hemodynamics, we made measurements during quiet wakefulness, quiet sleep, and active sleep in the presence and absence of myometrial activity. Cardiac output, heart rate, and systemic arterial pressure were decreased in active sleep compared with quiet wakefulness; these variables were not significantly altered by myometrial activity. The interaction between sleep and myometrial activity was such that the lowest values of uteroplacental blood Row, as estimated from middle uterine artery blood flow to the pregnant uterine horn and, hence, uteroplacental oxygen delivery occurred during active sleep in the presence of myometrial activity (i.e., decreased similar to 19% compared with quiet wakefulness and the absence of myometrial activity). Further investigation is required to determine the possible fetal consequences of a reduced uteroplacental perfusion in the presence of myometrial activity during sleep.

AB Prior studies have found an increased incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes of pregnancies in asthmatic mothers, but these studies have been poorly controlled for asthma therapy and other confounding factors. The purpose of this study was to assess perinatal outcomes in actively managed pregnant asthmatic women as compared with matched nonasthmatic controls. Using an inception cohort design, we studied a volunteer sample of 486 pregnant (< 28 wk) women with documented asthma and 486 pregnant nonasthmatic controls with normal pulmonary function. Cases and controls were matched for age, smoking status, parity, and year of delivery. Asthma was managed with step therapy to prevent acute asthmatic episodes and asthma symptoms that interfered with sleep or normal activity. Chronic hypertension was significantly more common (p = 0.007) in asthmatic subjects (3.7%) than in matched controls (1.0%). However, no significant differences in incidences of preeclampsia, perinatal mortality, preterm births, low-birth-weight infants, intrauterine growth retardation, or congenital malformations were observed in the pregnancies of the asthmatic women as compared with the matched controls. Trends were observed toward relationships between more severe asthma requiring emergency therapy or corticosteroids and increased incidences of preeclampsia and low-birth-weight infants, but these associations were not statistically significant. These data suggest that the overall perinatal prognosis for women with actively managed asthma during pregnancy is comparable to that for the nonasthmatic population.

AB Fetal breathing movements are vital for normal fetal lung growth. Inhibition of these fetal breathing movements is associated with pulmonary hypoplasia. Pulmonary hypoplasia also occurs subsequent to alterations in other factors, such as a significant decrease in pulmonary blood flow. The prostaglandin system is known to have profound effects on both fetal breathing movements and on the pulmonary vascular system. We studied six late-gestation chronically instrumented fetal sheep by using an electromagnetic flow transducer around the left pulmonary artery to determine whether a decrease in fetal breathing movements, subsequent to a continuous infusion of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), is associated with a decrease in pulmonary blood flow. A continuous PGE(2) infusion of 0.88 +/- 0.11 mu g.kg(-1).min(-1) over 120 min led to a significant decrease in fetal breathing movements (control 40.5 +/- 3.6%, infusion 3.3 +/- 1.6%; P < 0.001). In contrast, the PGE(2) infusion had no effect on mean left pulmonary artery blood flow (control 27.7 +/- 9.3 ml.min(-1).kg(-1), infusion 23.8 +/- 7.0 ml.min(-1).kg(-1). The PGE(2) infusion demonstrated central effects in the percentage of time the fetus was in high-voltage electrocortical activity (control 41.9 +/- 2.5%, infusion 56.5 +/- 5.4%; P < 0.05) and in the amount of time spent in low-voltage electrocortical activity without fetal breathing movements (control 17.5 +/- 2.7%, infusion 40.2 +/- 4.8%; P < 0.05). A significant decrease in the fetal heart rate during the infusion was seen with no effect on either the systemic or pulmonary blood pressure. Thus it appears unlikely that the changes seen in lung growth subsequent to an absence of fetal breathing movements are mediated via changes in pulmonary blood flow.

AB Objective.-To examine the relationship between sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and smoking during pregnancy; postnatal tobacco smoke exposure from the mother, father, live-in adults, and day care providers; and postnatal smoke exposure from breast-feeding.
   Design.-Case-control study.
   Setting.-Five counties in Southern California.
   Participants.-A total of 200 white, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian parents of infants who died of SIDS between 1989 and 1992 were compared with 200 control parents who delivered healthy infants. Case infants were matched to control infants on the basis of birth hospital, birth date, gender, and race. All information was obtained from a detailed telephone interview and validated with medical records.
   Main Outcome Measures.-Risk of SIDS associated with passive smoking by the mother, father, live-in adults, and day care providers; smoking in the same room as the infant; total number of cigarettes smoked by all adults; and maternal smoking during the time period of breast-feeding.
   Results.-Conditional logistic regression resulted in overall adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for SIDS associated with passive smoke from the mother of 2.28, the father of 3.46, other live-in adults of 2.18, and all sources of 3.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.81 to 6.75), while simultaneously adjusting for birth weight, sleep position, prenatal care, medical conditions at birth, breast-feeding, and maternal smoking during pregnancy. A dose-response effect was noted for SIDS associated with increasing numbers of cigarettes, as well as total number of smokers. Breast-feeding was protective for SIDS among nonsmokers (OR=0.37) but not smokers (OR=1.38), when adjusting for potential confounders.
   Conclusions.-Passive smoking in the same room as the infant increases the risk for SIDS. Physicians should educate new and prospective parents about the risks of tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy and the first year of the infant's life.

Selection required that the infants were born between 24 and 32 weeks' gestation, had a normal head ultrasound and were studied at term post-menstrual age. Multi-channel pen recordings of sleep state, movement, breathing and acid reflux were made. In term and preterm infants the frequency and duration of reflux were greatest in active sleep, rare in quiet sleep and significantly less in preterm than term infants in wakefulness and active sleep (p < 0.05). The fewer and shorter episodes in preterm infants could not be explained by sleep state, movement, gestational or postnatal age, days intubated, days on oxygen or the lowest pH of reflux episodes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to characterize eye movement patterns in the human fetus at term persisting in breech presentation.
   STUDY DESIGN: Studied were 11 fetuses in breech presentation and 12 in cephalic presentation at 36 to 41 weeks' gestation, of which the presentation remained unchanged from 32 weeks' gestation until delivery. With real-time ultrasonography we analyzed three measurements by means of the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test: (1) duration of eye-movement and no-eye-movement periods, (2) frequency of eye movements, and (3) proportion of horizontal, vertical, and oblique eye movements.
   RESULTS: There were significant differences in the eye movement directions between breech and cephalic fetuses: horizontal (median 70.3% vs 80.2%), vertical (17.4% vs 11.0%), and oblique (13.1% vs 9.1%), respectively. No differences were noted in the duration of eye-movement and no-eye-movement periods or in the frequency of eye movements.
   CONCLUSION: Eye movement patterns, in direction, of term fetuses persisting in breech presentation run on a different in-utero developmental course of neural control from those in cephalic fetuses.

DE FETAL URINE PRODUCTION; FETAL BLADDER VOLUME; FETAL MICTURITION
AB The rate of fetal urine production and the incidence of fetal micturition was compared in periods of fetal sleep and awakeness. Sonography and fetal heart rate monitoring were concomitantly performed on 12 normal term pregnancies. Fetal bladder volumes were serially calculated, and the rate of urine production and micturition were compared between the periods of fetal sleep and awakeness. Fetal micturition occurred almost exclusively during periods of fetal awakeness (p = 0.001). There were no demonstrable differences in the rates of urine production during periods of fetal sleep and awakeness. Fetal micturition is behavioral-state dependent. Nevertheless, the fetal behavioral state is not a necessary consideration when applying urine production measurements as a test of fetal well-being.

AB In consideration of the frequent association of hypertension and diabetes mellitus and also taking into account the acceleration of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy by hypertension there are the following special uses of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in diabetic patients: Support in achieving the day and night tight blood pressure control according to the goals set by US recommendations on 130/85 mmHg for counterbalancing the increased cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients. After a 10-year history of diabetes even normoalbuminuric diabetics have a reduced circadian blood pressure variation compared to newly diagnosed diabetic patients or to controls. A higher blood pressure load because of a reduced fall of blood pressure during night is a typical sign of all forms of diabetic nephropathy, beginning in the stage of microalbuminuria and probably even in a ''prealbuminuric'' stage of high normal urinary albumin excretion. 10-30% of all nephropathic diabetic patients have an inverse circadian rhythm of blood pressure with higher blood pressure during night compared to daytime values. These ''inverters'' have an advanced form of autonomic neuropathy and also of orthostatic symptoms. Recent analyses of heart period variability in 24-hour electrocardiogram have shown objective signs of autonomic neuropathy not only for advanced, but also for the early form of microalbuminuric nephropathy. This form of autonomic neuropathy is usually associated with a reduced circadian blood pressure variation. In pregnancy and in autonomic hypotension after insulin-injection 24-hour blood pressure monitoring is an important aid for risk analysis.

AB Objective: To test the hypothesis that sleep disruptions would be evident in 3-year-old children with a history of prenatal marijuana exposure.
   Design: A prospective study using stratified random sampling beginning in the fourth month of pregnancy. Marijuana and other substance use were assessed by interviews at multiple time points. Offspring were followed up through age 3 years with multidomain assessments at fixed time points, including electroencephalographic sleep studies in the newborn period and at age 3 years.
   Setting: Primary care, prenatal clinic at a university hospital.
   Subjects: The sample included 18 children with prenatal marijuana exposure (mean [+/-SD] age, 39.0+/-4.4 months) and 20 control children (mean [+/-SD] age, 39.7+/-4.4 months). The two groups were similar in relationship to maternal age, race, income, education, or maternal use of alcohol, nicotine, and other substances in the first trimester.
   Main Outcome Measure: Sleep variables from polysomnographic recordings at age 3 years. Results: Children with prenatal;marijuana exposure showed more nocturnal arousals (mean [+/-SD], 8.2+/-5.3 vs 3.2+/-4.6, P<.003), more awake time after sleep onset (mean [+/-SD], 27.4+/-20.0 vs 13.7+/-12.4 min; P<.03), and lower sleep efficiency (mean [+/-SD], 91.0+/-3.8 vs 94.4+/-2.1; P<.03) than did control children.
   Conclusion: Prenatal marijuana exposure was associated with disturbed nocturnal sleep at age 3 years.

ID PROTEIN; RHYTHM; HYPERTENSION
AB Objective The hypothesis was tested that circadian variations in urinary albumin excretion of pregnant women in the third trimester of normal pregnancy are different from nonpregnant individuals.
   Design Circadian variability in urinary albumin excretion was studied both in pregnant women and in nonpregnant controls either during normal daily activities or in contrast during continuous bedrest with standardised fluid and food intake to study endogenously generated rhythm.
   Setting Outpatient department and metabolic ward of a university hospital.
   Main outcome measures Urinary albumin excretion during fixed time periods over the day and the night.
   Results Both ambulant pregnant and nonpregnant women have circadian rhythm in urinary albumin excretion but pregnant women have, firstly, a higher 24 h urinary albumin excretion, secondly, smaller relative day-night differences than nonpregnant controls and thirdly, in the metabolic ward some pregnant women demonstrate absence of rhythm.
   Conclusions The higher albumin excretion during pregnancy in 24 h urine collections can largely be explained by a higher excretion during the night, compared with that of nonpregnant women. The day-night difference in urinary albumin excretion of ambulant pregnant women is exogenously determined.

AB Chronic sympathetic denervation of the pineal gland by bilateral removal of the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) was performed on female rats 30 days before impregnation. The offspring, maintained in the dark from birth, had disruption of the malate dehydrogenase circadian rhythm in the testes at 25 days of age. A daily injection of melatonin (1 mg/kg s.c. at 10:00 or 18:00 h) to denervated mothers from the 14th day of pregnancy up to the 10th day postpartum produced one daily phase in the enzyme activity of testes in the offspring. Entrainment of daily enzyme activity also was obtained when the hormone was administered orally to the pups during the postnatal period or when pups were reared by intact (not denervated) foster mothers. The results indicate the involvement of the maternal pineal gland in the maternal transfer of photoperiodic information necessary for the coordination of the circadian system in young rats.

AB Anecdotal reports have suggested that sleeping problems are a frequent complaint from parents of preterm infants.  This prospective epidemiological study examined the incidence and stability of sleeping problems of very preterm (< 32 weeks gestation at birth), preterm (32-36 weeks gestation) and fullterm infants, all admitted to special care baby units (SCBU) after birth, in comparison to healthy term infants over the first 5 years of life.  Preterm infants were found to have fewer and shorter night-wakings at 5 months.  No differences in sleeping behaviour compared with healthy term children were found at 20 and 56 months of age.  Similar significant, and moderate, stability of nightwaking from one age to the next were found for exSCBU-graduates and healthy fullterm infants.  Parental interventions such as staying with the child until asleep and taking the infant into bed at night were related to nightwaking problems and increased parental distress.  It is concluded that prematurity, and thus neurological immaturity and special care experience are less important than caretaking behaviour in the development of sleeping problems in both preterm and fullterm infants.

AB The long-term developmental outcome of a large cohort of children suffering from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome was studied in an interdisciplinary project. Assessments using structured psychiatric interviews and intelligence tests took place during preschool age, early school age, and late school age period. There was an excess of psychopathology with a wide variety of psychiatric syndromes in this cohort. Hyperkinetic disorders, emotional disorders, sleep disorders, and abnormal habits and stereotypies persisted over time. Interview findings were largely cross-validated by parents' and teacher questionnaire findings. Only one third of the patients showed normal intellectual functioning at first examination. Intelligence test findings displayed high stability at followup. There was no significant correlation between the amount of morphological damage and intelligence. The persisting severe developmental disorders resulting from maternal alcoholism during pregnancy are also reflected in the poor school careers. Environmental factors and education do not appear to be strong compensating factors.

ID GROWTH; TRANSITIONS; HEALTHY
AB Repeated alteration in episodes of quiet sleep and active sleep is a basic feature of behavioral state organization in human fetuses. When compared to normal fetuses, at-risk fetuses generally exhibit extended periods of no coincidence (PsNC), that is, associations between state variables that cannot be classified as a sleep state. The purpose of this study was to determine if fetuses with extended PsNC differ in other state measures from fetuses with short PsNC. Fetal heart rate and fetal eye and gross body movements were collected simultaneously on 85 normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks gestation for a total of 9,135 minutes (mean 108.8 +/- 12.7 minutes, range 85-130 minutes). We found that as percent PsNC increased, the frequency (r=0.464, p < 0.0001) of state changes increased and the time spent in active sleep (r=-0.456, p < 0.0001) and the number of fetuses entering an awake state (chi(2)=4.26, p < 0.039) decreased. In contrast, percent PsNC was independent of the length of time spent in quiet sleep (r=0.070, p > 0.05). We interpret these findings as an indication that extended PsNC may be the result of disruption of homeostatic control mechanisms during active sleep.

AB Objective-To determine whether the risk of the sudden infant death syndrome is increased in bottle fed babies.
   Design-Population based case-control study matching for age and time.
   Subjects-All babies aged 1 week to 1 year dying of sudden infant death syndrome during November 1987 to April 1989 or February 1990 to June 1991 and two live controls.
   Setting-Avon and north Somerset.
   Main outcome measures-Breast or bottle feeding, sleeping position, maternal smoking, parental employment, and length of gestation.
   Results-Compared with being fully breast fed, the crude odds ratio for sudden infant death in fully bottle fed babies was 3.1 and for mixed breast and bottle fed babies 1.5. These odds ratios fell to 1.8 (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 4.8) and 1.2 (0.5 to 2.7) respectively after maternal smoking, parental employment, preterm gestation, and sleeping position had been adjusted for. Sleeping position partly masked the effect of being bottle fed on sudden infant death as breast fed babies were more likely to have slept prone than bottle fed babies.
   Conclusions-Bottle feeding is not a significant independent risk factor for the sudden infant death syndrome. Patterns of maternal smoking, preterm gestation, and parental employment status account for most of the apparent association with bottle feeding.

AB Maternal cigarette smoking has a high correlation with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, a condition in which cardiorespiratory failure occurs during an hypoxic episode, as in sleep apnea, Pregnant rats were given nicotine infusions of 2 or 6 mg/kg/day throughout gestation, regimens that produce plasma nicotine levels spanning the range in smokers. The day after birth, animals in the high dose group displayed excessive mortality during hypoxic challenge, These animals were found to be deficient in an essential response component, namely adrenomedullary catecholamine release that is required to maintain neonatal cardiac rhythm during hypoxia; the defect was in adrenal cell function rather than in altered innervation or nicotinic receptor desensitization. We also examined brainstem and forebrain noradrenergic mechanisms that are involved in neonatal respiratory control, The nicotine group showed suppressed spontaneous neuronal activity, but were hyperresponsive to hypoxia. As these projections are inhibitory for respiration, the nicotine-induced sensitization would be expected to contribute to respiratory arrest during hypoxia, Prenatal nicotine exposure may thus provide a useful animal model with which to study the physiological mechanisms that underlie Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, while at the same time providing a biological explanation for the association of the syndrome with smoking.

AB In mammals, a unidirectional communication exists between the biological flocks of the mother and fetus. As a biological clock begins oscillating in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the fetus, redundant circadian signals entrain the fetal clock to the prevailing light-dark cycle. Recent studies have revealed an activatable dopamine system within the fetal hypothalamus which may serve as a final common pathway by which maternal signals entrain the fetus. An entrained biological clock during fetal life makes the developing mammal better prepared for life in the outside world.

AB A low-molecular-weight form of human chorionic gonadotropin (hcG), urinary gonadotropin peptide (UGP), has been isolated from the urine of pregnant women and of patients with cancer, mainly of gynecological origin. The clinical value of UGP measurement in gynecological diseases is under investigation but a preliminary study is necessary in order to ascertain whether there is a circadian rhythm in UGP production, to clarify the best way to express the results, and to establish the cutoff and decisional values.
   In our work we demonstrated a significant correlation between the UGP output and the UGP excretion normalized for urinary creatinine. A very significant agreement was even found in 24-hr urine collections and UGP concentration of a single morning specimen from the same patients. No evident circadian rhythm was found, although some patients presented morning levels of UGP higher than in other collections.
   UGP postmenopausal levels were higher than premenopausal. The cutoff level, adopting the 95.0 percentile, was 200 pmol/mol creatinine. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Rats were treated with desipramine 5 mg/kg, nomifensine 10 mg/kg, zimelidine 25 mg/kg or with 0.9% sodium chloride once a day during the second and third weeks after birth, and brain stem, caudate/putamen and cortical monoamines, and caudate/putamen dopamine D-1 ((3)[H]SCH 23390) and D-2 ((3)[H]spiroperidol) receptor binding were measured when rats were at two months of age. In the brain stem, the concentration of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenyl glycol was increased in nomifensine rats and the ratio of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid to 5-hydroxytryptamine was increased in zimelidine rats. In the caudate/putamen, the concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid and the ratio of homovanillic acid to dopamine were increased in desipramine rats; neither (3)[H]SCH 23390 nor (3)[H]spiroperidol binding were affected by any of the three monoamine uptake inhibiting antidepressants studied. In the cortex, the ratio of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid to 5-hydroxytryptamine was increased in desipramine and zimelidine rats. The findings suggest that desipramine but not nomifensine increases the metabolism of dopamine in the caudate/putamen and nomifensine but not desipramine increases the metabolism of norepinephrine in the brain stem, and furthermore that the metabolism of serotonin is affected by desipramine as well as by zimelidine. It is possible that also treatment of women with these drugs during late pregnancy causes long-lasting changes in the brain of human fetus.

AB The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a circadian oscillator in mammals and shows day-night changes in metabolic activity. To investigate whether the fetal sheep SCN behaves as a circadian oscillator, day-night changes in c-fos expression, a marker of neuronal activity, were measured. Eight fetal sheep were sacrificed at 135 days gestation-four at day-time (1200 hours) and four at night-time (2400 hours). Fetal brains were fixed, removed and cut in 40-mu m serial coronal sections. Alternate sections were incubated with anti-Fos antibody (1:500) and Fos expression was revealed with extra-avidin-peroxidase and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine or stained with cresyl violet. The number of Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-ir) neurons per mm(2) in the rostral, intermediate and caudal regions of the fetal sheep SCN was counted. Fetuses sacrificed in the day-time showed a higher number of Fos-ir neurons per mm(2) (mean+/-s.e, 516.7+/-60.1) in the three regions of the SCN than fetuses sacrificed at night-time (140.5+/-21.8). In addition, at night-time Fos-ir neurons were mainly localized to the ventrolateral area of the SCN. These findings demonstrate day-night changes in molecular activity consistent with the presence of a circadian oscillator in the fetal sheep SCN.

AB The development of fetal behaviour and of fetal behavioural states (FBS) has been well defined in preterm and term fetuses. However, FBS have not yet been studied after term, although this is a potentially very dangerous period and clinical management is controversial. We investigated fetal behaviour in normal pregnancies after 41 weeks of gestation (287 days, menstrual age, GA) as compared to control term fetuses. Furthermore, we wanted to see if the findings might have consequences for clinical management. Twelve healthy women with GA between 289 and 298 days participated. All pregnancies were reliably dated and at the time of the study, there was a normal amount of fluid. Twelve healthy women with GA 273-287 days served as controls. All subjects underwent a behavioural study using cardiotocography to record the heart rate (CTG), and two ultrasound scanners to observe body and eye movements, as described previously. All fetuses in both groups clearly exhibited FBS 1F-4F which fitted the definitions of Nijhuis ct al. [5]. The median percentage of FBS 3F and 4F ('awake states') increased significantly from 6% in the term group to 21.5% in the fetuses after 41 weeks (P = 0.014). FBS 1F ('quiet sleep') and 2F ('active sleep') decreased from 92 to 78% (P = 0.014), mainly at the expense of FBS 2F which decreased from 78 to 58% (P = 0.002). This indicates increasing wakefulness in utero. The fetal heart rate patterns (FHRP) associated with FBS 3F and 4F were impressive. For example, in FBS 4F, the FHRP showed large amplitude, prolonged accelerations which fused into a sustained tachycardia with only short periods of return to the baseline, resembling tachycardia with decelerations. We conclude that in normal pregnancies after 41 weeks, the development of the fetal central nervous system continues, resulting in an increasing percentage of fetal wakefulness'. The CTG-patterns that result from these behaviours can easily mimic fetal distress and one should be aware of this phenomenon. Whether behavioural studies can be used to distinguish 'normal' from 'abnormal' fetuses after term awaits further study.

AB The biochemical mechanism of alcohol teratogenicity is not known. We have demonstrated that alcohol administration to pregnant rats during gestation days (GD) 6 and 7 and/or 13 and 14 leads to significant accumulation of ethyl esters of long chain fatty acids (FAEEs) in both maternal and fetal organs. This observation extends the report of Bearer et al. (Pediat Res 31: 492-495, 1992) who detected the presence of metabolites in maternal and fetal organs of pregnant C57Bl/6J mice exposed to alcohol on GD 7 and/or GD 14. The ethyl esters of arachidonic, linoleic, oleic, stearic and palmitic acids were major metabolites detected in both maternal and fetal organs. It was also demonstrated that detectable levels of FAEEs remain 14 days (GD 20) after initial exposure to alcohol on GD 7. Ganglioside GM1 treatment 1 and 24 hr prior to alcohol exposure on both GD 7 and/or GD 14 reduced the accumulation of FAEEs. A similar regimen was shown to prevent development of tolerance to alcohol in the adult pups exposed to alcohol in utero in our previous studies. Thus, the ganglioside GM1 may have therapeutic value in reducing neurobehavioral effects of alcohol exposure in utero.

AB This study was designed to characterize behavioral states in the fetal baboon. Automated methods were developed and validated to recognize behavioral states based on relationships among three physiologic variables (EEG patterns, eye movements, heart period variability). Data included twelve 16-h records from 3 chronically instrumented fetal baboons at 0.8-0.9 of term. Randomly generated control records were used to differentiate occurrences of state from chance association of the variables. For 41.2 +/- 4.6% (mean +/- S.E.) of the time, the physiologic variables were synchronous and formed cycles of state with a mean duration of 34.4 min. Components of these cycles had mean +/- S.E. durations of 7.2 +/- 0.3 min for state 1FB (the analogue of quiet sleep in the human infant and state 1F in the human fetus), 20.7 +/- 1.2 min for the state 2FB (the analogue of active sleep in the human infant and state 2F in the human fetus), and 3.6 +/- 0.2 min for state transitions. For 24.6 +/- 2.4% of the time, the state variables exhibited coincidental, state-like agreements, that were not part of state cycles, Finally, for 34.3 +/- 2.7% of the time, there was no systematic agreement among the three variables. These data provide convincing evidence that organized behavioral states are present in the fetal baboon as early as 0.8 of term gestation.

AB Objective To examine the behavioural state dependency of renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility index and hourly fetal urinary production rate (HFUPR) in the normal term fetus.
   Design An observational study.
   Subjects Twenty-three healthy women with a normal singleton pregnancy between 36 and 40 weeks gestation.
   Main outcome measures Renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility indices were established using pulsed Doppler ultrasound. HFUPR (ml) was estimated using real-time ultrasound. Fetal behavioural states 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep) were determined from combined recordings of fetal heart rate, eye movements and body movements.
   Results An inverse correlation between pulsatility index and fetal heart pattern was established for both the renal artery (r = 0.60; SD = 0.22; P = 0.0001) and the descending aorta (r = 0.73; SD = 0.16; P = 0.0001). The difference in mean pulsatility index between states 1F and 2F adjusted for fetal heart pattern was 0.09 (SD 0.23) for the renal artery (P = 0.02) and 0.26 (SD 0.19) for the descending aorta (P = 0.0001). Mean HFUPR was significantly higher (44.8 %, P = 0.01) in state 1F (96 ml) compared with state 2F (54 ml) During the urinary filling phase, a poor correlation existed between renal artery pulsatility index and HFUPR (r = 0.04) and between descending aorta pulsatility index and HFUPR (r = 0.01).
   Conclusions In the normal term fetus renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility indices are reduced during fetal behavioural state 2F, suggesting reduced downstream impedance at the fetal trunk and in particular at renal level. This behavioural state is, however, also associated with reduced micturition. No correlation exists between renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility indices and fetal urinary output.

AB The purpose of this paper was to calculate vagal tone (V) for 17 normal human fetuses in quiet sleep (QS) between 36 and 40 weeks gestation. The fetal cardiac electrical signal was captured transabdominally in 3-min blocks at a rate of 833 times per second and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal processing techniques. Fetal R-wave interbeat intervals were converted to equally spaced, time-based data, and the low-frequency component was removed using a 21-point third-order moving polynomial. The parameter V was calculated by taking the natural logarithm of the sum of the power densities between 0.3 Hz and 1.3 Hz. We found that fetal breathing was associated with an approximately 25% increase in V as compared to nonbreathing, 3.33 +/- 0.48 versus 2.57 +/- 0.47, p < 0.0001. Furthermore, there was a significant linear relationship between the mean single-fetus V during spontaneous respiration and the mean single-fetus V during normally occurring apneic periods, r = 0.772, p < 0.002. We conclude that respiratory activity is associated with a significant increase in vagal tone for normal human fetuses in QS. (C) 1994 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

AB The teratogenic effect of caffeine has been clearly demonstrated in rodents. The sensitivity of different animals species is variable. Malformations have been demonstrated in mice at 50-75 mg/kg of caffeine, whereas the lowest dose usually needed to induce malformations is 80 mg/kg in rats. However, when caffeine is administered in fractioned amounts during the day, 330 mg/kg/day are necessary to reach teratogenicity in rats. In rodents, the most frequently observed malformations are those of the limbs and digits, ectrodactyly, craniofacial malformations (labial and palatal clefts) and delays in ossification of limbs, jaw and sternum. Nevertheless, even in rodents, caffeine can be considered as a weak teratogenic agent, given the quite large quantities of caffeine necessary to induce malformations and the small number of animals affected. In humans, caffeine does not present any teratogenic risk. The increased risk of the most common congenital malformations entailed by moderate consumption of caffeine is very slight. However, caffeine potentiates the teratogenic effect of other substances, such as tobacco, alcohol, and acts synergistically with ergotamine and propranolol to induce materno-fetal vasoconstrictions leading to malformations induced by ischemia. Therefore, even though caffeine does not seem to be harmful to the human fetus when intake is moderate and spread out over the day, some associations, especially with alcohol, tobacco, and vasoconstrictive or anti-migraine medications should be avoided.
   Maternal consumption of caffeine affects brain composition, especially in case of a low-protein diet and also seems to interfere with zinc fixation in brain. Maternal exposure to caffeine induces also long-term consequences on sleep, locomotion, learning abilities, emotivity, and anxiety in rat offspring, whereas in humans, more studies are needed to ascertain long-term behavioral effects of caffeine ingestion by pregnant mothers.

AB White male rats, intact and pregnant females were subjected for 3 days to deprivation of paradoxical sleep by the technique of Jouvet.  The main resulting vectors of the extreme state outcome, i.e., lethality, susceptibility to stress, and neurotization, made it possible to establish corresponding levels of resistance.  A relationship of each of the levels with the ability to form conditioned reflexes, initial functional interhemispheric asymmetry and behavioural status, expression of protective reactions and paradoxical sleep under conditions of an insoluble conflict situation was followed.  High resistance of pregnant rats is considered to be associated with the formation of gestational ambilaterality of the brain of intact animals.  Such an increase in resistance is selective as far as it concerns the organism of the pregnant and it does not ensure stability of the feto-maternal complex under extreme conditions.  It was established that there was an inverse relationship between the expression of neurotic disorders of the higher nervous activity and vegeto-morphological features of acute stress.  This gives reason to define more exactly the role of neurotic disorders in the pathogenesis of stress and mechanisms of resistance to extreme factors.

ID BRAIN GANGLIOSIDES; SLEEP TIME; MICE; INUTERO
AB We have investigated the effect of in utero ethanol exposure and ganglioside GM1 pretreatment on the endogenous ganglioside profile of the rat fetal brain. Prenatal ethanol exposure on gestation day (GD)7 and GD8 and/or GD13 end GD14 leads to a very significant increase in the ganglioside GM1 content in at least 50% of the pup brains when assayed on GD20. This treatment protocol also results in significant decrease in the content of polysialogangliosides GD1a, GT1b, and GQ1b. GM1 treatment of pregnant dams before ethanol administration prevented this alteration in pup brain ganglioside profile. Ganglioside GM1 pretreatment appears to block the cellular membrane changes associated with fetal alcohol effects and thereby minimizes alterations in brain maturation and associated behavioral dysfunction.

AB Catheters were placed in the jugular vein and femoral artery of male Sprague-Dawley rats and connected to a specially designed perfusor for continuous constant infusion of 0.9% NaCl and a syringe to perform simultaneous and intermittent blood collections. This permitted continuous 24-h study of renal hemodynamics, estimated by inulin (C-in) and p-amino-hippuric acid (C-PAH) clearances; C-in represents glomerular filtration rate and C-PAH renal plasma flow. Animals were individually housed in metabolism cages in a controlled environment with light/dark 12:12 h. Urine was collected every 4 h (12:00, 16:00, 20:00, 24:00, 04:00, and 08:00) and blood sampled at the midpoint of urine collection periods. Urine and plasma sodium, potassium, inulin, and PAH were spectrophotometrically assessed. During continuous infusion of isotonic saline, C-in exhibited circadian changes with large decrease between 12:00 and 20:00 h (0.9 +/- 0.2 ml/min) and acrophase at 00:30 h. Rhythmicity in C-PAH was similar with the minimum between 16:00 and 20:00 h (2.5 +/- 0.3 ml/min) and peak between 00:00 and 04:00 h (acrophase at 00:25 h), Water and electrolyte excretion were also circadian rhythmic with a similar nighttime enhancement and daytime minimum. Such circadian changes persisted during continuous 0.9% NaCl infusion for several consecutive days. The unanesthetized, unrestrained rat model enables investigations in renal chronopharmacology and chronotoxicology.

AB We have investigated the effect of exposure of newborn lambs to continuous light during the first 2 weeks after birth on the subsequent development of the phase and amplitude of the plasma melatonin rhythm during the next 8 weeks. During the first 2 weeks after birth, the mean plasma melatonin concentrations were significantly lower (P < 0.001) in lambs exposed to continuous light (58 +/- 15 pmol/l, 7) than in lambs exposed to LD 12:12 (i.e., ''normal'' lighting: 189 +/- 38 pmol/l, n = 9). Between 3 and 4 weeks of age, plasma melatonin concentrations during the daily light and dark periods were also significantly lower in the lambs exposed to continuous light during the first 2 weeks after birth. There was no effect of time of day on plasma melatonin in either group of lambs during the first 2 weeks after birth but between 3 and 10 weeks of age there was a significant (P < 0.001) effect of light and dark and time of day on plasma melatonin concentrations which was the same in both groups of lambs. Plasma melatonin concentrations were higher in the dark period than in the light period and between 2100 and 0700 than between 0900 and 1700 at all ages after week 2. We have therefore demonstrated that exposure of the lamb to 2 weeks of continuous light after birth results in a suppression of melatonin secretion that extends beyond the end of the exposure to continuous light.

AB The impairment of sleep quality is a common complaint during pregnancy. To investigate the changes in sleep in the course of pregnancy, the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded and analyzed in nine healthy women on 2 consecutive nights during each trimester of pregnancy. Waking after sleep onset increased from the second (TR2) to the third (TR3) trimester, whereas rapid eye movement (REM) sleep decreased from the first trimester (TR1) to TR2. Spectral analysis of the EEG in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep revealed a progressive reduction of power density in the course of pregnancy. In comparison to TR1, the values in TR2 were significantly lower in the 10.25-11.0-Hz and 14.25-17.0-Hz bands. In TR3, the significant reduction extended over the ranges of 1.25-12.0 Hz and 13.25-16.0 Hz. The largest decrease (30%) occurred in the 14.25-15.0-Hz band. In REM sleep, the spindle frequency range was not affected, and a minor reduction of power density in some frequency bins below 12 Hz was present only in TR3. The study documents major alterations of the sleep EEG that are not evident from the sleep scores and that may be associated with the characteristic hormonal changes occurring during pregnancy.

AB In 14 normally developing term fetuses, the relationship between the blood flow velocity waveforms at cerebral arterial level (internal carotid artery, anterior, middle and posterior cerebral artery) and fetal behavioural states was studied using Doppler colour flow imaging. Behavioural state dependent changes in absolute flow velocities occurred in all vessels, except for the middle cerebral artery. These changes suggest preferential blood flow to the left heart resulting in increased flow to the cerebrum during fetal behavioural state 2F (active sleep) when compared with fetal behavioural state 1F(quiet sleep). The middle cerebral artery supplies the neocerebrum. This developing part of the cerebrum does not seem to take part in the regulation of fetal behaviour. In the internal carotid artery, an inverse relationship between peak systolic velocity and fetal heart rate could be established, which can be explained by a shorter rapid filling phase at raised fetal heart rate according to the Frank-Starling Law.

ID DEATH-SYNDROME; TEMPERATURE; PREGNANCY; APNEA; SLEEP; BIRTH
AB It is strange that some aspects of infant care have been strongly promoted by modern medicine while others have been neglected. Thus prone sleeping which has been strongly promoted is now related to an increase in SIDS, whereas the promotion of breast feeding in developed countries has been less successful. Unfortunately there has not been sufficient physiological investigation of many infant care practices and some of the proposed mechanisms for SIDS and prone sleeping have not been substantiated. Thus further work is needed on hypercapnia, hypothermia and periodic breathing and respiratory control. Studying infants alone may leave out important physiological mechanisms Such as the effect on body warmth when the infant is close to the mother. More investigation is needed of antenatal factors related to SIDS and it is critically important that physiological investigation should not look for single mechanisms but be concerned with the interaction of many physiological factors.

AB The response of prolactin (PRL) and that of the pituitary-testicular axis to inhibitory photoperiods were compared in immature and young adult hamsters. In the first experiment, 14-day-old hamsters were transferred from 14L:10D to 12L:12D or 8L:16D. At 21, 28, 35, and 49 days of age, body weights, testes weights, and plasma LH were similar in all groups. In contrast, the levels of PRL were lower in animals on 8L:16D or 12L:12D than in those on 14L:10D at 35 and 49 days of age. In a second experiment, 80-day-old hamsters were transferred from 14L:10D to either 12L:12D or 8L:16D. At 5-wk intervals, they were weighed and bled by cardiocentesis and the length of the testes was measured. Photoperiods of 12L:12D and 8L:16D induced testicular regression, which was complete by 15 wk Thereafter, augmented levels of FSH preceded spontaneous recrudescence of the testes in animals on both photoperiods. Serum PRL levels were significantly depressed within 5 wk after transfer to either 8L:16D or 12L:12D. After 15 wk as the testes were increasing in size in both groups, circulating PRL levels increased in animals exposed to 8L:16D, whereas in animals exposed to 12L:12D, PRL remained at or below the sensitivity of the assay. In a final experiment, on the day before parturition, pregnant hamsters were transferred to either 6L:18D, 6L:30D, 6L:42D, or 6L:54D or were held on 14L:10D. There were no differences in testicular weights, plasma LH, or plasma thyroxine (T-4) of the pups from these dams at 21, 36, or 48 days of age. On the other hand, PRL levels at these ages were elevated in the 6L:30D and the 6L:54D groups as compared to the 6L:18D and the GL:42D groups. The results suggest that the response of PRL to photoperiod may be experimentally dissociated from that of the hypothalamo-pituitary-testis axis to photoperiod. Like the response of the reproductive system in the adult, the response of PRL incorporates a circadian oscillator in the system that measures day length.

TI THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF COUNTING FETAL MOVEMENTS
SO BIRTH-ISSUES IN PERINATAL CARE
LA English
DT Article
ID SERUM ALPHA-FETOPROTEIN; DEATH
AB By identifying a change in fetal activity state, fetal movement counting may help to reduce the possibility of stillbirth.  Concern has arisen that such a focus on fetal activity may cause undue maternal anxiety.  A prospective, controlled trial was conducted to determine whether fetal movement counting induced anxiety or other deleterious psychological effects in low-risk primigravidas.  A sample of 613 healthy pregnant women was randomly assigned at 28 weeks' gestation to fetal movement counting, sleep recording, or a nonrecording control group.  State and trait of anxiety, belief in sources of personal control, and attitudes toward pregnancy and infant were assessed at 28 and 37 weeks' gestation.  Participation rates were high (91.4%) across all groups.  Most women (90%) assigned to count fetal movements did so on a daily basis (95% of days).  No significant changes in psychological status occurred in the three groups as a result of self-monitoring conditions.  Independent of group assignment, all women showed a slight increase in transient state and decrease in trait of anxiety from 28 to 37 weeks.  Internal locus of control and positive attitudes toward the infant increased slightly, and feelings of well-being decreased slightly for all women.  It was concluded that women are willing to record fetal activity, and that fetal movement counting does not cause deleterious psychological effects in low-risk pregnant women.

AB Prenatal treatment with the D-1-dopamine receptor agonist SKF 38393 or cocaine induces expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos in the fetal rat suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (Weaver et al., 1992). Because the induction of c-fos gene expression in the SCN has been implicated in the entrainment of circadian rhythms by light in mature animals, the present study investigated whether prenatal dopaminergic activation entrains the fetal circadian pacemaker. Injections of SKF 38393 (8 mg/kg) were given to pregnant, SCN-lesioned hamsters during the last 5 d of gestation and the phases of the offspring's wheel-running activity rhythms were measured on postnatal day 20. Pregnant hamsters were each given two injections/day 12 hr apart, but only one of the injections each day contained SKF 38393. One group of hamsters received the drug at 0800 hr while another group received the drug at 2000 hr. The offspring from these treatment groups showed average phases that differed by 11.3 hr, demonstrating that prenatal SKF 38393 set the phase of the offspring's circadian rhythms. These results suggest that the fetal circadian pacemaker can be entrained by dopaminergic activation. In situ hybridization using cRNA probes demonstrated that a single injection of SKF 38393 on the last day of gestation induced c-fos gene expression in the fetal hamster SCN and that mRNA for the D-1-dopamine receptor was present in the SCN at that time. It is possible that maternal entrainment of the fetal circadian pacemaker, which normally occurs during development, is mediated by dopaminergic activation within the fetal hypothalamus.

AB We investigated the possible effects of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on sleep-wake phases and other associated behaviors controlled by the medial preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic epidural electroencephalographic (EEG) and temporal muscle electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were placed in cycling female rats. After a week of recovery, rats were injected intraperitoneally at 3.00 pm on the day of proestrus with either saline or highly purified hCG or indomethacin or hCG plus indomethacin. Three hours after injection, EEG, EMG and behavioral activities were recorded for 3.5 h. The administration of hCG increased high and low amplitude sleep, resting phase and decreased active awake phase, walking, sniffing and chewing as compared to the controls. While the administration of indomethacin alone had no effect, coadministration inhibited hCG effects. Medial preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus contain immunostaining for LH/hCG receptors. The administration of hCG resulted in an increase of immunoreactive PGD(2) and a decrease of PGE(2) in median preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus as compared to the controls. In summary, hCG administration affects sleep-wake phases and other associated behaviors in rats which can collectively be described as decreased activity. These effects are probably mediated by increasing PGD(2) and decreasing PGE(2) in areas of brain which control these activities. The above findings may be relevant to pregnant women who experience decreased activity when hCG is present in the circulation and cerebrospinal fluid.

AB Objective To determine the effect of maternal administration of dexamethasone on fetal heart rate and its variation.
   Design Retrospective analysis of computerised data derived from cases studied over three years.
   Setting High risk pregnancy unit, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.
   Subjects Twenty-eight pregnant women, at 27 to 32 weeks of gestation, to whom dexamethasone was given to accelerate pulmonary maturation in the expectation of preterm delivery.
   Methods Dexamethasone (two doses of 12 mg intramuscularly, 12 h apart) was given on 51 occasions at weekly intervals (one to four occasions per patient). Complete data were available for cardiotocograph analysis from computerised measurement of fetal heart rate variables for two days before and four days after dexamethasone and, in 19 women, measurements of umbilical arterial flow velocity waveforms before and after dexamethasone.
   Results In 10 pregnancies without fetal distress there was a highly significant (P < 0.01) transient rise in short term fetal heart rate variation after dexamethasone administration, from means (SE) 6 4 (0.28) to 9 8 (0.4) ms. In 18 pregnancies with subsequent delivery for fetal distress (abnormal fetal heart rate pattern) and high umbilical arterial resistance index [mean 0.93 (0 06 SE)], the rise in short term fetal heart rate variation was less (P < 0.01), from mean (SE) 5.4 (0.26) to 6.1 (0.48) ms. In a further case of discordant twin pregnancy, the larger twin continued to respond to dexamethasone administrations with a rise in fetal heart rate variation for five weeks; the smaller twin, with maintained tachycardia and reduced umbilical arterial end-diastolic flow velocity, failed to respond after the first two weeks.
   Conclusion The results show that maternal dexamethasone administration normally causes a rise in fetal heart rate variation for up to a day. This rise is reduced in pre-eclampsia or intrauterine growth retardation, associated with a reduction in umbilical flow, perhaps because of a consequential lower concentration of steroid in the fetus. The results contrast with those for betamethasone which has been reported to reduce fetal heart rate variation.

AB Background. This study sought explanations for the proneness to respiratory events in young Australian children.
   Methods. Prospective respiratory symptom diaries on 836 children collected data on respiratory symptoms and episodes. Questionnaires to mothers and birth and pregnancy records provided 56 known and possible predictors which were tested against two summary respiratory outcomes in each of the first and second years of life.
   Results. The two summary respiratory variables recorded for first and second year of life give four outcome variables. In fitting multivariate regression models to predict outcomes, use of child care in early childhood and mothers' experience of respiratory illness in the 12 months before birth were significant predictors for all four outcomes. Number of siblings was a predictor for three of the four outcomes. Sleep difficulty during pregnancy in the mother, and respiratory hospitalization of the infant in the first year, were significant predictors for both first-year outcomes. Unexpected and unexplained findings emerged tot alcohol intake during pregnancy, passive smoking and breastfeeding in relation to the second year respiratory outcomes. Less than 9% of Variance in outcome scores was explained in any of the four multiple regression models but this rose to between 24% and 31% when a corresponding scare from the other year was added to the model.
   Conclusions. Proneness to respiratory illness is an important entity; its determinants are largely unknown and events in pregnancy or the perinatal period explain only a small proportion of the between-infant variability.

AB Oxygenation produced by distending the lungs with 100% O-2 increases the occurrence of arousal and fetal breathing movements (FBM), particularly during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, in fetal sheep of greater than or equal to 135 days of gestation. We studied the breathing and behavioral responses to a rise in arterial Po-2 (Pa-o2) without lung distension in fetuses between 128 and 132 days of gestation. Twelve fetuses were chronically instrumented to record FBM, behavioral state, blood pressure, arterial blood gas tensions, and pH. Fetal Pa-o2 was raised by having the ewe breathe 100% O-2 at 3 atmosphere absolute pressure spontaneously (group I, n = 5, 129 +/- 1 days of gestation) or with mechanical ventilation to control fetal arterial Pco(2) (group 2, n = 7, 131 +/- 1 days of gestation). Hyperbaric oxygenation raised fetal Pa-o2 by 20 Torr in both groups. During hyperbaric oxygenation, the occurrence of arousal increased severalfold in both groups. The occurrence of FBM increased during arousal in both groups, during rapid-eye-movement sleep in group I, and during NREM sleep in group 2. The timing of diaphragmatic activity during arousal and the variability of diaphragmatic activity during NREM sleep were different than those in rapid-eye-movement sleep. We conclude that oxygenation without lung distension increases the occurrence of arousal and of FBM, principally during arousal and NREM sleep, in fetuses of less than or equal to 135 days of gestation.

AB Conflicting data are published regarding the influence of acid gastroesophageal reflux on the heart rate. In this study, heart rate was monitored simultaneously with esophageal pH in 50 infants with symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (frequent vomiting and regurgitations). The data of 25 preterm infants (born at 28-366/7 weeks) were compared to those of 25 term infants (born after 37 weeks of gestation). However, both groups were investigated at identical postconceptional age of 47-49 weeks. Not one significant bradycardia (heart rate less than or equal to 80/min during greater than or equal to 10 s) was recorded, although 71 ''relative bradycardia episodes'' (heart rate less than or equal to 80/min during greater than or equal to 5 beats) were detected, none lasting for >5 s. Although the number of infants with relative bradycardia episodes did not differ between groups, the relative bradycardia episodes occurred more frequently in some preterm infants (53 episodes in preterm infants vs. 18 in term babies). Acid gastroesophageal reflux episodes were observed in 46 infants (92%). Neither the number of reflux episodes nor their duration was different in both groups. Simultaneous relative bradycardia episodes and acid reflux episodes were observed in three of 23 preterm and two of 23 term infants (NS). It is concluded that in a population of preterm and term infants with symptoms suggestive of a moderate gastroesophageal reflux pathology, investigated at comparable postconceptional age, most reflux episodes are not time-related to changes in heart rate.

AB The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) have daily fluctuations in energy consumption with glucose utilization high in the day, and low at night. In a previous study, we used [C-14]2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake to index the phase of the SCN, and found that in intact hamsters bearing SCN grafts in the third ventricle (3V), the native and grafted SCN, which were initially 12 h out of phase, became synchronized to the phase of the host clock [32]. In the present study, adult males (host animals) and pregnant females (source of donor tissue) were housed in opposite light-dark cycles. Host animals were sacrificed 14 days after implantation with either (1) SCN grafts into the lateral ventricle (LV), or (2) cortical grafts into 3V, or (3) SCN grafts in 3V of pinealectomized hamster. The results indicate that rhythms of 2-DG uptake are not induced in cortical tissue grafts, that the host SCN does not entrain SCN grafts located in the LV, and that entrainment of the grafted SCN (located in 3V) by the host circadian system occurs in the absence of pineal secretions.

TI EARLY HEART-RATE RESPONSE OF NORMAL HUMAN TERM FETUSES TO VIBROACOUSTIC
   STIMULATION

DE HUMAN FETUS; HABITUATION; CARDIAC REACTIVITY; AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM
AB We examined cardiac reactivity in the first 45 seconds following a single 1 second vibroacoustic stimulus (VAS) to determine if the prestimulus fetal heart rate (FH R) pattern was predictive of the immediate post-VAS heart rate response. Forty-nine normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation were observed to enter quiet sleep and remain in that state for 3 to 5 minutes before testing. In general, VAS elicited an initial acceleratory response of approximately 20 beats/min above the mean prestimulus heart rate followed by a deceleratory response to an average of approximately 4 beats/min below baseline values. Fetuses with different average prestimulus heart rate patterns generally differed in their early cardiac response to VAS: when compared to a high baseline FHR, a low resting heart rate was associated with a greater increase in heart rate above baseline (r = -0.401; P = 0.03), a greater decrease below prestimulus values (r = -0.312; P = 0.03) and a greater difference between maximum and minimum heart rates (r = -0.465; P = 0.007). Higher baseline heart rates were associated with lower FHR variability in the prestimulus period (r = -0.422; P = 0.009). When we examined the time course of the early response, we found that fetuses that achieved a maximum heart rate quickly exhibited less of an increase above prestimulus values (r = 0.894; P = 0.005), displayed a greater decrease below baseline (r = 0.507; P = 0.0002), and reached the minimum heart rate faster (r = 0.575; P = 0.0001) than fetuses that required longer to achieve a maximum cardiac response. In light of the relationship between heart rate and autonomic nervous system activity, these findings suggest that cardiac reactivity in the human fetus may reflect individual differences in resting sympathetic-parasympathetic balance.

Actigraphic data were analysed by an automated scoring procedure developed in the authors' laboratory. There were no significant differences in activity levels between IVF multiple-birth subjects and their matched controls or between IVF singletons and their matched controls. In contrast, multiple-birth subjects had higher activity levels during sleep and lower sleep efficiency than singletons in both IVF and control groups. Sleep measures showed night-to-night stability in all groups.

AB Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a clinical manifestation of the parasympathetic nervous system which can be identified in the high-frequency region of the heart rate variability (HRV) power spectrum. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative contribution of RSA to overall HRV for human fetuses in quiet sleep. The study population consisted of 13 normal human fetuses between 36 and 40 weeks of gestation for whom data were collected during spontaneous breathing and normally occurring apneic periods. Fetal breathing was monitored continuously using real-time sonography. The fetal electrocardiogram was captured transabdominally in 3-min blocks at a rate of 833 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted from the raw signal using adaptive signal processing techniques. Fetal behavioral state was determined at the beginning and end of each 3-min data collection period. The fetal R-wave interbeat intervals (IBIs) were converted to equally-spaced, time-based data, and linear detrending of the time series was accomplished by subtracting the mean heart period from each weighted IBI. Total power (TP, 0.0-2.5 Hz) was divided into RSA (0.4-1.0 Hz), high-frequency (HF, 0.2-2.5 Hz), low-frequency (LF, 0.04-0.2 Hz), and very-low-frequency (VLF, 0.0-0.04 Hz) regions, and the power densities were summed to determine the absolute power for each frequency component. A total of 81 3-min blocks (mean per subject 6.3, range 2-14) were available for analysis. Eleven (85%) of 13 fetuses demonstrated a HF peak during fetal breathing, and RSA accounted for approximately 20% of the TP. Although HF amplitude was reduced in the absence of fetal respiratory activity, RSA did not invariably disappear during periods of apnea, as the HF peak was recognized in seven (54%) fetuses when no respiratory activity was observed. Total power was approximately evenly distributed between the VLF, LF, and HF regions, and this distribution was independent of whether the fetus was breathing or not. However, the absolute power was significantly greater (P < 0.05) during breathing as compared to non-breathing for TP and for the VLF, LF, HF, and RSA components. We conclude that RSA is common in normal human fetuses and is a significant factor contributing to HRV.

AB This report examines the hypothesis that the characteristics of breathing activity of the fetal baboon are modulated with respect to sleep state in a fashion similar to that observed in the human fetus. The pattern of fetal breathing activity was examined in relationship to electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep state in studies of six fetuses of chronically monitored pregnant baboons at 143-148 days of gestation (term, 175-180 days). Fetal breaths were defined by fluctuations of tracheal fluid pressure. EEG sleep states were defined with an automated method for discrimination of EEG patterns that are standard indices of quiet and active sleep in immature primates. During more than 250 h of recorded data, the fetuses spent on average 33.3 +/- 3.9% of time in EEG quiet sleep. In comparisons across state the fetuses spent significantly (P = 0.001) less time breathing during quiet than active sleep (49.5 +/- 6.8 vs. 69.0 +/- 3.8%). The inspiratory and expiratory time intervals of fetal breaths were not differentiated by EEG state but, the mean breath to breath interval was significantly (P < 0.001) longer in EEG quiet sleep. In addition to these differences in incidence and time interval of breaths, during epochs of breathing, there was a significantly slower rate, lower amplitude, and lower variability of rate of breathing in quiet sleep (all P-values < 0.02). Thus, periodic breathing activity in the fetal baboon is present in both quiet and active EEG sleep states. Sleep states have a powerful influence on patterns of fetal breathing in the non-human primate, directly comparable to the human fetus.

AB We examined the 24 hour plasma profiles of prolactin and beta-hCG in 7 women with preterm labour between the 30th and 34th week of gestation. The results showed that, despite preterm labour, the circadian rhythm of prolactin was maintained. The beta-hCG levels showed a wide scattering in the normal range which is also characteristic of pregnancy with no complications. In addition we examined the prolactin and beta-hCG levels during the last 6 hours preceding delivery. Here we found significant higher hormone concentrations of hCG in the mothers delivered of female babies than in the mothers of males. This higher hormone level declined continuously during the delivery, however, without significance. We also observed concordant secretion patterns of prolactin and beta-hCG in these cases. Normal hCG and prolactin values were found in mothers delivered of male babies.

AB Several 24-h rhythms have been observed in the mother and in the fetus during primate gestation. In the mother, 24-h rhythms occur in biophysical variables, pregnancy-associated plasma hormones and preparturient myometrial activity. In addition, both pregnant non-human primates and pregnant women deliver preferentially during the night and early morning hours. A crucial question pertaining circadian rhythms is whether 24-h rhythms that may be observed during pregnancy are endogenous in nature and entrained by the light-dark cycle or whether the daily photoperiod is a causal stimulus. Our work has addressed the role of the maternal and fetal circadian system for 24-h rhythms in pregnancy-associated maternal plasma hormones, preparturient myometrial activity and parturition in human and non-human primate pregnancy. In the present review, the results of some of our studies are being discussed in combination with data available from the literature. It is apparent that 24-h rhythms that may be observed during primate pregnancy are determined by the maternal circadian system, suggesting that the developing fetus receives information about the ambient time of the day via the mother. Fetal entrainment by the mother may ensure fetal cooperation so that parturition occurs at the most favorable time of the day. We conclude that the functioning of the maternal circadian system is integral to the pregnant state. Thus, proper care and management of pregnant women and the ultimate outcome of obstetrics may benefit from more timely methodologies. A chronopharmacological attitude towards the prevention of premature labor and the induction and augmentation of labor at term may yield new therapeutic strategies. Such an approach will enable delivery to take place under optimal conditions for mother and child.

AB General pharmacological effects of the human corticotropin-releasing hormone, corticorelin (human) (CAS 86784-80-7), on the central nervous system, somatic nervous system, autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle, respiratory and circulatory system, digestive system and miscellaneous organs were investigated 1. The central nervous system: Corticorelin (human) had little effect on hexobarbital-induced sleeping-time, maximal electroshock-induced convulsion, acetic acid-induced writhing, rota-rod performance. Corticorelin (human) at doses of more than 10 mu g/kg i.v. induced flush of skin and pilo-erection, at doses of more than 30 mu g/kg i.v. decreased body temperature, delayed expression of perphenazine-induced catalepsy and indicated hunched posture and at the dose of 100 mu g/kg i.v. induced the rise of awake-level and decrease of the total power of EEG, and decreased the spontaneous motor activity 2. The somatic nervous system:. Corticorelin (human) did not cause muscle relaxation in mice and had little effect on neuromuscular transmission in rats. No local anesthetic activity of corticorelin (human) was exhibited through inhibition of the corneal reflex in guinea pigs. 3. The autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle: Corticorelin (human) had no effect on the contraction of isolated ileum of guinea pigs induced by histamine and acetylcholine, and on the contraction of isolated trachea of guinea pigs induced by histamine, and the pupil diameter of rabbits. Corticorelin (human) at doses more than 30 mu g/kg i.v. decreased spontaneous motility and contractile force of uterus of non-pregnant rabbits. 4. The respiratory and circulatory system: Corticorelin (human) had no effect on the contraction of isolated aorta of rats induced by norepinephrine. Corticorelin (human) at doses of more than 3 mu g/kg i.v. decreased the blood pressure, increased heart rates and slightly increased the number of respiration in dogs. However, corticorelin (human) had no effect on ECG and femoral blood flow in dogs. 5. The digestive system: Corticorelin (human) at doses of mole than 0.3 mu g/kg i.v. increased duodenal motility and contractile force, at doses of more than 1 mu g/kg i.v. increased colonic contractile force transiently and increased antral mortility. Corticorelin (human) at doses of mole than 3 mu g/kg i.v. caused diarrhea and at doses of more than 30 mu g/kg i.v. inhibited small intestinal propulsion in mice. Corticorelin (human) at dose of 100 mu g/kg i.v. showed an inhibition of the gastric juice secretion and decreased the excretion of Na+, Cl- and H+ in rats. Corticorelin (human) produced slight gastric damages only at the highest close of 100 mu g/kg i.v. 6. Other properties: Corticorelin (human) had no effect on the carrageenan-induced edema formation and on the blood coagulation process and did not show hemolytic effects. Corticorelin (human) at doses of more than 3 mu g/kg increased the excretion of urinary K+. Corticorelin (human) at doses of more than 30 mu g/kg i.v. increased the plasma glucose level. The results show that corticorelin (human) has little effect on the central nervous system, the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle except on the respiratory and circulatory system and the digestive system. Because all of the effects are weak and observed at relatively high doses, it is suggested that corticorelin (human) is acceptable in clinical use.

ID FETAL LAMB; LOCALIZATION; PATTERNS; SLEEP
AB In this study, we introduce the wavelet transform (WT) as a method for characterizing the maturational changes in electrocortical activity in 24 fetal lambs ranging from 110-144 days gestation (term 145 days). The WT, based on multiresolution signal decomposition, is free of assumptions regarding the characteristics of the signal. The approximation of the electrocortical activity at resolutions varying from 2(j+1) to 2(j) can be extracted by decomposing the signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L(2)(R). We performed multiresolution decomposition for four sets of parameters D-2j, where - 1 < j < - 4. The four series WT represent the detail signal bandwidths: (1) 16-32 Hz, (2) 8-16 Hz, (3) 4-8 Hz, (4) 2-4 Hz. The data were divided into three groups according to gestational age: 110-122 days (early), 123-135 days (middle), and 136-144 days (late). In the early group, the power was highest in the fourth signal bandwidth, with relatively low power in the other bands. Increase in gestational age was characterized by increased power in all four bandwidths. Comparison of the cumulative distribution function of the power in the four wavelet bands confirmed the presence of two statistically different patterns in all three age groups. These two patterns correspond to the visually identified patterns of HVSA (high-voltage slow activity) and LVFA (low-voltage fast activity). The earliest development change occurred in HVSA, with progressive increase in power in the 2-8 Hz band. Later changes occurred in LVFA, with a significant increase in power in the 16-32 Hz band. The same database was also analyzed by the short-term Fourier transform (STFT) method, the most common time-frequency analysis method. Comparison of the results clearly show that the WT provided much better time-frequency resolution than the STFT method and was superior in demonstrating maturational changes in electrocortical activity.

AB Behavioural state dependent changes occur in the circulation of the normally developing human fetus at term. During fetal behavioural state 2F (active sleep), there seems to be preferential blood flow through the ductus venosus and foramen ovale into the left heart. Increased left ventricular output of well-oxygenated blood during fetal behavioural state 2F will be necessary to meet the raised energy demands both at cerebral and trunk level as demonstrated by reduced pulsatility index values in the descending aorta, renal artery and intracranial arteries during this behavioural state. The limited studies in IUGR suggest behavioural state independency in the descending aorta and internal carotid artery which may be attributed to the fetus being incapable of adjusting its circulation to the existing behavioural state in the presence of circulatory centralization.

AB To determine whether hypoxemia inhibits fetal activity by substances from the mother or placenta, six fetal lambs were chronically instrumented at 128-132 days gestation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Severe maternal hypoxemia (arterial PO2 decreased to 6.00 +/- 0.60 kPa) was produced while fetal arterial PO2 was maintained normoxic or mildly hyperoxic using ECMO. The incidences of fetal breathing movements were 34.8 +/- 3.1% (SE) during baseline before ECMO, 36.8 +/- 3.4% during baseline with ECMO, and 21.4 +/- 3.5% (P < 0.05 compared with baseline with ECMO) during maternal hypoxemia. The durations of periods of breathing were 9.8 +/- 1.2 min before ECMO, 9.3 +/- 1.1 min with ECMO, and 10.5 +/- 1.7 min (P = NS) during maternal hypoxemia. In 7 of 14 maternal hypoxemia experiments, breathing activity stopped too late (7-23 min) to be attributed to maternal hypoxemia. Fetal electrocorticographic activity (P = NS), nuchal electromyographic activity (P = NS), and eye movements were normal before ECMO, with ECMO, and during maternal hyperemia. Fetal blood pressure and heart rate did not change. We conclude that the inhibition of fetal activity during maternal hypoxemia does not seem to be mediated by release of factors from the maternal side of the placenta or the ewe.

AB Narcolepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, and other rapid-eye-movement (REM)-sleep phenomena such as sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. Although stimulants are the only effective treatment for the sleepiness of narcolepsy, no clinical guidelines on the use of stimulants in the treatment of narcolepsy have been published that address the following factors: appropriate doses; development of tolerance; potential for side effects, adverse reactions and abuse; and use in children and pregnant or breast-feeding women. These practice parameters from the American Sleep Disorders Association provide the first clinical guidelines on the appropriate use of stimulants in the treatment of narcolepsy.

DE ANIMAL WELFARE; BEHAVIOR; PEN DESIGN; SOWS
AB Ninety-six pregnant sows, previously penned in individual stalls, were housed in groups of four in pens containing three zones: a) four individual feeding stalls without rear gates, b) a communal sleeping kennel and c) a dunging area between the stalls and kennel. The fee,ding stalls were either long (2m) or short (1m) with barriers made of wire mesh. The daily allowance of 2.5kg pelleted feed per sow was presented either all at once (dump) or at the rate of approximately 100g/min by a manual system (trickle). Dung disposal systems were either a pit filled with sawdust-based compost, a slatted floor, or straw on a sloped concrete floor. There were two replicates of the 2x2x3 factorial design. The location of sows was observed from time-lapse video recordings taken at regular intervals throughout the 31 day experimental period.
   Use of the three zones of the pens was influenced by feeding method, barrier length and dung disposal system. Overall the feeding stalls were used more with trickle than with dump feeding (P<0.05); more with long than with short barriers (P<0.001), and most with slatted floors and least with the straw system (P<0.001). All these treatments had the opposite effects on the use of the communal kennel. The use of the dunging area was not affected by feeding method or stall length but was greater (P<0.01) on the compost compared with the other two dung disposal systems. Throughout the experimental period the use of feeding stalls decreased (P<0.001). Circadian use of the pen zones interacted with barrier length and dung disposal system. Kennels were used most at night in pens with straw, exceeding 54min/h with half length (1m) stalls. The lowest night-time use of kennels, around 8min/h, was found in pens with full length (2m) stalls combined with either compost or slats. Ambient temperature did not have a major influence on use of pen zones.
   The occupation of stalls, especially full length stalls, indicates that offering a choice between solitary and communal areas may improve the welfare of group-housed sows.

AB Ambulatory blood pressure measurements were performed in 8 patients with normotensive pregnancy by means of an oscillometric ABPM monitor (Spacelab 90207) to investigate trime-non-specific differences in 24-hour blood pressure profiles. All patients showed a significant decline of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) throughout pregnancy. Circadian rhythm was prevailed in all the pregnants investigated, i. e. they showed a nocturnal decrease or dipping of blood pressure of more than 10% as compared with daily BR 24-hour BP was lowest in the second trimenon due to a significant fall in night BP in comparison with the first and third trimenon (p <0.01). Diastolic BP that initially declined in the first trimenon constantly increased to reach normal values in the third trimenon again.

AB Objective. To compare the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and apparent life threatening event (ALTE) in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and birth weight-matched control infants in view of the changing pattern of chronic lung disease of prematurity.
   Methods. The study population consisted of 78 preterm infants of 26 to 33 weeks gestation who were diagnosed as having BPD and discharged. The 78 control infants were matched with the study infants for birth weight categories. Infants unable to maintain adequate oxygenation without supplemental oxygen when they were feeding well and thriving were discharged on home oxygen. All infants were at least 8 months of age at follow-up and information concerning the occurrence of any ALTE was obtained by direct parent interview.
   Results. No infant died during the period of followup. Seven (8.9%) of the study group compared with eight (10.5%) of the control infants had an ALTE. Three infants (one study, two control infants) were hospitalized for further investigation. No infant discharged on the home oxygen program had an ALTE.
   Conclusions. The data from this study suggest that preterm infants with BPD are not at increased risk from SIDS compared with preterm infants without this condition. This may be related to close monitoring of the infants' oxygenation status and the provision of home oxygen when appropriate, which should eliminate episodes of unrecognized and untreated hypoxemia. Home monitoring for infants with BPD may not be warranted.

AB Objective. To investigate the effect of prenatal smoking on infant respiratory behavior during sleep.
   Methods. A questionnaire concerning family habits and infants' history was completed for 550 healthy infants before a 9-hour night polysomnographic study. Because the data for 41 infants were not available for analysis, 509 subjects were studied: 115 were newborns evaluated within 1 week after birth, and 394 were healthy infants admitted at 11 weeks of life (range 5 to 29 weeks) after various research protocols.
   Results. According to the smoking frequency of the mothers during pregnancy, the subjects were defined as ''nonsmokers'' (no cigarette smoked during pregnancy; n = 400), ''light smokers'' (1 to 9 cigarettes per day; n = 37), or ''smokers'' (10 or more cigarettes per day; n = 72). Compared with nonsmokers and light smokers, ''smoking'' mothers had a significant increase in the number of episodes of uterine bleeding during the pregnancy. Their infants had lower birth weights and more frequent episodes of profuse sweating during sleep. Infants of smokers also had more frequent and longer obstructive sleep apneas than those of the two other groups. For infants of smokers the relative risk for obstructive apneas was 2.76 (95% confidence interval: 1.63 to 4.69; P =.001) The relation between prenatal smoking and postnatal manifestation of obstructive sleep apneas demonstrated a dose-response pattern. Paternal smoking during pregnancy increased the risk of obstructive apneas only in the infants of smoking mothers, but not in those of the two other groups. Maternal smoking after birth did not add significantly to the risk of obstructive apneas. The effect of smoking was seen in older infants, as well as in the newborns not yet exposed to ambient cigarette smoke. A stepwise logistic regression, using obstructive sleep apneas as the dependent variable identified three significant independent variables: smoking during pregnancy (P =.001), profuse sweating during sleep (P =.001), and birth weight (P = .010). No explanation was found for the effect of prenatal smoking on obstructive sleep apneas.
   Conclusion. Prenatal smoking by mothers correlated with an increase in frequency and length of obstructive apneas and a decrease in birth weight of their infants. The infants were under greater risk for obstructive apnea if both parents smoked. Explanations for our results are unknown to us, but these findings may be of interest in the study of infant breathing behavior and epidemiological characteristics of sudden infant death syndrome.

AB To assess the influence of intrauterine growth retardation on heart rate (HR) and HR variability during sleep, we performed polygraphic recordings in 10 small-for-gestational age (SGA) and 16 appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) newborns. Both groups were clinically and neurologically normal and were at 37 to 41 wk conceptional age. RR intervals were analyzed using the short-time Fourier transform in three frequency bands: 1) high frequency, with a period 3-8 heartbeat; 2) mid frequency, with a period 10-25 heartbeat; and 3) low frequency, with a period 30-100 heartbeat. In both active and quiet sleep, SGA newborns significantly differed from AGA newborns by having a shorter RR interval(p < 0.01) and lower amplitude of HR variability in all bands (p < 0.05) except low frequency in quiet sleep. Quiet sleep differed from active sleep by having a longer RR interval (p < 0.05), higher high-frequency variability (p < 0.02) in both SGA and AGA newborns, and lower low-frequency variability (p < 0.005 for AGA newborns). Our data give evidence of clear modifications of both sympathetic and parasympathetic HR control in the at-risk SGA population. Similarity of between-state characteristics suggests maintained CNS control of HR in SGA as well as in AGA newborns. We speculate that between-group HR and HR variability differences may be related to augmented metabolic rate in SGA compared with AGA newborns.

AB In Rwanda, a central African country, the prevalence of HIV infection now exceeds 30% in urban adults.  This study identifies the social services and counseling needs of women who are already infected with the HIV virus, the outcome after disclosure of the women's HIV test result to her partner and estimates the social support available to the women from their partners and relatives.
   Fifty-five HIV-positive women in Kigali were interviewed in 1988 and 47 of this group were interviewed again in 1991.  The social services most needed by the women in 1988 were housing, employment and money.  By 1991, the women prioritised food, housing and money as their current needs and food, childcare and money were their future needs in the event they became ill.  The preferred sources of support in 1988 were individual counseling and women's support groups.  By 1991, the preferred sources of support were individual counseling and their priest.
   In 1988, almost 75% of the women did not expect a supportive reaction from their partners after disclosure of the test result.  In 1991, acceptance, understanding and sympathy were the most common reactions of the partners after disclosure.  However, 8 (21%) had not told their partner their test result.  After disclosure, 18 of the 37 partners were subsequently tested.  Of those tested, 75% were HIV-positive and 25% were HIV-negative.  Condom use was almost twice as high when the partner was informed of the test result, although in couples overall, a third were not using condoms despite knowing the test result.  There were 23 births since 1988 and pregnancy was equally likely whether the test result was known or if the partner tested.  The women overall reported good morale in 1991, bolstered by their religion.  Chronic difficulties with sleep, performing daily routine and feelings of depression were reported by a third of women.
   Conclusions are that basic survival services are needed for affected families, and a program of testing and counseling for partners is required.

AB Spontaneous breathing movements are present during fetal life and they are important for normal development of the lung. Early in gestation they seem to represent free-running activity of the respiratory centers, not controlled by peripheral mechanisms but probably dependent on a tonic CO2 drive. Maturation of sleep states brings into play powerful brainstem inhibitory mechanisms which control FBM. At birth these mechanisms must be overridden to allow the establishment of continuous breathing.

AB Objectives To establish the reproducibility of flow velocity waveforms in the human ductus venosus and to assess the influence of fetal behavioural states on these waveforms in normal term fetuses.
   Design Reproducibility of Doppler waveform recording and analysis was studied in 10 normal pregnancies. The relation between ductus venosus flow velocities and behavioural states was investigated in 19 other term fetuses. Time-averaged, peak systolic, peak diastolic velocity, peak systolic/diastolic ratio and period time were calculated in both cross sectional studies.
   Setting Outpatient clinic, department of obstetrics (prenatal diagnosis section), Academic Hospital, Rotterdam-Dijkzigt.
   Subjects Twenty-nine women with normal singleton pregnancies at 36 to 39 weeks of gestation, resulting in uncomplicated births of healthy infants.
   Results Within-patient coefficients of variation, ductus venosus waveform recordings were approximately 8 to 10% except for the peak systolic/diastolic ratio (4.3%). A decrease of approximately 30% was established for peak systolic, peak diastolic velocity and time-averaged velocity during behavioural state 1F (quiet sleep) as compared with state 2F (active sleep).
   Conclusions Flow velocity waveform recording in the ductus venosus demonstrates acceptable reproducibility. Fetal behavioural state-dependent changes were observed, suggesting a redistribution of umbilical venous blood through the ductus venosus shunt during the quiet sleep state.

AB Excitatory amino acid neurotransmission is an essential component of the neuroendocrine transmission line that regulates anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion. Excitatory amino acids (EAAs), such as glutamate and aspartate, are found in large concentrations in presynaptic boutons of a variety of important hypothalamic nuclei, including the arcuate nucleus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus, and the preoptic area. EAA receptors can be divided into two broad groups, namely, ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic receptors are subdivided into NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), kainate, and AMPA (DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors. Their main mode of action is by the modulation of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ ion channels. Metabotropic receptors, on the other hand, act by a G-protein-stimulated release of intracellular Ca2+ or modulation of adenylate cyclase activity. The different EAA receptor subtypes are found in a variety of areas of the hypothalamus and the brain. In a variety of species, the administration of glutamate, NMDA, or kainate leads to LH release mediated through the stimulation of hypothalamic gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GnRH) release.
   The major site of NMDA action appears to be the preoptic area-where GnRH cell bodies reside. AMPA and kainate appear to act primarily at the arcuate nucleus/median eminence, the site of GnRH nerve terminals. NMDA may also act upon noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus to influence hypothalamic GnRH release. The steroid-induced LH surge in ovariectomized animals and the preovulatory surge of LH in cycling animals and in pregnant mare's serum gonadotropic-primed animals are blocked by the NMDA antagonist MK801 and the AMPA/kainate antagonist DNQX. MK801 also suppressed FSH surges in most instances, whereas DNQX had no effect on FSH surges. In the ovariectomized female rat, both the NMDA antagonist AP5 and the AMPA/kainate antagonist DNQX, lowered mean LH levels, LH pulse amplitude, and LH pulse frequency. Activation of NMDA receptors advanced the time of vaginal opening in the immature female rat, while kainate and DNQX were without effect. Gonadal steroid removal (castration) did not alter NMDA receptor levels or affinity in the hypothalamus of female or male rats. Likewise, steroid replacement to castrate rats did not affect hypothalamic NMDA receptor levels or NMDA R(1) mRNA levels. Similarly, NMDA and kainate receptor levels in the hypothalamus did not change during the time of puberty in the female rat.
   In contrast, AMPA receptor (GluR(1)) immunoreactive levels in the magnocellular preoptic area (mPOA), the arcuate nucleus (ARC), and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) were found to be markedly elevated during the time of the LH surge in estradiol-progesterone-treated castrate rats compared to those of the vehicle-only-treated castrate rat. The release rates of glutamate and aspartate in the POA were found to be significantly elevated during the steroid-induced LH surge in the ovariectomized adult rat. Hence, the induction of the LH surge by steroids may involve enhanced EAA neurotransmission mediated by steroid-induced elevations in the release of glutamate and aspartate in the POA and AMPA receptors in the POA, the ARC, and the SCN. Evidence also exists supporting a role of EAAs in the release of other pituitary hormones, such as prolactin, ACTH, growth hormone, oxytocin, and vasopressin, as well as circadian rhythm induction and regulation. The above evidence points to a pivotal role of EAAs acting at the level of the hypothalamus in the neuroendocrine regulation of a variety of hormonal systems with the largest amount of data available on the control of gonadotropin secretion.

AB Although sleep disturbance is commonly reported in pregnancy, there have been few studies on sleep characteristics in pregnancy. In this study, all women attending the antenatal clinic at Sapporo Medical CoIlege Hospital for 1 month during autumn and 3 months during winter were surveyed with a questionnaire and sleep log. Of the 192 patients, 169 (88.0%) stated that sleep was altered from their usual experience. A principal components analysis identified three sleep factors from the ten items in the measure of sleep used (Sleep Log). The three factors were: Sleep Duration and Quality, Insomnia and Daytime Alertness. Although no significant differences across trimesters were found on the three sleep factors, Sleep Duration and Quality, and Insomnia were worst during the first trimester. Sleep normalized in the second trimester, but the third trimester was characterized by increased Insomnia and decreased Daytime Alertness. The most frequent reasons cited by women for sleep alterations were urinary frequency, backache or ache in the hips and fetal movement. Contingency chi2 analyses were used to investigate a relationship between the frequency of reporting the reasons and the trimester of pregnancy. Significant increases were found in reporting as the reasons for sleep difficulties, fetal movement in the third trimester, and heartburn, nausea and vomiting in the first trimester. The description of sleep patterns during pregnancy has clinical relevance as sleep alterations in pregnancy are common.

AB This paper offers an empirical mathematical formula (geometric series) for the ages at which ''events'' can occur in organisms. These ''events'' include fertilization, events in the fertilized ovum, developmental events in the embryo and fetus, birth, mating, and other postnatal events throughout the remainder of life.
   A theory is presented for the foregoing timing of events by the building of an mRNA molecule one unit at a time. The formula is derived from the hypothetical molecule-building process.
   It is shown that the majority of species have ranges of gestation ages that are indicative of subspecies using several successive event ages from the formula. On a time scale of evolution, these subspecies march randomly toward higher event ages, which is the process of heterochrony.

AB Objective: To review current knowledge of the efficacy, safety and cost of transdermal nicotine therapy for smoking cessation.
   Data sources and study selection: 1. Published and unpublished reports of randomised, double-blind trials of at least 12 weeks' duration, in smokers motivated to cease smoking, identified by a search of the MEDLINE database, article and book bibliographies, Current contents, and by a request to the Medical Department of Ciba-Geigy (Australia) Ltd. 2. A clinical trial of 1500 smokers using transdermal nicotine (S Gourlay, unpublished data).
   Data synthesis: Transdermal nicotine more than doubles the success rates of smoking cessation attempts in motivated subjects who smoke at least 10-15 cigarettes per day (odds ratio 12 months after quitting, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-3.4). Application site reactions are not uncommon (erythema or burning less than or equal to 16%, transient itch less than or equal to 50%) and cause discontinuation of therapy in up to 10% of subjects. Sleep disturbance due to nocturnal nicotine absorption occurs in up to 13% of subjects when patches are worn overnight. Smoking or nicotine chewing gum used concurrently with transdermal nicotine could raise peak nicotine levels but is unlikely to adversely affect individuals with established tolerance to nicotine. Smoking and (theoretically) nicotine replacement therapies should be avoided in pregnancy or patients with unstable coronary artery disease. In such patients, the risk-benefit ratio of nicotine replacement therapies may be favourable for nicotine-dependent smokers unable to cease smoking by alternative methods.
   Conclusions: Transdermal nicotine is an effective smoking cessation therapy for motivated, nicotine-dependent smokers. As most smokers can cease smoking on their own, and the patches are costly, they should be recommended only for smokers who are unable to quit by simpler means and those likely to suffer severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

AB The present review is devoted to effects on the newborn of maternal ingestion of caffeine during gestation and lactation. In rodents, caffeine is able to induce malformations, but usually at high doses never encountered in humans; indeed, when caffeine is administered in fractioned quantities during the day, as it is the case with human caffeine intake, caffeine is no longer a teratogen in rodents. Caffeine ingested during gestation induces a dose-dependent decrease in body weight, but only for large doses (>7 cups/day of coffee), whereas it has no effect at moderate doses. Maternal caffeine consumption during gestation affects hematologic parameters in both rat and human infants and induces long-term effects on sleep, locomotion, learning abilities, emotivity and anxiety in rodent offspring, whereas in humans, more studies are needed to determine the consequences of early caffeine exposure on behavior. Investigators do not agree on the quantities of the methylxanthine found in breast milk,but caffeine does not change breast milk composition, and rather, stimulates milk production. We conclude in this review that maternal caffeine consumption in moderate amounts during gestation and lactation has no measurable consequences on the fetus and newborn infant. Pregnant mothers, however, should be advised to consume coffee and caffeinated beverages in moderation, especially because of the prolonged half-life of caffeine both during the last trimester of pregnancy and in the newborn infant.

AB The internal gestation and subsequent lactation of mammalian reproduction represent a considerable physiological challenge. The extent of disruption in the daily rhythm of four parameters, core body temperature, nest attendance, activity, and wheel running, was monitored in Djungarian hamster (Phodopus campbelli) and Siberian hamster (P. sungorus) females implanted intraperitoneally with biotelemetric thermistors. The amplitude of each rhythm decreased during late gestation, culminating in a substantial disruption at parturition, and did not begin a recovery until the latter third of lactation. In each species, the change in the core body temperature rhythm was primarily the result of an elevation in light phase body temperature to approximate the normally occurring dark phase temperature, although the disruption was more extensive in P. sungorus than in P. campbelli. As this maternal hyperthermia is associated with the provision of essential heat to the altricial litter, these species differences in the vulnerability to hyperthermia may constrain the reproductive success these extreme cold adapted small mammals.

AB Differences in state-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral values are described between groups of preterm and full-term neonates at comparable postconceptional term ages. Eighteen healthy preterm neonates of less-than-or-equal-to 32 weeks gestation were selected from an inborn population of a neonatal intensive care unit. Twenty-four-channel recordings were obtained at a full-term age and compared with studies of 22 healthy full-term neonates. The initial three hours of each 12-hour study were recorded on paper from which EEG sleep state scores per minute were visually assessed. Six mean spectral values (i.e. total EEG, electromyogram, delta, theta, alpha and beta energies) were calculated from each corresponding minute of digitized data, which was also assigned one of six EEG sleep states. Each neonatal group displayed statistically significant differences among sleep-state segments for all spectral values. The alpha- and beta-range spectral values of the preterm group, compared to the full-term control group, were lower during all sleep state segments. Spectral values for the theta band were lower during both quiet sleep segments only, whereas spectral values for delta were lower during all sleep stages, except trace-alternant quiet sleep. Significant differences in EEG spectral values were noted among states of sleep for both preterm and full-term infants of similar postconceptional term ages. These data also suggest differences in central nervous system maturation between neonatal populations. These findings strengthen our previously stated contention that there is a functional alteration in brain development of the preterm infant as reflected in sleep organization that results from a prolonged extrauterine experience and/or prematurity.

AB Immunoreactivity, cytochemical, immunocytochemical characteristics and subcellular distribution of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) were investigated in blood and/or smear samples from 18 women aged 23-46 years (mean 32.5 years) with trisomy 21 fetuses (17-21 weeks) and 28 women aged 20-42 years (mean 31 years) with normal fetuses (17-22 weeks). Immunochemical NAP investigations were carried out in 8 pathological and 8 normal pregnancies; cytochemical and immunocytochemical procedures were carried out in 18 pregnant women with trisomy 21 fetuses and 28 controls. NAP from women with trisomy 21 fetuses is characterized by: (1) a significant decrease in reactivity with anti-liver-type alkaline phosphatase (AP) and anti-NAP antisera; (2) low or very slight reactivity with antiplacental or anti-intestinal antibodies; (3) marked dispersion of NAP lead citrate reaction products or anti-NAP antibody colloidal gold-labelling in neutrophil cytoplasms, as detected by electron microscopy. This subcellular AP distribution (extramembranous) is different from that of normal NAP sites associated with plasma membrane, nuclear membrane and secretory vesicles. The NAP immunochemical and cytochemical characteristics suggest that neutrophils of a woman with a trisomy 21 fetus contain two AP isoenzymes: the liver/bone type and an atypical AP.

ID SUDDEN-INFANT-DEATH; SLEEPING POSITION; PASSIVE SMOKING; EXPOSURE
AB We have analyzed the levels of nicotine and cotinine in pericardial fluid in 24 consecutively autopsied cases of sudden unexpected death in infants aged one to six months. Our aim was to determine to what extent victims of sudden infant death may have been exposed to passive smoking near the time of death. Sixteen of the decreased infants were classified as SIDS at autopsy. Other contributing causes of death, predominantly infections, were found in eight cases. Eight infants (30%) had cotinine levels less than 2 ng, indicating that no significant exposure to nicotine had occurred near the time of death. Of the remaining 70%, five had been moderately exposed, seven markedly exposed and four heavily exposed (cotinine levels 2-10 ng, 10-50 ng and more than 50 ng, respectively). Since only 18% of Swedish women smoke after childbearing we conclude that nicotine exposure in infants who died suddenly was much higher than one would otherwise expect. It is hypothesized that high concentrations of nicotine and nicotine metabolites around the heart may affect cardiac function and thus play a role in the mechanisms causing SIDS or other categories of sudden unexpected death.

AB The effects of adenosine on plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations were determined in chronically catheterized fetal sheep (>0.8 term). Infusion of adenosine [0.35 +/- 0.01 (SE) mg.min(-1).kg(-1)] into the inferior vena cava of six fetuses caused a transient fall in arterial PO2 (by similar to 3 Torr), a slight reduction in arterial pH, and a 5- to 6-mmHg decrease in diastolic pressure without significantly affecting systolic or mean arterial values. A lower rate of infusion (0.19 +/- 0.01 mg.min(-1).kg(-1)) in five fetuses had virtually no effect on arterial blood gases, pH, or arterial pressures. Both the low- and high-dose adenosine infusions significantly increased fetal plasma AVP concentrations (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 25 +/- 7 pg/ml and 1.6 +/- 0.1 to 54 +/- 8 pg/ml, respectively). Intravenous infusion of papaverine lowered fetal diastolic and mean arterial pressures by similar to 8 mmHg but had no significant effect on plasma levels of AVP. During an hour of isocapnic hypoxia (arterial PO2 12-13 Torr), fetal plasma AVP levels increased from 1.7 +/- 0.2 to 40 +/- 6 pg/ml. Intra-arterial infusion of the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-(p-sulfophenyl)-heophylline significantly blunted the hypoxia-induced rise in plasma AVP concentrations to a maximum mean level of 11 +/- 6 pg/ml. These results indicate that 1) adenosine causes a dose-dependent increase in plasma AVP concentrations and 2) a hypoxia-induced rise in fetal adenosine levels triggers vasopressin release.

AB The developmental toxicity of pineal hormones on mouse embryos was examined both in vitro and in vivo. Pregnant ICR mice were divided into groups which received at 1.5 days post-coitum (p.c.) and again at 2.5 days p.c. a subcutaneous injection of one of the following pineal indoles: hydroxyindoleacetic acid (HIAA), melatonin (MEL), methoxytryptophol (MTP) or methoxytryptamine (MTA). Mice treated with the injection vehicle served as the control. The animals were sacrificed at 17.5 days p.c. The pineal indole treatment did not cause changes in the gravid uterine weight, numbers of implants, early resorption, late resorption, dead fetuses and live fetuses, fetal weight or fetal crown-rump length, and did not produce embryos with external or visceral defects. However, some mice treated with MTP or MTA produced litters in which all embryos underwent resorption.
   Cultured embryos at the 4-cell stage were treated with the aforementioned pineal indoles and examined after 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. It was found that MTA retarded embryonic development at all time points studied. HIAA also produced a slight inhibitory effect on embryonic development. Some embryos underwent degeneration in response to the MTA and HIAA treatments. However, MEL- and MTP-treated embryos were in general developmentally similar to control embryos. When cultured embryos were treated at the 8-cell to compacting stage, it was found that MTA exerted only a slight retarding effect on embryonic development, while other indoles were devoid of any conspicuous effects.

AB Epidemiologic risk factors for sudden unexpected infant deaths (SID) between the 8th and 730th day of life were investigated in two German districts (53 000 births per year) between 1990 to 1992. 175 cases (69% of the official statistical figures) were included 97% had a Postmortem examination, all involved families had an interview. Control data were taken from a perinatal inquiry (n = 92 062), a mail survey of the Ministry of Health (Bundesgesundheitsamt) (n = 760), and official statistics (n = 834 38 1) of the same area.
   Situational characteristics: prone position (Odds-Ratio 9.7), head under bedclothes (OR 20. 1), profuse sweating (OR 13.9).. Sociodemographic features: mother < 18 years (OR 4.2), father unemployed (OR 2.1), >3 children (3.2), low educational level of the mother (2.6). Pre-/perinatal factors: <5 examinations during pregnancy (OR 3.3), multiple birth (4.2), birthweight < 3000 g (OR 1.9), prematurity (OR 1.9), smoking during pregnancy (OR 5.4, >9 cigarettes 11.7). Low birthweight was only a risk factor in combination with smoking. Postnatal factors: prone spleeping position (OR 6.1), breast feeding <3 months (OR 6.3), smoking (3.3).
   Since they could be modified, their odds-ratio and prevalence the risk factors smoking, bottle feeding and prone sleeping position are the most promising for a preventive campaign in Germany.

TI A PROSPECTIVE-STUDY IN A SOUTHERN INDIAN HOSPITAL ON THE PRESCRIPTION OF
   MEDICATION DURING THE LYING IN PERIOD FOLLOWING CHILDBIRTH
SO SOZIAL-UND PRAVENTIVMEDIZIN
LA English
DT Article
AB The awareness of the inherent risks attached to medication use during pregnancy is increasing.  There is, however, a paucity of available following childbirth.  We have conducted a prospective study in women who gave birth in hospital with the objective of analysing the use of medication in this lying in period.  The results show that, in addition to the vitamins and minerals routinely prescribed for every young mother and the antipyretics administered as required, the following medicaments were most often used:  analgesics (by approx. 9%), antiflammatory agents (49%) and antibiotics (38%).  The antibiotics were either used prophylactically or, in cases of proven infection, administered therapeutically.  The use of antibiotics appears more intensive compared to western countries, presumably due to the greater risk of infection in this group in India.  On the other hand, the use of sleep inducing medication and tranquillizers during the lying in period appears, in comparison to other studies, almost negligable.  The majority of the women were unaware of the potential side-effects of medication during breastfeeding.

AB While the number of mothers resuming employment soon after the birth of a child is growing, knowledge about the effect that having both a baby and a job has on mental and physical health is still scarce.
   In this paper, we studied the health of 141 Italian first-time mothers, who were all employed during pregnancy. When their child was 15 months old, 84% were back at work; 24-36% suffered from lack of sleep, extreme tiredness and backache; more than half had experienced some feelings of depression since the birth. Considering the whole sample, poorly educated and unmarried mothers reported more physical health problems. Being employed per se showed no influence, but poorly educated mothers and those with a less qualified job reported more problems.
   On the basis of our results, we suggest that future research on new mothers, work and health should systematically include ''domestic'' variables and the characteristics of the paid job; and should analyze more thoroughly the influence of marriage status and educational level on health.

SO ZOO BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE BEHAVIOR; REINTRODUCTION
AB Daytime activity patterns of captive giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) (n = 21) were observed for 2 week periods during October 1991 and January, April, and July 1992- A daytime bimodal activity pattern was seen with increased activity coinciding with feeding times at 1000 and 1600 h. The animals spent an average of 40 +/- 10% of their time sleeping, 21 +/- 10% resting, 25 +/- 11% eating, 13 +/- 9% walking, and 1 +/- 3% interacting with other giant pandas. Adult females were less active than males or juveniles. During July, giant pandas were less active during the daytime than during other seasons of the year. There was no difference in activity patterns between pregnant and non-pregnant females. Two infants had similar activity patterns to the adults by the time they were 6 months old.
   Comparison with wild giant pandas (n = 5) at the Wolong Nature Reserve revealed similar bimodal activity cycles, although the time of peak activity differed and foraging/feeding time was greater for wild pandas than for captive animals. (C) 1994 Wiley Liss, Inc.

AB Few studies regarding the effects of ozone exposure in the central nervous system (CNS), during the early stages of development have been reported. The study of sleep on newborn rats represents a model to understand the effects of this gas on the CNS. We studied the sleep organization in rats whose mothers were exposed to 1 part per million (ppm) ozone during pregnancy. We found severe sleep disturbances such as a decrease in paradoxical sleep duration and inversion of the light-dark cycle or a circadian phase-shift of vigilance slates. These results suggest that ozone exposure during pregnancy may affect the generating mechanisms of paradoxical sleep, and the regulation of circadian rhythms in rats.

AB The development of the retinohypothalamic tract (PI-IT) in the albino rat and golden hamster was studied using anterograde transport of cholera toxin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (CT-HRP). The RHT has three components in the adult: (1) a dense projection to the ventrolateral subdivision of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) with some fibers extending into the dorsomedial SCN; (2) a projection to adjacent areas, the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) and retrochiasmatic area (RCA) and in the hamster, into the preoptic area (POA); (3) a projection to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). In the rat, the projection to the SCN and adjacent areas first appears as scattered Varicosities at the ventral border of the SCN at postnatal day 1 (Pi) and gradually increases until the adult pattern is achieved at approximately P10. The projections to the AHA and RCA are seen first at P2-P3 and gradually increase to the adult appearance by P15. Both the projection to the SCN and adjacent areas and to the LHA, initially are more extensive than in the adult. Many of the axons extend well beyond the zone of the adult pattern but these anomalous fibers are eliminated by P6-P10. The LHA projection first appears at embryonic day 21-22 (E 21-22) and gradually increases in density from P1-P6. In the hamster the projections to the SCN, AHA and LHA appear first on P4 and gradually increase in density to reach the adult pattern by P15. The projections to the RCA and POA are present by P6 and reach the adult pattern by P15. None of the RHT projections in the hamster has the initial extended growth followed by pruning back that characterizes RHT development in the rat. Thus, the development of the RHT in both the rat and the hamster is complex with components of the projection appearing at different times with differing patterns of development that indicate specialized interactions of the developing axons with their target neurons. Synaptogenesis in the hamster hypothalamus was analyzed using an antiserum to synapsin I. Few synapses are present at E16, the last day of gestation, in the LHA, SCN and AHA. From P1-P3, synaptogenesis proceeds rapidly and the adult pattern is achieved in all three areas by P4.

AB Circadian rhythms are present during fetal life in several mammalian species. To characterize the ontogeny of the neural mechanisms that account for circadian rhythmicity in a precocious species, we studied the prenatal development of the retinohypothalamic pathway in lambs (gestation period of 147 days), using horseradish peroxidase and wheat germ agglutinin as anterograde tracers. The suprachiasmatic nucleus was present as early as embryonic day 52 (E52). After E58, the suprachiasmatic nucleus reached its full number of neurons, estimated by the disector method in about 160,000 cells per nucleus at E62. The retinohypothalamic axons invaded the suprachiasmatic nucleus from E58, while neuroblasts were still migrating to the nucleus. At E62, there was a strong retinal projection that evolved until E121, when the retinal afferents established their definitive pattern of distribution in the ventral and central regions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and adjacent hypothalamic structures. The development of the retinohypothalamic pathway was delayed by about a week relative to the innervation of other subcortical visual centers.
   The present findings demonstrated an early prenatal development of the visual pathways in lambs, including the retinohypothalamic pathway, suggesting that the mechanisms for the visual entrainment of circadian rhythms in lambs may be functioning several weeks before birth.

AB The peripheral chemoresponses of infant twin pairs were determined using a single-breath hyperoxic stimulus. A total of 43 twin pairs of comparable gestation and birth weight were studied during sleep at a mean (SD) age of 8 wk (1.4) while alternately breathing either air or 16% oxygen in nitrogen. Infants responded to a single breath of 100% oxygen by a reduction in ventilation; the mean (SEM) reduction in air was 273 ml/min (10.6) and in 16% oxygen 560 ml/min (18.4). Within-pair variances were compared in 14 monozygotic and 28 dizygotic pairs utilizing combined responses (air + 16% oxygen) computed for measurements made in behavioral quiet sleep and in 9 monozygotic and 20 dizygotic pairs for whom data were complete in polygraphically confirmed quiet sleep. The variance of responses within dizygotic twin pairs was greater than in monozygotic pairs when expressed in ml/min: F ratio 4.11 (p = 0.005) for all data and F ratio 7.67 (p = 0.003) in quiet sleep. Expressed in ml/min/kg the difference was less significant: F ratio 1.83 (p = 0.126) for all data and F ratio 3.46 (p = 0.039) in quiet sleep. Gender, birth weight, and birth order had no effect on these findings. This closer similarity of response in monozygotic twin pairs is explained by proposing a high degree of heritability for the response.

AB Twenty-five-day-old rats maintained in constant darkness since birth and born from mothers kept in the dark since the 14th day of pregnancy showed a circadian rhythm of alpha-amylase content in parotid glands, which may be explained by a mechanism of maternal co-ordination. Rats in the same conditions, except that their mothers had been submitted to bilateral excision of the superior cervical ganglia 30 days before mating, did not show diurnal variations of alpha-amylase activity in the parotid glands. When ganglionectomized mothers were treated with a daily dose of melatonin (1 mg/kg) from the 14th day of gestation up to the 10th day of lactation, their litters showed significant diurnal variations of amylase in the parotid glands, suggesting a role of the maternal pineal gland in the maternal-fetal and/or maternal-neonatal transfer of photoperiodic information.

AB The effects of acute and chronic nicotine (N) administration on fetal electrocorticogram (ECoG) were investigated with spectral analysis. Fetal lambs were instrumented surgically to permit unanesthetized ECoG monitoring and N administration. Acute exposure studies used 4-hr constant-rate infusions at 0.6, 3 or 10 mg/hr. Chronic exposure studies used continuous infusions at 1.2 mg/hr for 7 days. The fast Fourier transform and several derivative parameters were used to quantitate the fetal ECoG during both control records and N infusions. Four states were identified and quantitated in the control ECoG: high-voltage slow activity (State 1); low-voltage, fast activity (State IV); and two transitional states of intermediate amplitude and frequency. Acute N infusions elicited changes in the incidence and degree of electrocortical activation that were biphasically dose-related. The 0.6-mg/hr infusion evoked electrocortical activation through an increase in the incidence of State IV. Higher infusion rates elicited progressively less electrocortical activation. The 3-mg/hr infusion affected marginal activation, through a reduction in the incidence of State 1. The 10-mg/hr infusion elicited mixed activation and depression, as assessed by multiple parameter changes. Desensitization of several responses diminished the magnitude of depressive effect observed during the 3- and 10-mg/hr infusions. Chronic nicotine infusions elicited progressive augmentation of electrocortical activation, through increases in the incidence and frequencies of State IV. Tolerance to this activating response was not observed.

AB OBJECTIVE Hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea is associated with disturbances of pulsatile gonadotrophin secretion. The underlying mechanism remains unclear and the aim of this study was to investigate the 24-hour secretory pattern of gonadotrophins in women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea. The effect of opioid blockade using naloxone infusion on LH secretory pattern was also studied.
   DESIGN The secretory patterns of LH, FSH, PRL and their responses to naloxone infusion were studied by serial blood samples collected at 10-minute intervals for 24 hours. On the following day, naloxone was infused at a dose of 1.6 mg per hour for 4 hours.
   PATIENTS Eight women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea, two women hyperprolactinaemic but with normal ovarian cycles, and nine control subjects in the early follicular phase of menstrual cycle.
   MEASUREMENTS Concentrations of LH, FSH and PRL were measured in plasma samples obtained at 10-minute intervals for 24 hours. In one woman, concentrations of urinary oestrone glucuronide were measured daily during treatment with pulsatile GnRH.
   RESULTS The number of LH pulses per 24 hours was significantly fewer in women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea than in those with hyperprolactinaemia with normal cycles or control subjects (mean +/- SEM 4.5 +/- 2.4 vs 13.5 +/- 2.5 vs 17.3 +/- 0.8, P < 0.001). The magnitude of each episode of secretion was significantly higher in the hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoeic women (P < 0.05) so the overall mean concentrations of LH throughout the 24-hour period was similar in the three groups (5 2 +/- 11, 4.8 +/- 0.8 and 5.2 +/- 2.4 U/l respectively). In women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea there was no significant change in the pattern of LH secretion during sleep in contrast to the control women in whom there was a slowing in the LH pulse frequency during the night. There was no significant change in the mean concentrations of LH, FSH and PRL during the naloxone infusion. There were also no significant changes in the LH pulse frequency in response to naloxone infusion when compared with an equivalent period of time in the previous 24 hours. In one hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoeic woman, follicular development, ovulation and pregnancy were induced when gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) was infused in a pulsatile manner at a dose of 5 mug every 90 minutes.
   CONCLUSIONS The suppression of normal ovarian cycles in women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea is due to a significant reduction in frequency of LH (GnRH) secretion which is not due to an increase in hypothalamic opioid activity. As normal ovarian cycles can occur or be induced by exogenous GnRH in hyperprolactinaemia, it is unlikely that a high level of prolactin by itself inhibits follicular development and ovulation.

ID SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB 86 women who suffered from a psychotic disorder for the first time in their life within 6 weeks after parturition,  were investigated regarding sociodemographic and gynaecological parameters, time of onset and initial symptomatology, psychopathological symptoms during hospitalisation, treatment and short-term outcome of the illness. The majority of patients became ill after the first (75 %), full-term normal (63 %) delivery and within the first two postpartum weeks (78 %). The most frequent initial symptoms were anxiety, restlessness, depressive mood, sleep disturbances, behaviour disturbances, catatonic excitement, delusions and hallucinations. By the time of follow-up investigation, 16 women had died; 61 women were investigated on average 25.6 years after onset (minimum 12, maximum 41 years), using standardised instruments of evaluation. Nearly two-thirds of the patients had suffered remanifestation of psychotic disorder during a long-term course (64 %). The frequency of remanifestations of illness after additional pregnancies and deliveries was found to be 1:4, which is also known to be the expected frequency during the course of other psychotic disorders. These results do not justify the global recommendation to avoid additional pregnancies or carry out an interruption of pregnancy, if the patient has a history of postpartum psychosis. The climacteric period also seems to be a vulnerable phase for the remanifestation of illness. Nearly 3/4 of the investigated women displayed no disturbances in any of the evaluated dimensions (psychopathological, psychological, psychosocial status) at the time of follow-up.

AB Although sleep disturbance is commonly reported in pregnancy, there have been surprisingly few studies on the etiology of this condition. Since most hormones show circadian rhythmicity and maintain specific phase relationships with that of the sleep-wake cycle, it was of interest to establish whether sleep disturbances covaried with endocrine changes. This overnight study of pregnant women compared melatonin, cortisol, and prolactin secretion rhythms in six good sleepers and six poor sleepers. The groups were compared by ratios of the areas under the various hormonal curves. Significant differences in the cortisol/melatonin ratio were found between the poor sleeper group (lower values) and the good sleeper group (higher values). Nonsignificant trends, which might be expected to become significant with larger sample sizes, were found for decreased amplitude in the cortisol rhythm and increased amplitude in the melatonin rhythm in poor sleepers. The decreased amplitude of the cortisol rhythm in poor sleepers appeared to be due to a suppression of the early morning (0500-0800) rise. Prolactin levels were high and showed no rhythmicity in both groups. These differences may reflect changes in the circadian pacemaker system of poor sleepers, with increases in melatonin release being a response to counteract poor sleep.

TI 2ND TRIMESTER AMBULATORY BLOOD-PRESSURE IN NULLIPAROUS PREGNANCY - A
   USEFUL SCREENING-TEST FOR PREECLAMPSIA
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INDUCED HYPERTENSION; RESPONSES
AB Objective To assess the effectiveness of second trimester 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement as a screening test for pre-eclampsia.
   Design Prospective interventional study.
   Setting John Radcliffe Maternity Hospital, Oxford, and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London.
   Subjects One hundred and sixty-two normotensive nulliparous women recruited at hospital booking clinics.
   Intervention Ambulatory blood pressure was measured at 18 and 28 weeks gestation using the TM2420 monitor.
   Main outcome measure The development of pre-eclampsia.
   Results Awake systolic and mean arterial pressures were significantly increased (P<0.02) at 18 weeks in those who later developed pre-eclampsia. Those differences were more apparent at 28 weeks at which time the diastolic pressure was also increased (P<0.01). At both stages of gestation the higher readings were sustained during sleep so that the awake-sleep differences were similar in relation to each outcome. The group with incipient pre-eclampsia had a significantly faster heart rate at both 18 and 28 weeks (P< 0.002) The sensitivity in predicting pre-eclampsia for a mean arterial pressure of 85 mmHg or greater at 28 weeks was 65%, with a positive predictive value of 31%. The sensitivity and positive predictive value for a test combining a mean arterial pressure of 85 mmHg or greater and a heart rate of 90 bpm or greater were 53% and 45%, respectively.
   Conclusion Although second trimester ambulatory blood pressure is significantly increased in women who later develop pre-eclampsia, the predictive values for blood pressure alone are low. The efficiency of the test is increased by combining the awake ambulatory heart rate and blood pressure measurement together. If an effective method for preventing, pre-eclampsia becomes available (commencing at 28 weeks gestation), then awake ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate may have some clinical value as a screening test.

AB Objective To investigate the relation between hourly fetal urine production rate (HFUPR) and behavioural states 1F and 2F (corresponding to quiet and active sleep, respectively) in normal near term fetuses.
   Design An observational study.
   Setting A clinic for antenatal care at a university hospital.
   Subjects Nineteen healthy pregnant women examined at 37 to 40 weeks of gestation.
   Main outcome measures Fetal behavioural states (1F and 2F) were assessed by means of fetal heart rate patterns (FHR A and FHR B). Using real time ultrasonography, HFUPR (ml/h) was estimated during behavioural states 1F and 2F.
   Results During behavioural state IF, HFUPR was significantly higher than during state 2F (P<0.01). HFUPR falls by 47% from 50.8 +/- 24.4 ml/h in state IF to 25.7 +/- 15.0 ml/h in state 2F.
   Conclusions During active sleep (state 2F) hourly fetal urine production rate is considerably reduced as compared to quiet sleep (state 1F).

AB Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) completes the diagnostic approach to hypertension of pregnancy, by providing a dynamic study of the blood pressure status of the pregnant woman. It corrects certain erroneous diagnoses of hypertension of pregnancy, in particular those related to the << White coat >> effect, especially common in pregnant women. ABPM enables the study of nocturnal blood pressured figures, known for their prognostic value in hypertension of pregnancy. Finally, while loss or reversal of circadian rhythm appears to be of good predictive value regarding the onset of eclampsia, it is above all blood pressure load which appears to be harmful to fetal growth and maturity. ABPM also facilitates management by improving the compliance of pregnant women with regular monitoring and with treatment, by more accurately guiding the surveillance of drug treatment.

DT Article
AB Radiation doses to the family and general public from I-131 therapy of outpatients were assessed for comparison with the 1990 International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) dose limits. Doses to family members of such patients, measured by previous workers, were converted to show that on average 5.6 +/- 3.7 muSv MBq-1 is received by the spouse and 1.5 +/- 0.87 muSv MBq-1 by other family members. It was deduced that the average dose to the spouse (D muSv MBq-1) when couples sleep apart for T days after administration is given by: D = 2.528 + 3.072e-0.11T if an effective half-life, T(eff), of 6.35 days is used.
   The cumulative effect of repeated treatments should be considered and in view of ALARA it is recommended that couples sleep apart for at least 14 days after each administration, even if this is below limits permitted by authorities.
   The dose to a pregnant colleague or family member other than the wife should be below 2 mSv if the total administered activity is not more than 600 MBq. If the wife is pregnant, couples should sleep apart for at least 30 days after administration.

AB During the last decade we have learned much on physiological changes in the secretion of the pineal hormone melatonin (MLT) in man. Reportedly, there is little or no MLT secreted before age 3 months. Then MLT production commences, becomes circadian, and reaches highest nocturnal levels at the age of 1-3 years. During all of childhood nocturnal peak levels drop progressively by 80 % until adult levels are reached. This alteration appears to be the consequence of increasing body size in face of constant MLT production during childhood. The biological significance of this MLT alteration is presently unknown. Because of conceptual considerations, major depressive syndrome (MDS) and seasonal affective disorder (SAD) have been in the focus of pineal research for several years. Although in these disorders alterations in MLT levels could not be substantiated, light therapy, a consequence of this research, was discovered as an effective treatment for SAD and perhaps for MDS. In addition, there is some recent evidence for low MLT levels in schizophrenia. Finally, the potential effect of MLT in neuroimmunoendocrine interactions is presently explored. Reportedly, in vitro studies and animal experiments give evidence for a modulatory role of MLT in the immune response. However, the exact way of this possible action of MLT remains to be clarified. Clinical studies are too scant for a meaningful estimation of MLT's involvement in human neuroimmunoendocrine interactions.

   ANALYSIS
AB Little is known about the developmental profile of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the developing human brain, despite the potential importance of such information in understanding the pathogenesis of neurological abnormalities or increased risk for the sudden infant death syndrome in offspring exposed to nicotine in utero. In this study, we determined the distribution of [H-3]nicotine binding in the developing human brainstem by quantitative tissue autoradiography. In midgestational fetuses, [H-3]nicotine binding sites were heavily concentrated in tegmental nuclei related to cardiopulmonary integration, arousal, attention, rapid eye movement sleep, and somatic motor control. Over the last half of gestation, [H-3]nicotine binding decreased 60-70% in the tegmental nuclei, with a significant difference in binding between midgestation and early infancy. In contrast, there was essentially no change in [H-3]nicotine binding in the major cerebellar-relay nuclei (principal inferior olive and griseum pontis) between the same time-points. Tritium quenching by increasing lipid (myelin) content in tissue sections did not account for the decreases in [H-3]nicotine binding in tegmental nuclei.
   Based upon the high levels of [H-3]nicotine binding at midgestation, combined with experimental data demonstrating trophic properties for acetylcholine, we postulate that nAChRs play a role in the development of the brainstem tegmentum during this period, and that once this role is fulfilled, nicotinic cholinergic binding decreases and remains low thereafter. Alternatively, nicotinic cholinergic receptors may be critical for other developmentally related functions and/or neurotransmission in the brainstem tegmentum at midgestation. The high levels of [H-3]nicotine binding in the brainstem tegmentum at midgestation and its rapidly changing profile over late gestation further suggest that mid-to-late gestation is a developmental period during which this region is likely to be most vulnerable to the harmful effects of nicotine in maternal cigarette smoke. The baseline information provided in this study is potentially relevant towards understanding attention deficits and risk for the sudden infant death syndrome in offspring exposed to cigarette smoke in utero.

AB Chronically prepared near-term fetal lambs (129-133 days gestation) were exteriorized into a saline bath under maternal spinal anesthesia, and each head was rigidly connected to a stereotaxic frame. Multibarrel glass electrodes were inserted into the region of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) during fetal breathing (FB) in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Of a total of 223 neurons, it was possible to record only 6 neurons for which firing amplitude did not change during the transition from REM to non-REM (NREM) sleep. The burst frequency, number of spikes per breath, and association with diaphragmatic activity were variable, with phasic activity preceding FB or disappearing and reappearing during FB. During the transition from REM to NREM sleep, phasic neuronal activity ceased, became tonic, and finally ceased altogether. L-Glutamate increased the number of spikes per breath and caused previous phasic activity to reappear but in NREM sleep produced only tonic activity. We conclude that during REM sleep the fetal respiratory neurons in the region of the NTS are to a large degree influenced by nonrespiratory REM sleep factors and that quiescence of respiratory neurons during NREM sleep is due to the lack of phasic input rather than to direct inhibition. Inhibition of FB during NREM sleep must occur upstream of the NTS neuron.

AB In Syrian hamsters, the circadian timing system is sensitive to melatonin during gestation but is not responsive in the adult. In order to further understand this developmental change in melatonin responsiveness, in vitro autoradiography was used to assess the presence of specific 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin binding sites in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of female hamsters of selected embryonic (E) and postnatal (PN) ages (e.g. E13, E14, E15, PN1, PN2, PN12, PN25, PN112-133). Specific 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin binding sites were seen in the Suprachiasmatic nuclei of some of the E14 hamsters and all the perinatal hamsters (E15, PN1 and PN2) but not in older hamsters. In contrast, specific 2-[I-l25]iodomelatonin binding sites were seen in the pars tuberalis of all hamsters (with the exception of one), regardless of age. The transient expression of specific 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin binding sites in the suprachiasmatic nuclei suggests that melatonin may have some special functions restricted to early development. The specific 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin binding sites in the embryonic suprachiasmatic nuclei may represent the substrate for maternal melatonin to set the phase of the developing circadian timing system.

AB To assess if cocaine alters cerebral glucose metabolism in the fetus, we infused cocaine 0.6 mg/min intravenously to 6 of 13 fetal sheep for the 55 min prior to measurement of glucose utilization by an autoradiographic method. Overall, local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was lower in cocaine-exposed fetuses than in 7 controls (P = 0.058). In the cocaine-exposed fetuses, 33 of 34 structures had lower mean LCGU than in the comparable structures of control fetuses. In addition, the autoradiographs in 4 of 6 cocaine-exposed fetuses revealed thin, dark lines of increased glucose utilization within the central white matter of some frontal gyri which were not seen in any of the 7 control fetuses. These lines were distributed similarly to ones seen earlier in severely hypoxic newborn lambs. In fetal lambs, cocaine resulted in a generalized decrease in LCGU and a specific increase in glucose utilization in parts of cortical white matter of the frontal gyri, possibly secondary to local ischemia.

   ENVIRONMENT; FETUS
AB Many pregnant women are exposed to low frequency sounds and vibrations while at work or play. How the fetus is affected by these physical stimuli is not clearly documented. We recorded behavioral state and intrauterine sound pressure levels in eight fetal sheep previously instrumented with electrocortical, electroocular and neck electromyographic leads, and with a miniature hydrophone. Data were collected before, during and after 30 min of abdominal vibration using a belt vibrator commonly used by humans in weight reduction programs. A sudden shift in behavioral state occurred at the onset of vibration. There was a decrease in non-rapid eye movement sleep (P<0.02) and an increase in time during which the sleep state could not be determined (P<0.03). A 63% increase in number of epochs spent in this indeterminate period was evident during vibration, During the post-stimulus period, percentage of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep decreased as compared to the pre-stimulus period (P<0.04), and non-rapid eye movement sleep increased as compared to the stimulus period (P<0.01). Vibration-induced intrauterine sound pressures ranged from 131-142 dB at the fundamental frequency of 19 Hz and were 20-40 dB lower at the overtones which appeared in the spectrum between 35-200 Hz. Results indicated that environmental vibration can disrupt fetal behavioral state, induce abnormal state changes, and alter distribution of sleep states.

AB The artificial endocrine pancreas (AEP) is a controlled glucose and/or insulin infusion system in which continuously monitored blood sugar values are fed to a computerised analyser that uses predetermined algorithms to establish the doses to be administered. Since its first appearance in clinical practice and diabetological research during the Sixties, the AEP has been modified in various ways to overcome technical problems associated with the gluco-sensor and algorithms so as to make better use of the glucose-insulin feedback mechanism, and hence obtain a closer correspondence to physiological islet cell activity. As a result of these changes, the AEP can be employed in accordance with the physiopathological principles of insulin secretion in a variety of clinical conditions to secure the short-term control of metabolic alterations in the diabetic. Surgery is one field in which the AEP is used to great advantage, since this and its accompanying anaesthetics are the source of stress, which in turn may result in a rapid and sometimes serious postoperative metabolic derangement, including an increased secretion of anti-insulin hormones. The AEP has also been proposed for diabetic pregnancy and for the treatment of subjects in diabetic coma. It has proved useful in the diagnosis and management of hypoglycaemia due to organic hyperinsulinism, in diabetics with renal failure, in the honeymoon period, and in cases of unstable diabetes. The versatility of its application and its underlying physiopathological principles have enabled the AEP to be predominantly employed in research. This has led to an understanding of the mechanisms of insulin resistance and sensitivity, evaluation of the effects of blood glucose and insulin changes in various intermediate metabolic parameters, investigation of the behaviour of islet contra-regulation hormones, assessment of the circadian rhythm of insulin secretion, and determination of the metabolic effects of current drugs and new preparations. The elaboration of new mathematical models and the further overcoming of technical difficulties are the targets now set for improved AEP performance with a view to the creation of a reliable and effective implantable version.

Twenty-two fetuses at 36-41 weeks of gestation were exposed to white noise during an active state. The sound was delivered for 5 min at an intensity of 100 dB. No significant change in fetal activity was noted following the sound.

AB The ventilatory response to an added external dead space was assessed in preterm babies, recovering from respiratory distress syndrome, immediately prior to extubation. All babies were ready for extubation as defined by routine clinical criteria. Baseline measurements of respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute ventilation were made over a 2 min period using a computerized system consisting of a pneumotachometer connected directly to the proximal end of the endotracheal tube. The measurements were repeated after addition of an external dead space equivalent to 2 anatomical dead spaces (4.4 mL/kg body weight). Thirty-four babies were studied on 40 occasions. Twenty-four infants (60%) were successfully extubated and 16 (40%) required reintubation. Infants in the success and failure groups were matched for gestation at birth, postconceptional age and weight at the time of study, maximum ventilatory requirements, and treatment with methylxanthines. The added external dead space resulted in an increase in minute ventilation in 38 out of the 40 studies. Extubation success and failure groups were compared by expressing the minute ventilation after addition of the external dead space as a percentage of the baseline minute ventilation (%MV1). Successful extubation was associated with a higher median %MV1 compared with babies who failed extubation (156; range, 89.3 to 230; compared to 131; range, 75.2 to 165; P = 0.006). This test may be useful in deciding which babies could be successfully extubated.

   OPIATE-WITHDRAWAL; SUBSTANCE-ABUSE; PREGNANCY
AB Use of addicting drugs among women during pregnancy exposes newborns to potentially serious disorders. A group of symptoms referred to as neonatal withdrawal syndrome (NWS) may occur in infants born to mothers addicted to certain drugs because, at birth, the infants suddenly are cut off from the drug supply. Classes of drugs that cause NWS are those that produce addiction in adults, including the opioids (heroin, methadone, morphine), barbiturates, alcohol, and benzodiazepines. Many of the manifestations of NWS occur regardless of the class of drug, including irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and failure to gain weight. The fact that these symptoms are nonspecific makes it difficult to identify NWS unless it is specifically looked for. The onset, duration, and severity of the disorder differ based on such factors as the addictive drug used, time and amount of mother's last dose, and rate of elimination of the drug from the newborn. Pharmacologic intervention may be required to control severe symptoms and signs. The most common drugs used to modify withdrawal are phenobarbital, paregoric, chlorpromazine, and diazepam. Treatment is complicated by conflicting information on the effectiveness of various agents.

AB During the third trimester of pregnancy there is a gradual development of fetal behavioral states. These states are distinct and discontinuous modes of neural activity; they reflect a certain degree of maturity and/or integrity of the fetal brain and are homologous with those seen in newborn infants. Abnormal state development has been found in growth retarded fetuses and in fetuses of women with type-1 diabetes. Behavioral state organization is not easily influenced by external factors and most stimuli fail to induce a state change when the fetus is in quiet sleep (state 1F). However, fetuses do react to vibro-acoustic stimulation (VAS) with an electronic artificial larynx. This stimulus induces excessive fetal movements, prolonged tachycardia, disorganization of behavioral states, and state transitions normally not seen in healthy fetuses. The backgrounds for these excessive and unusual reactions are largely unknown. For the time being, it seems better not to use this device in clinical practice. In this review paper, data on the development of behavioral states and on fetal reactions to VAS are discussed.

AB OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to perform a longitudinal cohort study of 20 normal third-trimester pregnancies to observe whether the level of long-term maternal caffeine ingestion influenced fetal behavior.
   STUDY DESIGN: By dietary history 10 normal pregnant women were categorized as ''high'' caffeine consumers (> 500 mg/day, group H) and 1 0 as ''low'' caffeine consumers (< 200 mg/day, group L). Between 30 and 40 weeks biweekly 2-hour continuous ultrasonographic observations of fetal heart rate; breathing activity; and eye, trunk, and extremity movements were conducted. Maternal caffeine levels were determined at each session, and fetal states were identified and their duration quantified. Data were compared by analysis of variance by means of repeated measures or t tests.
   RESULTS: When compared with group L fetuses, group H fetuses spent similar mean time in state 1F (quiet sleep), less mean time in state 2F (active sleep), and much greater mean time in state 4F (arousal). The mean time spent in no state decreased significantly in group L, was unchanged in group H, and was similar for both groups at term. Both groups had similar mean numbers of state changes at all gestational ages studied. Mean maternal serum caffeine levels in group H were always significantly higher than those in group L.
   CONCLUSION: Evolving fetal behavior may be influenced by the level of maternal caffeine consumption during the last trimester.

AB OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to document the presence or significance of circadian uterine activity rhythms in pregnant women who delivered at term and preterm.
   STUDY DESIGN: We measured uterine activity in 19 women divided into a control group (low risk for preterm labor, term delivery, n = 7), a group at high risk for preterm labor, term delivery (n = 6), and a group at high risk for preterm labor, preterm delivery (n = 6). Patients were hospitalized for 24 hours every 2 weeks from 26 weeks' gestation until delivery. Uterine activity was measured continuously by external tocodynamometer.
   RESULTS: Patients delivering at term demonstrated a nocturnal surge (4 to 7 AM) in uterine activity the last 80 days before delivery (p < 0.05, analysis of variance). Patients delivered preterm showed an initial nocturnal surge of uterine activity similar to those delivered at term, but this disappeared 24 days before delivery (p > 0.05, analysis of variance).
   CONCLUSION: Uterine activity nocturnal surges normally precede term delivery. These surges are lost in women who deliver prematurely.

AB To determine whether 24-h rhythms characterize hormone secretion and uterine activity in the pregnant sheep, blood samples were drawn every 1-4 h for 48 h from ewes and fetuses from day 120 of gestation to term. Repetitive 24-h rhythms were absent for cortisol, progesterone, and prolactin in maternal and fetal circulation and for hourly mean uterine contraction rate and amplitude. To test whether photoperiod or pineal melatonin contributes to the absence of rhythms, pineal-intact and pinealectomized ewes and their fetuses were studied in reverse photoperiod. Again, there was little evidence to suggest 24-h endocrine rhythms except for prolactin in two fetuses by cosinor analyses. Prolactin concentrations were increased in pinealectomized ewes and their fetuses. In the apparent absence of rhythms, 20 of 21 pineal-intact ewes gave birth at night; however, 6 out of 7 pinealectomized ewes gave birth during the day. Thus photoperiod and the maternal pineal gland profoundly influenced the time of day of birth in the absence of circadian endocrine or uterine activity rhythms.

AB The human hypothalamus is involved in a wide range of functions in the developing, adult and aging subject and is responsible for a large number of symptoms of neuroendocrine, neurological and psychiatric diseases. In the present review some prominent hypothalamic nuclei are discussed in relation to normal development, sexual differentiation, aging and a number of neuropathological conditions.
   The suprachiasmatic nucleus, the clock of the brain, shows seasonal and circadian variations in its vasopressin neurons. During normal aging, but even more so in Alzheimer's disease, the number of these neurons decreases. In homosexual men this nucleus is larger than in heterosexual men.
   The difference between the sexually dimorphic nuclei of men and women arises between the ages of 2-4 to puberty. In adult men this nucleus is twice as large as in adult women. In the process of aging, a sex-dependent decrease in cell number occurs. The vasopressin and oxytocin cells of the supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus are present in adult numbers as early as mid-gestation. Lower oxytocin neuron numbers are found in Prader-Willi syndrome, AIDS and Parkinson's disease. Familial hypothalamic diabetes insipidus is based upon a point mutation in the vasopressin-neurophysin-glycopeptide gene.
   Parvicellular corticotropin-releasing hormone-containing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus increase in number and are activated during the course of aging.
   In post-menopausal women, the infundibular or arcuate nucleus contains hypertrophic neurons containing oestrogen receptors. These neurons may be involved in the initiation of menopausal flushes.
   The nucleus tuberalis lateralis may be involved in feeding behaviour and metabolism. In Huntington's disease the majority of its neurons is lost; in Alzheimer's disease it shows very strong cytoskeletal alterations.
   Tuberomammillary nucleus neurons contain, e.g., histamine or galanine, and project to the cortex. Strong cytoskeletal changes, as well as plaques and tangles are found in this nucleus in Alzheimer's disease.
   The various hypothalamic nuclei are probably involved in many functions and symptoms of which only a minority has been revealed.

AB A carbon dioxide hypersensitivity theory of panic has been posited. We hypothesize more broadly that a physiologic misinterpretation by a suffocation monitor misfires an evolved suffocation alarm system. This produces sudden respiratory distress followed swiftly by a brief hyperventilation, panic, and the urge to flee. Carbon dioxide hypersensitivity is seen as due to the deranged suffocation alarm monitor. If other indicators of potential suffocation provoke panic, this theoretical extension is supported. We broadly pursue this theory by examining Ondine's curse as the physiologic and pharmacologic converse of panic disorder, splitting panic in terms of symptomatology and challenge studies, reevaluating the role of hyperventilation, and reinterpreting the contagiousness of sighing and yawning, as well as mass hysteria. Further, the phenomena of panic during relaxation and sleep, late luteal phase dysphoric disorder, pregnancy, childbirth, pulmonary disease, separation anxiety, and treatment are used to test and illuminate the suffocation false alarm theory.

AB Conventional time-unspecified single measurements of blood pressure and heart rate may be misleading because they may be influenced, among other factors, by the patient's emotional state, position, diet, and external stimuli.  All of these effects depend on the stages of a (mathematical) spectrum of rhythms and trends with age. The evaluation of predictable variability in blood pressure and heart rate by (a) the use of fully ambulatory devices, and (b) chronobiologic data processing, assesses early cardiovascular disease risk, e.g., in pregnancy. We have used this approach to quantify changes in 24-h synchronized (circadian) characteristics of cardiovascular variables in two consecutive pregnancies of a clinically healthy woman. Blood pressure and hear-t rate were automatically monitored, with few interruptions, at 1-h intervals, each time for at least 48 consecutive h, and for a total of 76 days of monitoring in each pregnancy. Circadian parameters of those circulatory variables were computed for each single day of measurement by the least-squares fit of a 24-h cosine curve. Regression analysis of parameters thus obtained revealed patterns of variation of circadian-rhythm-adjusted means and amplitudes with gestational age. In both pregnancies, the predictable variability of the circadian-rhythm-adjusted mean of blood pressure can be approximated by a second-order polynomial model on gestational age: a steady linear decrease in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure up to the 22nd week of pregnancy is followed by an increase in blood pressure up to the day of delivery. This longitudinal study confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable pregnancy-associated variability in blood pressure and heart rate and also allows the establishment of prediction and confidence limits for cardiovascular parameters in a healthy pregnancy.

   ACCELERATIONS
AB In order to understand the mechanisms which regulate and control basal heart rate as well as heart rate variability in the fetus, a number of studies have been conducted in fetal animals. Information has been obtained largely from fetal sheep during the last third of gestation, although recently investigators have directed their attention to earlier gestations, such as 80-90 days, with term in the sheep being 145 days. A few studies have focused on the non-human primate fetus for additional information. A variety of techniques has been utilized experimentally to produce hypoxemia and/or acidemia in fetal animals, including umbilical cord compression, maternal hypoxemia, and uterine blood flow restrictions. Evidence to date would indicate that both chemoreceptors and baroreceptors are present and active in the late gestation sheep fetus, giving rise to acute changes in fetal heart rate (FHR) with changes in oxygenation. Factors which must be considered in interpreting alterations in both mean FHR and FHR variability in response to a decrease in oxygenation include: 1) the mechanism giving rise to decrease in oxygen delivery, 2) the duration of hypoxemia and/or asphyxia, 3) the effect of sleep states and behavioural activity, 4) gestational age, and 5) condition of the fetus prior to the decrease in oxygen delivery. Heart rate variability in fetal sheep has been studied extensively and it has been shown that accelerations in the FHR are closely associated with skeletal muscle activity much like the human fetus, suggesting similar control mechanisms in the 2 species. The late gestation sheep fetus consistently and reliably experiences an increase in heart rate variability with acute hypoxemia with and without acidemia until severe acidosis develops. In contrast, the hypoxemic human fetus, prior to labour, generally exhibits a decrease in FHR variability. The explanation for this apparent species difference remains unclear.

AB We examined 96 normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation to determine the relationship between the duration of the active state following a single vibroacoustic stimulus (VAS) and the time spent in prestimulus state 1F, i.e. quiet sleep (QS). All fetuses were observed to enter state 1F prior to testing. After remaining in this state for 3 min, each fetus was randomized into one of three groups: no stimulation (Group I, N = 32); a single 1-s VAS delivered after 3-5 min of QS (Group II, N = 33); and a single 1-s VAS delivered after 18-20 min of QS (Group III, N = 31). Fetuses in Groups I, II, and III were otherwise behaviourally indistinguishable. Heart rate and eye and body movements were monitored until the fetus either returned to state 1F and remained in that state for 3 min or did not return to state 1F within 60 min. Of the 64 fetuses who were stimulated, 62 responded, indicating that there was no effect of prestimulus state duration on the sensitivity to VAS. Fetuses stimulated after 18-20 min of QS behaved similarly to fetuses who entered an active period spontaneously. However, fetuses who were in QS for 3-5 min remained in a more active state for a significantly shorter length of time than did fetuses who either had been in QS for 18-20 min before VAS (17.9 min vs. 38.0 min, P = 0.0002) or had entered an active period spontaneously (17.9 min vs. 41.1 min, P = 0.0001); 10 (30.3%) fetuses in Group II and two (6.5%) fetuses in Group III were active for less-than-or-equal-to 3 min following VAS (P = 0.015). Even when the 10 fetuses in Group II who did not make a state change were excluded from analysis, the mean duration of the active period was significantly less for Group II fetuses than for fetuses in either Groups I (P = 0.0010) or III (P = 0.0058). We conclude that, for fetuses who were otherwise behaviourally indistinguishable at the time of stimulation, the nature of the behavioural response following a single VAS was dependent upon the prestimulus duration of state 1F.

AB Women are at a greater risk compared to men for blinding complications from trachoma. In order to evaluate risk factors in women, 205 cases of trichiasis (TT) were selected from 11 villages in rural Tanzania. Each case of trichiasis was matched to two women of the same age and from the same village, who had no clinical signs of trachoma. Factors associated with trichiasis in a conditional logistic regression included history of trichiasis in the woman's mother (odds ratio [OR] = 3.6; 95% confidence interval [Cl] : 2.0-6.5); sleeping in a room with a cooking fire during childbearing years (OR = 1.8; 95% Cl : 1.2-2.8); a home of wood and earth during childbearing years (OR = 2.1; 95% Cl : 1.3-3.3); no adult education classes (OR = 2.2; 95% Cl : 1.4-3.4); and five or more deaths among her children (OR = 2.6; 95% Cl : 1.3-5.1). Detailed measures of prolonged exposure to child care as a young girl and as a mother showed no significant difference between cases and controls. Results from this study characterize women at high risk for severe disease and eventual blindness in a trachoma endemic area.

AB In a cross-sectional epidemiological study of headache disorders information on precipitating factors, age at onset, influence of menstruation and pregnancy and use of oral contraceptives was collected. The presence of migraine and tension-type headache was ascertained by a clinical interview and examination using the operational diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society. The prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache was also analysed in relation to variables of lifestyle: physical activity, smoking, consumption of coffee, alcohol intake and sleep pattern. In both migraine and tension-type headache, the most conspicuous precipitating factor was stress and mental tension. Other common precipitants were alcohol, weather changes and menstruation. Disappearance or substantial improvement of the headache during pregnancy was more frequent in migraineurs than in tension-type headache sufferers. The age at onset of both migraine and tension-type headache differs between men and women. Female hormones may be an important factor responsible for the sex difference of headache disorders. The level of physical activity showed no association with migraine, but a significantly higher prevalence of tension-type headache in men with exclusively sedentary activity emerged. Smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption showed no significant associations with the headache disorders. Sleep pattern was significantly associated with migraine and tension-type headache in both univariate and multivariate analyses. In conclusion, migraine and tension-type headache seem to be different with regard to a number of endogenous and exogenous factors.

There was good agreement on demographic factors, maternal obstetric history, parental smoking, and infant feeding practices. Reported changes in sleep habits were slightly greater for cases, and further work is needed to determine if this reflects recall bias or real changes during early infant life. Case mother reports regarding family history of disease and infant bedding were more discrepant, suggesting recall bias and supporting prospective collection of this information.

AB The role of the fetal circadian pacemaker in the timing of birth was examined in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Two groups of pregnant hamsters with lesions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus received daily intraperitoneal injections of melatonin (25 mug) on Days 9-15 of gestation. One group was injected with melatonin in the evening and the other in the morning. After the last set of injections, the animals were observed every hour until they gave birth. The timing of birth was not significantly different in the two groups, indicating that it was not affected by the melatonin injections. In contrast, the average phases of the pups' activity rhythms at weaning were significantly different in the two groups; this difference, approximately 10 h, indicated that the prenatal melatonin injections set the phases of the pups' circadian pacemakers. These results suggest that the fetal pacemaker is not involved in the timing of birth, since the pacemaker could be set to different phases without affecting this timing. In a separate study, time of birth and length of gestation were measured for heterozygous tau mutant pups, which express a circadian rhythm with a period of approximately 22 h.  The results were compared with similar measurements obtained from a previous study of wild-type pups that express a circadian rhythm with a period of approximately 24 h. In both cases, the pups had been born to wild-type mothers. The timing of birth was similar in the two groups, indicating that the tau mutation does not influence the length of gestation or the time of day when birth occurs.

   Data extraction and synthesis: Several criteria have been used to measure fetal response: gestational age, fetal heart rate, fetal movements, fetal breathing movements, fetal habituation, and fetal behavioral states. The use of vibroacoustic stimulation for antepartum and intrapartum fetal assessment and safety issues are also reviewed.
   Conclusion: Although further research is needed, the ability of vibroacoustic stimulation to elicit FHR accelerations has been established, thus decreasing the false-positive rate associated with nonreactive nonstress testing.

AB It is well known that prenatal stress induces behavioral demasculinization and/or feminization in male offspring during adulthood. In this study, four different stressors were prenatally applied to rats. Pregnant rats were subjected to immobilization, unavoidable electric foot shocks, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REMd), or immersion in cold water. During adulthood, male offspring were tested for masculine and feminine sexual behavior. The results corroborated the fact that immobilization induced an impairment of masculine sexual behavior and a facilitation of feminine sexual behavior. Electric shocks showed only minor differences in masculine behavior when compared to intact controls, and no signs of lordosis behavior were observed. The REMd group displayed a major impairment of masculine behavior, even greater than that observed within the immobilization group. However, lordosis behavior was only induced with estradiol. On the other hand, water immersion seems to have a facilitatory effect on several parameters of masculine behavior and did not show lordosis behavior even with hormonal treatment. These results strongly suggest that changes in sex behavior induced by prenatal stress are linked to the nature of the stressor.

AB Cocaine use by pregnant women has been reported to cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that human neonates exposed to cocaine via maternal use during pregnancy might manifest changes in beat-to-beat heart rate variability, similar to those described in experimental animals. In this preliminary report, we present findings from the first systematic analysis of heart rate dynamics in a small group of (n = 5) neonates exposed in utero to cocaine compared to gestationally age matched controls (n = 6) without known drug exposure. Overall heart Tate spectral power during ten minute periods of quiescent sleep was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in the cocaine-exposed group, reminiscent of the changes recently reported in an animal model. In two other cocaine-exposed newborns, a quiescent sleep period could not be found. We discuss the special methodological problems associated with collection and interpretation of such data.

AB Ultradian rhythms in electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in premature neonates were studied. The values of square roots of total power (SQP) of EEG showed a normal Gaussian distribution. We analyzed the smoothed time series of SQP by autoregressive analysis and component analysis. Ultradian rhythm was divided into four groups by period length (group I: 5-30 min, group II: 30-60 min, group III: 60-100 min, group IV: longer than 100 min). Group IV rhythms were not detected before 32 weeks of gestation. Changes in the characteristic values of ultradian components in group II showed that there were critical periods in the development of central nervous activity at 29 and 33 weeks of gestation. This method allowed detection of ultradian rhythms, even at very early gestation, directly from the neonatal central nervous system. This method may be applicable to ill infants.

AB The physiology of parturition, and the pathophysiology of preterm labor, is incompletely understood. Infection of gestational tissues may account for a significant proportion of women who experience preterm labor. Interleukin-8 (IL-8), or neutrophil-activating protein (NAP-1), is a potent chemotactic and activating factor for neutrophils and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory injury to skin and lung, but has yet to be described in gestational tissues. Cultured chorion and decidual cells obtained from normal human pregnancies were used to evaluate whether these tissues produce IL-8 basally and in response to inflammatory cytokines. As measured by specific IL-8 RIA, chorion and decidual cells produce IL-8 constitutively and in response to IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor. Cotreatment of chorion cells or decidual cells with IL-1beta and actinomycin D or cycloheximide abrogated IL-8 production. Northern blot analysis confirmed that IL-1beta stimulation of chorion and decidual cells resulted in increased IL-8 messenger RNA expression. Our data support the concept that a complex cytokine network between maternal and fetal gestational tissues exists, and that activation of inflammatory cytokine production in these tissues, including IL-8, likely contributes to the pathophysiology of infection-induced preterm labor.

AB The study objective was to investigate whether exclusively breast-fed infants could be taught to sleep through the night (defined from 12:00 AM to 5:00 AM) during the first 8 weeks of life. The design was short-term longitudinal, from the last trimester of pregnancy until the eighth week after birth. Twenty-six first-time parents and their newborn were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups (13 in each group). Treatment parents were instructed to offer a ''focal feed'' (between 10 PM and 12 AM) to their infants every night, to gradually lengthen intervals between middle-of-the-night feeds by carrying out alternative caretaking behaviors (eg, reswaddling, diapering, walking), and to maximize environmental differences between day and nighttime. All parents kept 72-hour diaries of their infants' feeding and sleeping patterns every week from birth to 8 weeks of age and rated their infants' temperament at birth and at 8 weeks. By 3 weeks, treatment infants showed significantly longer sleep episodes at night. By 8 weeks 100% of treatment infants were sleeping through the night compared to 23% of control infants. Treatment infants were feeding less frequently at night but compensated for the relatively long nighttime interval without a feed by consuming more milk in the early morning. Milk intake for 24-hour periods did not differ between groups. Treatment infants were rated as more predictable on Bates' Infant Characteristics Questionnaire. It is concluded that parents can have a powerful influence on the development of their infants' sleep patterns. Frequent night waking in breast-fed infants often results in early termination of lactation. Parents can teach their breast-fed infants to lengthen their nighttime sleep bouts, making the continuation of breast-feeding easier for the new mother.

AB In utero exposure to alcohol has been associated with many physical deficits and behavioral abnormalities. The purpose of these studies was to determine the effects of in utero administration of alcohol on behaviors related to tolerance and sensitivity to alcohol in adult rats. Pregnant rats were maintained on a liquid diet containing alcohol [35% ethanol-derived calories (EDC)] throughout pregnancy. Offspring manifested physical characteristics of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The 35% EDC group was able to stay on a wooden dowel longer and at higher blood alcohol concentrations than were pair-fed controls. Following a hypnotic dose of alcohol, rats in the 35% EDC group slept longer than pair-fed controls. A greater alcohol-induced hypothermic effect was seen in females in the 35% EDC group than in controls. Treatment did not affect rate of metabolism of alcohol. These studies suggest that in utero administration of alcohol may be a factor in determining an individual's sensitivity and tolerance to alcohol and possibly their preference for alcohol.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether large antepartum decelerations in fetal heart rate were associated with a switch from high to low fetal heart rate variation, suggestive of a change in sleep state, and whether the variation predicted outcome.
   STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective computerized analysis of 10,272 cardiotocographic records from 3998 patients at 37 to 42 weeks' gestation from four centers in England and Italy identified 140 good-quality records with large decelerations (more than 20 lost beats in area).
   RESULTS: In otherwise normal cardiotocograms a large deceleration had a 40% chance of association with a downward change in fetal heart rate variation (69% when the deceleration exceeded 100 lost beats). The change resembled that occurring naturally with behavioral states. Uterine contractions did not al,ways precede large decelerations. When they did, the lag time (peak of contraction - trough of deceleration) increased from 28 seconds (at 20 to 29 lost beats) to > 100 seconds with increase in deceleration area. Of patients with large decelerations 76% had a normal vaginal delivery.
   CONCLUSION: Large decelerations near term, present in up to 5% of patients with otherwise normal fetal heart rate and variation, are often associated with a fall in fetal heart rate variation characteristic of a change in sleep state, without ominous significance.

In the prepartum, a highly significant circadian rhythm was seen in cortisol, with a lower-amplitude rhythm in progesterone (AM/PM = 1.12). Evening samples showed a rise in cortisol, with a highly significant rise on day -1. The rise was small. The fall in progesterone in the 3 days before parturition was also small (approximately 6%). Neither change provides an obvious trigger for parturition.

AB This study examines the effects of altering the prenatal maternal metabolic and hormonal environment via chronic cold exposure of under-fed ewes on developmental changes in breathing control of developing lambs. Breathing frequency and timing were measured during non rapid-eye-movement (non-REM) sleep in lambs born from either shorn or unshorn ewes after being maintained for at least one hour at warm (28-19-degrees-C) and cool (14-5-degrees-C) ambient temperatures at 1, 4, 14 and 30 days of age. Breathing frequency and oxygen consumption were significantly higher in 1 day old lambs born from shorn ewes compared with those lambs born from unshorn ewes, at both warm and cool ambient temperatures. In the shorn group breathing frequency decreased between 1 and 4 days of age and continued decreasing upto 30 days of age, during which period inspiratory and to a greater extent expiratory time, lengthened. Laryngeal ''braking'' of expiratory airflow was observed in more than 50% of lambs born from shorn ewes during non-REM sleep in the warm at 4, 14 and 30 days of age, and in the cold at 14 and 30 days of age. In contrast, lambs born from unshorn ewes showed no change in breathing frequency between 1 and 4 days of age, but a decrease was observed between 4 and 14 days of age, whilst laryngeal ''braking'' of expiratory airflow was rarely observed at any age. It is concluded that the development of breathing control over the first month of postnatal life can be affected by alterations in the fetal environment elicited by chronic cold exposure of the mother.

AB In a pilot study 28 new-born babies (average age about 38 hours) were investigated to see whether they could already recognise their mother's voice and other sounds to which they had been exposed before birth. More than half of the babies who could be observed while awake did indeed appear to pay special attention to their mother's voice, but not to any other woman's voice, nor to a lullaby which the mother had played to them regularly in late pregnancy. Most of the new-born babies, who had been regularly exposed to an alarming noise in late pregnancy, were not startled by such a noise, either when sleeping or awake. In contrast, all the neonates without such previous exposure did show a startled reaction to the alarming noise.

AB As the only obligatorily predatory primates, tarsiers are notoriously difficult to keep successfully in captivity. Here we report empirical and experimental results from a 5-year study of behavior and life history in captive Tarsius bancanus. Four reproducing adult tarsiers used space nonrandomly, preferring small-diameter vertical or near-vertical locomotor substrates at midlevel enclosure heights (1.2-2.1 m) for sleeping, scanning, and prey capture. The tarsiers were completely nocturnal, and spent 78% of the scotophase scanning, 13% sleeping, and 9% in prey capture and other activities. Only live crickets were eaten; prey capture rates were highest in the first hour after waking, but overall activity rates were highest later in the scotophase. Adult males and nonpregnant or lactating females ingested approximately 44.7-49.7 kJ/day. Growing and lactating individuals ingested approximately 84.4-94.1 kJ/day. An energetically conservative, sit-and-wait predatory strategy was employed, in which 88% of capture attempts were successful. Most successful prey captures involved reaching for, or leaping from, 90-degrees or 60-degrees supports in a horizontal or downward direction onto prey less than 0.6 m away. Virtually all prey captures were in arboreal locations, despite much higher densities of crickets on enclosure floors. Prey capture rates during the first hour of the nocturnal activity period were positively correlated with arboreal cricket densities. At constant arboreal cricket densities, capture rates were negatively correlated with ambient light intensity, with optimum levels for prey capture ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 Lux. In term s of social behavior, these T. bancanus were nongregarious. Females enforced interindividual spacing by chasing and displacing males. Chase/displacement rates increased significantly during late pregnancy and lactation, apparently in an attempt to keep males from harassing infants. There was no direct male parental care. Infants were precocial at birth, and grew at a rate of 0.35-0.5 g/day, until nutritional weaning at approximately 60 days of age. The implications of specialized predatory morphology and behavior for management are discussed.

AB OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to determine whether plasma oxytocin concentrations show a daily rhythm.
   STUDY DESIGN: Ten women between 37 and 39 weeks of gestation volunteered for the study. They were admitted 1 to 2 days before the experiment. Three blood samples were taken with 2-minute intervals each time, at 8 AM, 4 PM, and 12 midnight. Oxytocin, 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol were measured by radioimmunoassay with highly specific antibodies. Statistical analysis of variance by Friedman's test was followed by multiple range testing, and p < 0.05 was considered significant.
   RESULTS: Significant daily rhythm was found for plasma cortisol, progesterone, and oxytocin and for the estradiol/progesterone ratio. Oxytocin showed a nocturnal peak and a strong negative correlation with the estradiol/progesterone ratio.
   CONCLUSIONS: The daily rhythm in plasma oxytocin parallels the rhythm in uterine activity (shown by others), suggesting a causal relationship between the two. Both may in turn be related to the ratio of circulating estradiol and progesterone.

AB OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to measure central nervous system insult from prenatal phenobarbital by quantified electroencephalographic evaluation of mature rat offspring.
   STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four adult female rats were given phenobarbital as 0, 20, 40, or 60 mg/kg/day subcutaneously between 9 and 1 0 AM for 28 days before breeding and throughout gestation. The electroencephalograms of 90-day-old offspring were sampled over 24 hours and converted to the power spectra.
   RESULTS: Female offspring exposed prenatally to 20 mg and males exposed prenatally to 40 mg displayed an increase in delta and a decrease in alpha and middle-beta waveform activities. Females exposed prenatally to 40 mg and males exposed prenatally to 60 mg displayed decreases in delta, theta, alpha, and middle-beta activities.
   CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal phenobarbital exposure produced dose- and sex-dependent changes in the electroencephalogram of mature offspring consistent with a generalized deficit in the neuronal synchronization mechanisms that are critical for normal sleep and learning.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although maternal cocaine administration results in fetal cardiovascular and behavioral alterations, these responses have been attributed to hypoxia resulting from reduced uteroplacental blood flow. We studied the fetal catecholamine, cardiovascular, and neurobehavioral responses to direct fetal cocaine administration.
   STUDY DESIGN: Cardiovascular, electrocortical, and electroocular responses and plasma catecholamines were monitored in chronically catheterized fetal sheep (n = 7), 127 +/- 2 days' gestation, during a control period and after intravenous fetal injections of cocaine 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg.
   RESULTS: Intravenous cocaine caused prompt increases in fetal plasma norepinephrine (372 +/- 73 to 531 +/- 112 and 842 +/- 233 pg/ml), epinephrine (27 +/- 7 to 46 +/- 13 and 49 +/- 11 pg/ml), and systolic blood pressure (46 +/- 2 to 53 +/- 2 and 55 +/- 2 mm Hg). Low-voltage electrocortical activity decreased from 61.7% +/- 3.0% to 38.4% +/- 3.9% in the first hour after the cocaine 0.5 mg/kg dose but recovered to baseline values during the second hour. After the cocaine 1.0 mg/kg dose, low-voltage electrocortical activity decreased to 40.7% +/- 2.0% and did not recover thereafter. Fetal blood gas values did not change.
   CONCLUSION: Direct fetal cocaine administration increases fetal plasma catecholamine levels and fetal blood pressure and suppresses low-voltage electrocortical activity. Chronic cocaine exposure may hamper central nervous system maturation and alter postnatal development.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine if dexamethasone alters myometrial responsiveness to oxytocin or oxytocin secretion.
   STUDY DESIGN: Studies were conducted in rhesus macaques (n = 6), between 144 and 148 days' gestation (term 167 days). The first study was conducted at 9 Am and repeated 36 hours later at 9 Pm. At 9 Am the following morning a continuous maternal dexamethasone infusion (15 mug/kg/hr given intravenously) was initiated, and the study was repeated at 9 Pm, 60 hours later. Four doses of oxytocin (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 pg/kg/min) were administered as 1-minute pulses every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. The number of contractions per pulse (contraction/pulse ratio) was used to determine differences in myometrial responsiveness.
   RESULTS: Before dexamethasone infusion there was a circadian rhythm in uterine activity with peak contractile events between 8 and 10 Pm (p < 0.01), whereas during infusion the rhythm was ablated. At oxytocin dose 1, the 9 Am contraction/pulse ratio (0.3 +/- 0.1) was lower than that for 9 PM (0.6 +/- 0.2) and for 60 hours later (0.6 +/- 0.1) (mean +/- SE, p < 0.05). Similar results were observed at dose 2, whereas no differences in the contraction/pulse ratio were noted at dose 3. Basal plasma oxytocin concentrations were unaffected by dexamethasone treatment, whereas plasma estradiol and cortisol concentrations were reduced compared with control values (p < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: (1) There is a differential sensitivity to oxytocin between morning and evening and (2) the dexamethasone-induced loss of the uterine contractile rhythm is not the result of a loss of myometrial sensitivity to oxytocin or to a suppression of plasma oxytocin concentrations.

AB Self-reported sleep disturbances and levels of vitality and fatigue were studied in a secondary analysis of 25 pregnant and 29 postpartum employed women. Results indicate that pregnant women have problems initiating and maintaining sleep, and postpartum women have problems maintaining sleep, but not falling asleep. The primary reason for midsleep awakenings was urinary frequency among the pregnant women, and child care responsibilities among the postpartum women. Chronic sleep disturbance was indicated by a greater percentage of postpartum women who fell asleep easily, very few who felt highly energetic at work, and most who perceived a high level of fatigue during the past week. Even with these sleep disruptions, no differences occurred in the mean scores for perception of fatigue and vitality between the two groups. Clinicians can use these findings to educate women about some changes they may anticipate and how they might manage them during pregnancy and postpartum.

TI EFFECTS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE ON CHILDBIRTH - ONE WOMANS STORY
SO BIRTH-ISSUES IN PERINATAL CARE
LA English
DT Article
AB Anna Rose is a survivor of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Much of the abuse was "submerged" until her mid-thirties, when she was pregnant with her second child, and finally began to remember and deal with the realities of what had happened to her. During her second pregnancy, Anna wrote, "It has taken me more than three years to even begin to deal with the rage I feel about my first birth experience, even though I have been in therapy most of that time.  Now that I am pregnant again, the unresolved issues are coming to the surface, and intense fears that this birth will be a repeat of the first." Anna's first child, Elliot, was born in 1987 in a hospital birthing room in the northeastern United States. Her husband Paul, a younger sister, and a close friend were present, and she was attended by an obstetrician named Bernie. She describes that birth as "19 hours of hard labor, absolutely exhausting and unmanageable, which required drugs at some point to let me sleep for a few hours. " Labor was induced by Pitocin due to premature rupture of membranes and lack of effective contractions after 12 hours. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring was used throughout labor. Anna breastfed Elliot for three years, and found La Leche League "extremely helpful and supportive" during that time.
   Tom, Anna's second child, was born at home in 1991. Two midwives attended the birth after she changed caregivers during the pregnancy because she "did not feel safe enough" with the obstetrician and nurse-midwife team she had chosen for this birth. She maintained the team as backup, although they did not know of her plans for a home birth. Her second labor lasted under 6 hours, was noninterventive, and "incredibly intense and painful, partly due to the abuse memories that were coming up and getting in the way and partly due to the baby's position." We thank Anna Rose for sharing her story with Birth. Her reason for doing so is, in her words, because, "I feel strongly that it is important to share this information in an effort to educate health care professionals so that other women may be helped."

AB A proportion of preterm infants respond to an external airway obstruction by becoming apneic. We have studied 23 infants (median birthweight, 1.14 kg; gestation, 29 weeks) on 80 occasions, to determine the time course of the response and its relationship with spontaneous apnea occurrence. Upper airway flow was measured with a face mask and pneumotachograph, and a tap was turned intermittently to produce an occlusion.
   A total of 380 occlusions were analyzed. The infants became apneic during the obstruction on 72 occasions (19%), and after the obstruction on 122 occasions (32%). Both of these events were significantly more common than immediately prior to the obstruction, when apnea occurred on 29 occasions (8%). Of the apneas following occlusion 57% were central in type. The point in the respiratory cycle at which obstruction occurred had no effect on the production of apnea. An obstruction score was calculated for each study. This was the mean of the number of apneas during and after each obstruction, expressed as a percentage of the number of obstructions per study. This score was positively correlated with the number of spontaneous apneas recorded. Obstruction score rose from a mean of 20% during days 0-14, to 34% during days 15-28, and thereafter it declined. This pattern may be relevant to the time course of apnea in susceptible infants.

Two to eight days after surgery, fetuses received either a continuous 60 min intravenous infusion of cocaine HCI (33.4 mg) or saline. The infusions were preceded and followed by control periods of 102 min. Cocaine induced a disruption in fetal behavioral state cyclicity and a decrease in the amount of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep (P < 0.01) and non-rapid eye movement sleep (P < 0.05) during the infusion, but not during the recovery period. Spectral amplitude of the electrocortical activity at all three cortical locations increased within most one-third octave bands between 0.8-4 Hz and decreased within most bands between 16-25 Hz (P < 0.05) compared to controls. There were no differences in spectral amplitude between pre- and post-cocaine periods at any location over the 25 frequency bands studied (P > 0.6) except for one frequency band centered at 12.5 Hz. The effects of a one hour cocaine infusion on fetal cortical electrical activity are diffuse, but short-lived, and occur independently of changes in fetal oxygenation.

AB The neocortical ventricular zone is composed of a desynchronized population of proliferating cells. These cells give rise to neurons in the infragranular laminae of neocortex. The present study documents a diurnal rhythmicity of cell proliferation in the ventricular zone and examines the effects of ethanol on this biological clock. Pregnant rats were fed one of 3 diets. They were provided an ethanol-containing (6.7% v/v) liquid diet ad libitum between gestational day (G) 6 and G18, pair-fed an isocaloric liquid control diet, or fed chow and water. Throughout the experiments, the rats were fed either at 08.00 h (E.S.T.) or at 17.00 h (lights on 06.00 to 18.00 h). Rats were given a single injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on G17 at one point during a 24 h period (03.00, 06.00, 09.00 h, etc.). The fraction of ventricular cells that incorporated the BrdU was determined using quantitative immunohistochemical methods. Pair-fed control rats (fed at 08.00 or 17.00 h) consumed their food within 4 h of presentation. The ratio of cells passing through the S-phase of the cell cycle changed diurnally; the ratio was highest during the day (0.52 +/- 0.01 at 12.00 h) and lowest during the night (0.40 +/- 0.02 at 03.00 h). In contrast, the ethanol-fed rats grazed on their food throughout the dark cycle regardless of when the food was presented. The mean peak blood ethanol concentration was 142 +/- 13 mg/dl during the dark phase and less than 25 mg/dl during the light phase. Prenatal exposure to ethanol eliminates the fetal circadian rhythm in cell proliferation (mean labeling index of 0.45 +/- 0.03). This ethanol-induced alteration demonstrates the resiliency of the developing system; its ability to compensate for traumas that alter the epigenetic control of development.

AB OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to study the sleep quality in women with preeclampsia with a special reference to nocturnal body movement activity.
   STUDY DESIGN: Sleep quality was evaluated in nine women with preeclampsia and eight women with normal term pregnancy by means of questionnaires and by recording the nocturnal body movement activity with the static charge-sensitive bed.
   RESULTS: Subjective sleep complaints were similar in both groups. The total movement time and the total frequency of body movements in bed were, however, significantly increased in the preeclamptic group.
   CONCLUSION: The study suggests that sleep is impaired in preeclamptic subjects.

Cocaine was infused intravenously into a 138-day-old fetus while electrocortical (ECoG), electroocular (EOG), and neck electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded. Fetal rapid eye movement (REM) and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep were disrupted during the cocaine exposure and returned to a normal pattern after infusions were stopped. Seventy-two hours later, however, we recorded generalized seizures with ECoG spike and spike wave activity.

AB We developed a new method to monitor fetal medullary respiratory neurons utilizing a two-stage approach. At 129-133 days of gestation, sheep were anesthetized, and a window was placed over the area of the fourth ventricle. After a recovery period of 3-5 days, the fetus was exteriorized into a saline bath under maternal spinal anesthesia, and the head was connected rigidly to a stereotaxic frame. Microelectrodes were inserted into the area of the nucleus tractus solitarius during rapid-eye-movement sleep, and extracellular recordings of 223 respiratory neurons were analyzed: 76% were inspiratory, 9% expiratory, and 15% phase spanning, as classified by visual and computer correlation to diaphragmatic activity. More detailed analysis of 100 neurons was done to assess the respiratory component (eta2) by use of a modification of the method developed by Orem and Dick (J. Neurophysiol. 50: 1098-1107, 1983). With use of cohorts of 25 breaths, fetal respiratory neurons were found to frequently change their phase relationship to diaphragmatic activity. The eta2 statistic of fetal respiratory neurons was not a stable characteristic but changed over time. This could be a reflection of an immature central respiratory system before birth or the lack of major sensory inputs.

ID INFANT-DEATH-SYNDROME; COT DEATH; SLEEPING POSITION; SUDDEN
AB Until recently the incidence of SIDS was about 2 per 1000 live births, about 1500 cases each year, in the United Kingdom. SIDS occurs predominantly in the first six months of life with a peak around the third and fourth months. It is commoner in boys by a ratio of 3:2. The risk increases in autumn and winter. Maternal factors are important: there is a strong correlation with age and parity, the risk of SIDS increasing in younger mothers and with rising parity. For a second born infant, for example, the risk would be sevenfold for a mother under 20 and threefold in a mother aged 20-24 compared with that of a mother of 25 years and above. The increase in mortality from SIDS associated with lower social class is no greater than would be expected from increased perinatal or total infant mortality. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is clearly a risk factor, the risk rising about fourfold for mothers who smoke 20 cigarettes a day relative to non-smokers.
   It is difficult to define an at-risk infant profile which would be of predictive value. Two aspects of infant care, prone sleeping and overheating, have both been suggested as risk factors from case control and population studies. The role of intervention programmes designed to reduce these risks is currently of public concern in the light of the recent decrease in SIDS to nearer 1 per 1000 live births reported in several countries.

AB OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that twins, when monitored simultaneously, show a remarkably high incidence of coincident fetal heart rate accelerations (about 58%). The current study examines synchrony of behavior patterns in twins.
   STUDY DESIGN: We examined 37 fetal monitor strips from 15 sets of twins with simultaneous fetal heart rate and fetal movement recorded by means of Doppler techniques (Toitu MT-430 fetal actocardiograph). The strips were analyzed for coincidence of fetal heart rate accelerations and fetal movement episodes and then conceptually for synchrony of fetal behavior patterns on the basis of descriptions of behavioral states by Prechtl.
   RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of fetal heart rate accelerations were found to be simultaneous. Forty-three percent of movement epochs were considered simultaneous. We found that twins exhibited synchronous behavior patterns (basically sleep or awake state) 94.7% of the time.
   CONCLUSION: Twin-twin interactions are more consistently related than suspected when observation is limited to heart rate alone, and the synchrony and role of fetal behavior states must be considered when twin interactions and behavior are studied.

AB Thirteen women in late stages of pregnancy underwent a polysomnographic study. Eight women (61%) complained of mild nocturnal back pain or back discomfort. Five women (39%) did not complain of nocturnal back pain. The two groups did not differ in total bed time, total sleep time, sleep latency, and wake after sleep onset (WASO). A significant decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and an increase in stage 2 were observed in the pain group. The same group had a statistically significant decrease in the basal O2 saturation level. The pain group also spent a longer time sleeping in the supine position. We hypothesize that a prolonged stay in the supine position leads to obstruction of the vena cava. In the presence of inadequate collateral circulation, increased pressure and venostasis in combination with a decrease in basal oxygen saturation may lead to hypoxemia, compromise the metabolic supply of the neural structures, and result in pain. It appears, therefore, that the vascular system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of pain. The role played by the disturbed sleep architecture in the production of pain remains to be established. It is possible that the changes observed in sleep architecture result from pain rather than contribute to pain production.

AB The general pharmacological profile of 7-fluoro-1-methyl-3-(methylsulfonyl)-4(1H)-quinolone (BTS 53 554, CAS 76568-68-8), the main metabolite of a new vasodilator, flosequinan (BTS 49 465), was investigated.
   1. The central nervous system: BTS 53 554 at the dose of 30 mg/kg i. v. caused an increase in respiratory rate and a sedation in general behavior in rats. The drug also inhibited acetic acid-induced writhing and slightly decreased normal body temperature in mice. However, the drug at the doses up to 30 mg/kg i.v. had little effect on the spontaneous movement, hexobarbital-induced hypnosis, reserpine-induced hypothermia and motor coordination in mice. The drug showed neither anticonvulsant nor analgesic actions in mice. Furthermore, it had no effect on the spontaneous EEG, sleep-wakefulness cycle and EEG arousal response in rabbits at doses up to 10 mg/kg intravenously.
   2. The somatic nervous system: BTS 53 554 induced no muscle relaxation in mice and exerted no local anesthetic action in guinea pigs by corneal reflex method In addition, it had little effect on the neuromuscular transmission in cats.
   3. The autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle: BTS 53 554 showed no effect on the sympathetic ganglionic transmission in cats. In isolated smooth muscles, at doses up to 10(-3) Mol/l it showed little effect on the acetylcholine- or barium chloride-induced contraction of guinea-pig ileum, norepinephrine-induced contraction of rat vas deferens or oxytocin-induced contraction of non-pregnant rat uterus. However, it inhibited non-competitively norepinephrine-induced contraction of isolated rat aorta at 10(-4) mol/l or more and serotonin-induced contraction of isolated rat fundus at 3 x 10(-4) mol/l or more In the isolated guinea-pig ileum, the drug slightly inhibited the histamine-induced maximal contraction at 10(-3) mol/l. These results suggest BTS 53 554 had no specific effect on norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine or histamine. The drug relaxed isolated guinea-pig trachea at 3 X 10(-5) mol/l or more and inhibited the spontaneous movement of isolated pregnant rat uterus at 10(-4) Mol/l or more, although these actions were extremely weaker than those of isoproterenol (isoprenaline). BTS 53 554 also showed a slight inhibition of uterus movement in anesthetized rats at 30 mg/kg intravenously.
   4. The digestive system: BTS 53 554 tended to inhibit the gastrointestinal propulsion in mice and showed a slight inhibition of gastric and intestinal motilities in rats at 10 mg/kg intravenously. In isolated rabbit ileum, the drug slightly inhibited the spontaneous movement at 3 x 10(-3) mol/l.  For the gastric secretion in rats, BTS 53 554 at 30 mg/kg i.v. tended to inhibit the secretion, however, the drug increased the pancreatic juice secretion in dogs at 3 and 10 mg/kg intravenously.  It showed no effect on the bile secretion in dogs.
   5.  Other properties:  BTS 53 554 at 30 mg/kg i.v. decreased the urine volume and urinary excretion of electrolytes (Na+ and Cl-) in rats.  However, it had little effect on the carrageenin-induced edema and the blood coagulation system and did not show hemolytic and local irritative actions.
   These results suggested BTS 53 554 had little effect on the central and peripheral nervous systems, digestive system and peripheral organs except for its vascular and tracheal smooth muscle relaxant actions and secreto-motor activity on pancreatic juice.

AB This study tested the hypothesis that changes in photoperiod alter plasma catecholamine concentrations in the rhesus monkey during late gestation, Twelve chronically catheterized pregnant rhesus macaques were acclimated to a 12-h photoperiod (lights-on, 0700-1900 h). Under the control L:D cycle, blood samples were collected at 3-h intervals over 24 h for catecholamine analysis. Plasma concentrations (mean +/- SEM, pg/ml) ranged from 678 +/- 90 to 928 +/- 142 for norepinephrine; 230 +/- 22 to 631 +/- 141 for epinephrine; and 282 +/- 70 to 1090 +/- 362 for dopamine. A diurnal rhythm was observed in epinephrine with peak concentrations during tights-on (0900-1800 h; p < 0.05, compared to lights-off). After the first sampling protocol, the animals were divided equally between two groups: phase shift, in which tights-on was shifted 11 h (2000-0800 h) and constant light, with lights on continuously. After the phase shift, a parallel shift in the plasma epinephrine rhythm was noted, with peak levels observed between 2200 and 0700 h (p < 0.05). Constant light abolished the rhythm in epinephrine, with an overall reduction in mean basal levels of all three catecholamines. Daily melatonin infusions (0.2 mug/kg/h, 1900-0630 h) under constant light failed to restore the epinephrine rhythm or to return basal catecholamine concentrations to control photoperiod levels. These data suggest that photoperiod entrains the rhythm in epinephrine secretion, but the rhythm is ablated under constant conditions. Further, melatonin does not appear to play a role in the regulation of catecholamine secretion in the pregnant rhesus macaque.

AB To investigate the effects of bilateral cervical vagotomy on arousal and breathing responses, we studied eight sham-operated and eight chronically instrumented unanesthetized vagotomized sheep fetuses between 136 and 144 days of gestation (term approximately 147 days). Each fetus was instrumented to record sleep states, diaphragmatic electromyogram, blood pressure, pH, and blood gas tensions. In a randomized order, fetal lungs were distended with four different O2 concentrations: 0 (100% N2), 21, 50, and 100% at a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cmH2O via an in situ Y-endotracheal tube. Under control conditions, inspiratory time and the duration of the single longest breathing episode decreased from 598 +/- 99 (SD) ms and 24 +/- 10 min in sham group to 393 +/- 162 ms and 11.0 +/- 3.0 min in vagotomized group (P = 0.04 and 0.033), respectively. In response to lung distension with 100% N2, breathing time decreased from 44 +/- 17 to 20 +/- 18% (P = 0.045) in sham-operated fetuses, whereas it remained unchanged in the vagotomized group. In response to 100% O2, fetal arterial Po2 increased in five of eight fetuses sham-operated from 18.2 +/- 5.1 to 227 +/- 45 Torr (P < 0.0001) and in six of eight vagotomized fetuses from 18.5 +/- 4.4 to 172 +/- 39 Torr (P < 0.001). Although arousal was observed in all oxygenated fetuses at the onset of breathing, the duration of arousal was markedly attenuated in vagotomized fetuses (14 +/- 10 vs. 46 +/- 29 min in sham group; P = 0.024). Frequency and amplitude of breathing and respiratory output (frequency X amplitude) increased only in sham group (P = 0.02, 0.004, and 0.0002, respectively). We conclude that in response to lung distension and oxygenation, arousal and stimulation of breathing during active and quiet sleep are critically dependent on intact vagal nerves.

AB Noninvasive 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement was performed in 17 normotensive and 19 preeclamptic pregnant women. The normotensive women showed a significant decline of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the night. In contrast, preeclamptic women demonstrated an attenuated circadian rhythm or no circadian rhythm at all. This result was even more pronounced in patients with severe hypertension, some of whom had a nocturnal increase in blood pressure despite antihypertensive drugs given in an evening dose. The lack of nocturnal blood pressure decrease was still detectable 24 hours post partum. These results reveal that preeclamptic women are endangered by hypertensive emergencies mostly during the night. As a result of this, blood pressure controls should be extended into the night, and antihypertensive drugs should also be given in a sufficient evening dose.

   PRESSURE MONITORING; RECOGNITION OF MILD INCREASES OF BLOOD PRESSURE
   DURING PREGNANCY; REDUCTION OF PROTEINURIA; NORMOTENSIVE PREGNANCY;
   CRITERIA OF NORMOTENSION IN PREGNANCY
AB The clinical course of two patients with diabetic risk-pregnancy shows the advantages of 24-hour ambulatory blood-pressure-monitoring: In the first patient with overt diabetic nephropathy and nephrotic-range proteinuria (White-class F) weekly controls of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring gives an early indication for antihypertensive therapy, which results in extraordinary reduction of proteinuria. In the third trimester 24-hour blood pressure monitoring leads to an additional criterion for early delivery because of a modest, but definite increase in blood pressure with worsening clinical symptoms. The requirement for antihypertensive therapy and the increase in blood pressure during third trimester could not be derived from multiple casual blood pressure readings per day. The second patient had no diabetic complications (White-class C) and showed normotensive values in 24-hour blood pressure monitoring and a nadir of blood pressure in the 23rd week of pregnancy. Not only a reduced circadian rhythm, but also the close and precise recognition of minor persistent increases of blood pressure result in improved early recognition of preeclampsia in this group of high-risc pregnant patients.

AB The existence of an activatable dopamine system within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the site of a biological clock, was investigated in rats during fetal life. In situ hybridization studies revealed that D1-dopamine receptor mRNA was highly expressed in the fetal SCN and not expressed in other hypothalamic regions. Cocaine injected into pregnant rats or directly into rat fetuses on day 20 of gestation selectively activated c-fos gene expression in the fetal SCN; cocaine did not induce c-fos expression elsewhere in the fetal brain or in the maternal SCN. This cocaine-induced activation of c-fos expression in fetal SCN was mediated in part through D1-dopamine receptors, as the cocaine-induced activation was partially blocked by the D1-dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390. In addition, the selective D1-dopamine receptor agonist SKF 38393 induced high levels of c-fos expression in the fetal SCN. The presence of an activatable dopamine system within the fetal SCN provides a mechanism through which maternal signals could entrain the fetal biological clock and through which maternally administered psychotropic drugs could alter normal development of the circadian timing system.

AB Continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep studies were obtained on healthy full-term and preterm infants at matched conceptional ages. Studies were recorded under environmentally controlled conditions. Eighteen healthy preterm infants were matched to 18 full-term infants based on conceptional age, sex, race and socioeconomic class. The initial 3 hours of a 12-hour recording were simultaneously recorded on paper and computer. The visually scored data based on the paper recordings for sleep architecture and continuity measures were studied. Differences in each sleep organization for the preterm infants included the following: a longer ultradian sleep cycle (70 minutes vs. 53 minutes, p = 0.02) was noted. More abundant trace alternant (34% vs. 28%, p = 0.02) and less abundant low-voltage irregular active sleep (13% vs. 17%, p = 0.05) were noted. Although no differences were observed for sleep latency and efficiency, the preterm infants had fewer numbers and shorter durations of arousals, fewer body movements and rapid eye movement (REM) (p < 0.0 1), particularly during quiet sleep. The extrauterine experience or the earlier birth of the preterm infant may influence specific sleep architecture and continuity measures when compared with the sleep of full-term infants who experienced a complete intrauterine gestation.

AB We conducted a longitudinal polysomnographic study in five healthy primiparous subjects, whose sleep was first recorded between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation, then every 2 months until parturition and at 1 month postpartum. The first 6 hours of sleep were used for statistical analysis. In contrast to previous studies, we found no reduction in stage 4 sleep with pregnancy. Slow-wave sleep (comprising stages 3 and 4), was significantly higher at 27-39 weeks of gestation than at 8-16 weeks, as predicted by the restorative theory of sleep. There was no significant difference in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time. When compared to a group of normal ovulating women, however, REM sleep time decreased during the last two months of pregnancy and, although there was no change in sleep onset latency, the time spent awake during the first six hours of sleep was increased. Future research into the effects of cortisol and progesterone is indicated.

AB Obstetric anesthesia has been the object of public interest and patient advocacy from its introduction in the 1840s to the present. Early arguments concerned the significance of pain in childbearing and became a popular issue involving physicians, clergymen, and journalists. The first obstetric anesthesia, ether, given in the United States was administered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1847. For the next several decades general anesthesia was the only feasible means of relieving labor pain. At the turn of the century a combination of scopolamine and morphine was introduced in the United States by a popular women's magazine; the National Twilight Sleep Association was launched. After the decline of this movement, the "natural' childbirth method came into national prominence. In spite of their differing pharmacologic characteristics, there are sociologic parallels between the patient advocacy of Twilight Sleep and that of psychoprophylaxis. This study focuses on the public perception of these movements, which were begun by physicians and subsequently endorsed by militant lay groups.

AB 1. This study examines the effect of chronic cold exposure during pregnancy. induced by winter shearing twin-bearing ewes 4 weeks before predicted lambing date. on O2 consumption and CO2 production during non-rapid-eve-movement (REM) sleep in lambs maintained for at least 1 h at warm (28-18-degrees-C) and cold (14-5-degrees-C) ambient temperatures at 1, 4, 14 and 30 days of age. This was combined with measurement of the thermogenic activity (GDP binding to uncoupling protein in mitochondrial preparations) of perirenal adipose tissue from lambs immediately after birth and at 33 days of age.
   2. Lambs born from shorn (cold-exposed) ewes were 15 % heavier (P < 0.01) and possessed 21 % (P < 0.01) more perirenal adipose tissue that contained 40 % more protein and mitochondrial protein than unshorn (P < 0.05) controls. Total GDP binding in perirenal adipose tissue was 40 % greater (P < 0.05) in lambs born from shorn ewes but there was no difference in lipid content of this tissue between the two groups.
   3. At 1 day of age, lambs born from shorn ewes exhibited a 16 % higher (P < 0.05) rate of O2 consumption (per kilogram bodyweight) at the warm temperature and a 40 % greater metabolic response to the cold ambient temperature. All lambs born from shorn ewes responded to cold exposure without shivering (i.e. via non-shivering thermogenesis) whilst shivering was measured in four out of seven lambs in the unshorn group. These differences had disappeared by 4 days of age as a result of a 25 % increased (P < 0.01) rate of O2 consumption in the warm in lambs born from unshorn ewes and a 20 % decrease (P < 0.05) in the response to the cold in lambs from shorn ewes. Shivering during cold exposure was measured in six out, of nine lambs born from shorn ewes indicating a rapid alteration in thermoregulatory responses to cold during the first few days of life. 4. The levels of GDP binding and mitochondrial protein in perirenal adipose tissue fell by one-third in both groups of lambs during the first 33 days of life whereas lipid content either increased or was unchanged. This indicated that brown adipose tissue (BAT) was developing the characteristics of white adipose tissue. In lambs aged 33 days that were born from shorn ewes, perirenal adipose tissue weighed 88 % more (P < 0.01), contained more (P < 0.05) protein and lipid, and the level of total GDP binding to mitochondrial protein was 100 % greater than in lambs born from unshorn ewes. There were no differences at this age between the two groups of lambs in metabolic rate but four out of eight lambs born from shorn ewes exhibited shivering responses to a cold ambient temperature compared with seven out of eight in the unshorn group.
   5. It is concluded that maternal cold exposure during late pregnancy stimulates fetal growth and the thermogenic activity of BAT in the neonatal lamb. At 1 day of age this alternation in BAT was associated with an increased metabolic response to cold achieved entirely via non-shivering thermogenesis while longer term consequences were apparent in the measurement of colonic temperature, number of lambs exhibiting shivering at cold temperatures and perirenal fat deposition.

AB Mechanisms for the control of episodic fetal breathing movements or the onset of continuous breathing at birth remain unknown. Lung distension with 100% O2 at a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cm H2O may induce arousal and continuous breathing. To investigate 1) the threshold range of arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) for the onset of arousal and breathing and 2) the graded response of breathing to various levels of PaO2, we studied 10 fetal sheep between 135 and 142 d of gestation (term = 147 +/- 2 d). Each fetus was instrumented to record sleep states, diaphragmatic electromyogram, arterial pH, and blood gas tensions. PaO2 threshold was determined through an indwelling O2 sensor catheter. Fetal lungs were distended at a continuous positive airway pressure of 40 CM H2O with 100% N2 or with O2 ranging from 40 to 100% via an in situ endotracheal tube. At the onset of arousal (n = 10), PaO2, arterial carbon dioxide tension, and Hb O2 saturation increased from control values of 21.7 +/- 0.75 torr (2.9 +/- 0.09 kPa), 41.8 +/- 1.1 torr (5.47 +/- 0.15 kPa), and 52.9 +/- 2.6% to 65.6 +/- 9.6 torr (8.74 +/- 1.28 kPa), 46.9 +/- 1.3 torr (6.25 +/- 0.17 kPa), and 92.9 +/- 2.06%, respectively, whereas the pH decreased from 7.31 +/- 0.006 to 7.27 +/- 0.009 (mean +/- SEM; p = 0.001, 0.04, 0.002, and 0.001, respectively). Seven of 10 fetuses breathed continuously. In these fetuses, PaO2 and arterial carbon dioxide tension further increased and pH decreased; however, no further significant increase in Hb O2 saturation was observed. Breathing stopped at a PaO2 of 38.5 +/- 9.5 torr (5.1 +/- 1.3 kPa) but could be restarted by increasing the PaO2. In response to an increase in fetal PaO2 (30-60 torr; 4-8 kPa), amplitude of breathing and total respiratory output significantly increased from the control values. Further increases in PaO2 or Hb O2 saturation did not significantly affect the respiratory output. Hb O2 saturation and arterial pH had the most confounding effects on frequency and amplitude of breathing, respectively. Among the various sleep states, arousal had the most profound effects on respiratory output. We conclude that 1) very high levels of PaO2 are not necessary to initiate arousal and continuous breathing and 2) further increments in Hb O2 saturation above the threshold level have no significant effect on breathing responses.

LA English
DT Article
ID GLYCEMIC CONTROL; ORGANOGENESIS; CARE
AB OBJECTIVE - To evaluate the incidence and predisposing factors of severe hypoglycemia (SH) in pregnant women with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - SH (impairment of consciousness due to hypoglycemia subsequently treated with glucagon or i.v. glucose) was recorded in all pregnant type I diabetic women (n = 77) who attended our pregnancy clinic during 85 pregnancies from 1986 to 1990.
   RESULTS - Ninety-four SHs were reported during 35 pregnancies. Of 94 SHs, 84% occurred before the 20th gestational wk (median 12th wk) and 77% during sleep. In the group with SH, there was no permanent maternal sequelae, and there was a favorable fetal outcome (no perinatal death and no congenital malformation). Mean HbA1c values were not different between the group with and without SH for the first half (6.4 +/- 1.1 vs. 6.3 +/- 0.9%) and 2nd half (5.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.7%) of pregnancy. The percentage of women with SH before pregnancy (51 vs. 28%, P < 0.05) and the incidence of SH patients before pregnancy (0.49 vs. 0.08 SH/patient/yr) was different between the group with and without SH.
   CONCLUSIONS - SH is frequent during pregnancies of type I diabetic women with near normoglycemia. The risk for SH is particularly pronounced during the first half of pregnancy and in women with a history of SH.

ID GOLDEN-HAMSTER; BEHAVIOR; TIME; RATS
AB The effects of mating time and of LD cycles on the timing of birth and length of gestation were examined in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Hamsters maintained on 14L:10D cycles were mated for 2 h either in the evening or in the morning, and groups of hamsters mated in the morning were subjected to either a 6-h advance shift or a 6-h delay shift of the LD cycle on Days 5-14 of gestation. For the last 2 days of gestation the hamsters were kept in constant dim light and observed every hour to determine the time of birth. Hamsters mated in the evening gave birth an average of 4.8 h before those mated in the morning, and the hamsters subjected to an advance shift gave birth an average of 8.1 h before those subjected to delay shift. The results show that 80-100% of births occur during the subjective day on Day 16 of gestation and that the minimum duration of gestation is 15 days and 2 h. The regulation of birth appears to involve two processes, an interval timer related to the time of conception and a circadian rhythm that is governed by the LD cycle.

LA English
DT Article
ID ALCOHOL EXPOSURE; TERATOGENESIS; RATS; RESPONSES; BEHAVIOR; ONTOGENY
AB Sensitivity to alcohol may influence the severity of prenatal alcohol effects. To examine this hypothesis, the ontogeny of thermoregulation was measured in prenatal ethanol exposed offspring of mice selected for differences in alcohol sensitivity. Pregnant long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice were exposed to 3 or 4 g/kg ethanol or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin twice per day from day 7 through 18 of pregnancy. Doses were given six hours apart via gavage. Nonintubated lab chow controls were included for both genotypes. Offspring were fostered at birth to lactating mice of an outbred strain. Offspring temperatures were measured at 0, 60, and 120 min away from the nest on alternating days from 7 through 21 days of age. LS and SS offspring prenatally exposed to the high ethanol dose showed lower temperatures at the 60 and 120 min time points on each day of testing compared to all other treatment groups. Temperatures of offspring prenatally exposed to the low ethanol dose did not differ from controls. These results suggest a relatively steep dose-response curve for thermoregulatory deficits in LS and SS offspring prenatally exposed to alcohol. Genetically-based alcohol sensitivity did not influence the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on this response.

AB Fetal heart rate (FHR) characteristics of fetuses exposed and not exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were studied. FHR is considered to reflect central nervous system (CNS) integrity. Three intervals during pregnancy were investigated: 20, 32, and 38 weeks. At 32 and 38 weeks, FHR was studied in relation to quiet (C1F) and active (C2F) sleep periods. For each tracing, a baseline was determined and accelerations and decelerations were identified. To assess FHR variability, the long-term irregularity, interval difference and absolute beat-to-beat indexes, and the bandwidth were calculated for 30-s intervals between accelerations and decelerations. No marked differences were noted between study and control groups concerning basal FHR and the occurrence of accelerations. For FHR derived from the fetal ECG, all indexes of FHR variability and the bandwidth were lower for the study group as compared with the control group, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. Our study shows that chronic prenatal exposure to AEDs does not seriously interfere with modulation of fetal heart rhythm by the CNS.

AB To investigate the role of the retino-hypothalamic tract on fetal prolactin regulation, we examined the effect of ocular enucleation on fetal plasma prolactin. Eleven fetuses of Suffolk ewes were chronically catheterized during fall, and six of them were subjected to bilateral ocular enucleation. All ewes were kept at 12h:12h light:dark cycle (lights on at 0800 and off at 2000). The experiments were performed 5-9 days after surgery (GA control fetuses 125 +/- 1.5, optical enucleation 121.3 +/- 1.5 days). Blood samples were taken from fetuses hourly around the clock, and plasma prolactin and cortisol were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Luteinizing hormone (LH) and Growth hormone (GH) were measured in pooled plasma samples from control and enucleated fetuses by RIA.
   Average plasma prolactin was 5-fold lower in enucleated than in control fetuses (9.6 +/- 0.5 and 54.2 +/- 3.3 ng/ml, SEM; P<0.005). Both control and enucleated fetuses presented circadian rhythm of prolactin with acrophase between 1400 and 1830 h. An enucleated fetus was tested for response of prolactin to TRH. Prolactin increased as described in the literature. There was no change in plasma concentration of cortisol, LH or GH after ocular enucleation. Our data indicate that the optical pathway participates in prolactin regulation in the fetal sheep.

AB Twenty-four-hour energy expenditure (EE), daily and sleeping EE, and the energy cost of a standardized treadmill exercise were assessed in a respiration chamber in 41 young pregnant Gambian women at 12 (n = 11), 24 (n = 15), nd 36 (n = 15) wk of gestation and compared with 13 nonpregnant nonlactating (NPNL) control women. The rate of 24-h EE was significantly higher (P < 0.001) at 36 wk gestation (8443 +/- 243 kJ/d) than in the NPNL group (6971 +/- 172 kJ/d) or at 12 and 24 wk (7088 +/- 222 and 7188 +/- 192 kJ/d, respectively). Per unit body weight, no more differences in 24-h EE, daily and sleeping EE, or energy cost of walking were observed between pregnant and NPNL women. There was no statistical difference in the 24-h respiratory quotient among the groups. We conclude that the state of pregnancy in Gambian women induces a progressive rise in 24-h EE, which becomes significant in the third trimester and is proportional to body weight.

AB Objective. - To evaluate cerebral cortical function with electroencephalography in infants of cocaine-addicted mothers.
   Design. - Patient series.
   Setting. - The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Pa).
   Participants. - Thirty-five consecutive infants of cocaine-addicted mothers hospitalized for a comprehensive health assessment and 51 healthy, age-matched infants studied with electroencephalography and respiratory thermistor because they were siblings of sudden infant death victims (comparison group).
   Interventions. - None.
   Measurements/Main Results. - Behavioral states during spontaneous daytime sleep were classified as active sleep or quiet sleep; quiet sleep was further characterized as immature, trace alternant sleep or mature, continuous, slow wave sleep. No episodes of ictal apnea or nonictal apnea were recorded in infants of cocaine-addicted mothers; nonictal apnea was observed in one control patient. No electrographic seizures were recorded. There were no significant differences between the proportions of infants exposed to cocaine in utero and that of controls who displayed excessive sharp electroencephalographic transients, background abnormalities, immaturity, and hypermaturity. Electroclinical sleep discordance was present in 5.7% of infants of cocaine-addicted mothers vs 0% of controls. Cocaine-exposed infants displayed mature, continuous, slow wave sleep below 45 weeks of conceptional age in a significantly higher percentage than those in the comparison group.
   Conclusions. - Although frank electroencephalographic abnormalities were infrequent in infants whose mothers were addicted to cocaine, they differed significantly in their younger age of onset of continuous, slow wave sleep. Our findings provide continued reason for concern that infants of cocaine-addicted mothers may suffer subtle adverse neurologic, cognitive, or behavioral effects later in life. The longitudinal assessment of sleep disturbance and its relation to later development might permit tracking of the long-term effects of prenatal exposure to cocaine.

AB We observed fetal behavior by using three ultrasonic real-time scanners simultaneously in 30 normal pregnant women between 20 and 40 weeks of gestation and analyzed developmental changes in behavioral pattern focussing the attention on the characteristics of REM and non-REM sleep and wakeful state. The frequency of REM significantly increased with gestational age, and its occurrences formed a group in late pregnancy. REM and non-REM periods, which were defined as the phase with uninterrupted appearance of rapid eye movements and the phase without them over 3 min, respectively, became clearly distinguishable between 28 and 31 weeks of gestation. The correlation between the occurrence of rapid eye movements and breathing movements was high after 27 weeks. These results demonstrate the course of the development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in the human fetus.

AB Twelve women in their third trimester of pregnancy and 10 age-matched nonpregnant controls underwent complete polysomnography for one night in the laboratory. Seven of the original women returned for a second study 3-5 months postpartum. During late pregnancy, women showed increased wake after sleep onset (WASO) and a lower sleep efficiency in comparison with the control group. The percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was significantly decreased and the percentage of stage 1 significantly increased compared to the nonpregnant group. At 3-5 months postpartum, a significant reduction in WASO and increased sleep efficiency were noted. However, only a slight increase was noted in REM sleep during the postpartum period compared to the prepartum period. The most frequent sleep complaints in the pregnant group were restless sleep, low back pain, leg cramps and frightening dreams. In summary, in accordance with their complaints, women in their third trimester demonstrated polysomnographic patterns of sleep maintenance insomnia.

AB The 24-h activity patterns of various enzymes were determined in human serum, red blood cells and white blood cells of maternal and umbilical cord blood. Blood was drawn from the brachial vein of mothers and from the umbilical cord within ten minutes after delivery. Corresponding blood specimens were obtained from 83 spontaneous labors, occurring at different hours over a period of 60 days. For each variable (variable = activity of a specific enzyme in one of the blood components) the results were grouped according to delivery hour, forming a 24-h pattern which was analyzed to elucidate time dependency. Five out of six corresponding maternal and fetal variables were similar with regard to pattern and peak time. The activity rhythms of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glucose phosphate isomerase in red blood cells of mothers and fetuses possessed a significant bimodal pattern. The activity rhythms of the latter enzyme in white blood cells and sera exhibited a significant 24-h period. Hexosaminidase activity exhibited a distinct 24-h rhythm in maternal white blood cells, but no significant rhythm could be detected in the fetal white blood cells. The activity of hexosaminidase showed, identical 24-h patterns in maternal and cord serum when analyzed by best fit cosine, and no significant time-dependency when analyzed by ANOVA.

AB The circadian rhythm of alpha-amylase, E.C. 3.2.1.1. (alpha-1,4-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase) in the parotid glands of 25-day-old rats were studied under different experimental designs (fasting, reversed photoperiod, constant lighting conditions and treatment with reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine). The rhythm of fasted rats did not change. There were modifications in the rhythm of rats submitted to a reversed photoperiod or treated with reserpine or alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. The rhythm was present, with changes in the acrophase, in parotids of rats kept during their gestation and postnatal life in constant light or dark. Results suggest that the circadian rhythm of alpha-amylase in parotid gland of young rats is endogenous, synchronized by the photoperiod, and with maternal coordination.

TI CONTEMPORARY RISK-FACTORS FOR SUDDEN INFANT DEATH IN AN IRISH POPULATION
   - A CASE CONTROL STUDY
SO IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE

DT Article
AB This case-controlled study examines some recently implicated risk factors for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (S.I.D.S.) in Irish infants. Irish S.I.D.S. infants are lighter at birth than controls (3463g) compared to (3542g) and boys out-number girls by a ratio of 1.3:1 S.I.D.S. infants are more frequently: breast-fed (42 % vs 25 %) and sleep in a location other than the parent's bedroom (54 % vs 21 %), but start solids at a similar age and appear not to be sicker prior to death than the control group. This study highlights the frequency of symptoms of possible ill-health (i.e. snuffles and being "chesty") in well infants during the first months of life with 32% of the control group having snuffles and 35 % described as "chesty". In addition these symptoms are frequently treated with antibiotics with 31 % of the control group having already received antibiotics by 2 months of age.
   A majority of S.I.D.S. infants were described as cold when found (52 %) with 39 % described as warm and 15 % as sweaty. Obviously the recently implicated role of overheating may be relevant in the latter 15 % of S.I.D.S. cases. In this series, 88 % of infants had died by 6 months of age. Of the 97 parents of S.I.D.S infants questioned, 78 had subsequently become pregnant by the time the study was conducted at an average time of 5 months post the S.I.D.S event.

AB This prospective study of 63 women was designed to investigate the relationship between sleep disruption prior to the birth, during labour and in the early postpartum period and the subsequent development of the postnatal blues. The results from this preliminary study suggest that two factors: (a) a night-time labour; and (b) a history of sleep disruption in the latter stages of pregnancy, may have aetiological importance in the development of postnatal blues. There was little evidence from this study to suggest that sleep disruption on the nights following the birth. the third sleep factor investigated, had any impact on the expression of the blues.

AB We developed a rebreathing system for measuring response to carbon dioxide (CO2) of newborns and infants for use at the bedside. The system based on Read's method is small, easy to operate, and includes a computer-controlled gas switching sequence, computerized calculation, and display functions.
   We measured the CO2 response in 11 infants with or without apnea, who were born at 26-33 weeks gestation and were 12 to 215 days old at the time of the study. Our results suggest that the presence of apnea in premature infants may correspond to a low CO2 response. The method was convenient for clinical use because it allowed an investigator to carry out bedside tests in only a few minutes. With our system we were able to assess respiratory center function in newborns and infants.

AB During evaluation for palpitations, presyncope, or syncope, seven pregnant women had documented ventricular tachycardia.  Before pregnancy none had a history of significant cardiac disease or symptomatic arrhythmia.  The tachycardia rate ranged from 117 to 250 beats/min and lasted up to 65 seconds.  Arrhythmia evaluation in five of the patients suggested catecholamine-sensitive ventricular tachycardia.  This diagnosis was supported by either a positive relation to exercise or isoproterenol infusion, suppression of arrhythmia by beta-blockade or sleep, and lack of induction of arrhythmia by programmed electrical stimulation of the heart.  The arrhythmias resolved in one patient soon after evaluation and in one other patient after 2 months of controlling therapy.  Five other patients continued to receive therapy throughout pregnancy.  Delivery was accomplished in all patients without significant maternal or neonatal complications.

AB Spontaneous, long lasting epochs of myometrial contractility, contractures, occur throughout the majority of pregnancy in sheep. Contractures are temporally related to a switch in fetal electroencephalogram (ECoG) patterns from low to high voltage. In late gestation, fetal ECoG increases in voltage. We have previously suggested that contractures may influence fetal ECoG maturation. In the present study, we hypothesized that a sustained increase in the frequency of myometrial contractures in pregnant sheep at 120-140 days gestation would accelerate maturation of the fetal ECoG. Five pregnant ewes were pulsed with coxytocin 600 muU.kg-1.min-1 intravenously for five minutes in every 30 minutes from 127.8 +/- 1.5 days gestational age for a minimum of six days. Six control ewes received pulses of saline. Fetuses of all eleven ewes were instrumented with bilateral electrodes to record fetal ECoG and nuchal muscle activity. Fetal high voltage (HV) ECoG increased in amplitude in both groups but the rate of increase was faster in the fetuses of ewes receiving oxytocin. There were no differences between the two groups in the duration of HV ECoG. The percentage increase in the amount of time the fetal nuchal muscles were active compared with the baseline day before infusion was only significant in the oxytocin infused group on the first day of oxytocin infusion. These findings support the hypothesis that myometrial activity during pregnancy has the capacity to influence fetal neural development.

AB Increased women in the work force and requirements for maximal employee productivity have necessitated examination of the optimal time for parturients to resume normal activities.  This prospective study was designed to determine whether prepregnancy measures of aerobic capacity are regained by 4-8 wk postpartum.  Weight, percent body fat, recall energy expenditure, and exercise responses via a stage 1, graded cycle ergometer exercise test were determined in 11 subjects (mean age = 27.56 +/- 2.2) in a postabsorptive state prior to pregnancy and 4-8 wk postpartum.  Subject characteristics were compared by the Student's t-test and differences across workloads and time by analysis of variance with repeated measures.  Prepregnant weight (mean = 58.80 +/- 7.26 kg) was significantly less (P < 0.05) than postpartum weight (mean = 62.81 +/- 9.12 kg), and prepregnant energy expenditure (1352 +/- 453 kJ) per day was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the postpartum period (274 +/- 333 kJ).  Maximal oxygen uptake was significantly higher (35.2 +/- 0.7 vs 30.5 +/- 2.0 ml.kg.-1min-1) in the prepregnant as compared with the postpartum period.  Further, heart rate at 125 and 150 W was significantly lower prepregnancy as compared with postpregnancy.  Results support a detraining effect in the early postpartum period.  Whether this detraining is an inevitable factor associated with pregnancy or whether exercising throughout pregnancy can ameliorate the decline in aerobic capacity postpartum is uncertain.

AB Eighteen non-pregnant woman complaining about insomnia were polysomnographically investigated for 3 nights with weekly intervals. They received placebo, 2 mg flunitrazepam or 10 mg zolpidem according to a cross-over double blind design. The patients were selected by general practitioners on the basis of subjective complaints. Zolpidem is a recently introduced short-acting imidazopyridine hypnotic, binding to a subunit of the benzodiazepine 1 receptor. Flunitrazepam is a well-known hypnotic, binding to both the benzodiazepine 1 and 2 receptor subtypes. Objective recording did not substantiate the subjective complaint of insomnia. Sleep patterns during placebo differed only little from that expected from age matched healthy persons. Both flunitrazepam and zolpidem significantly shortened sleep onset (5 min of continuous sleep beginning with NREM 1 sleep). The sleep composition following flunitrazepam was characterized by an increase in NREM 2, a prolongation of the time to REM sleep, a reduction of REM sleep and an increase in NREM 3-4 sleep during the first 2 h of sleep. The sleep composition following zolpidem resembled more that seen in persons without sleep complaints. However, as compared to placebo, there was a decrease of the time spent awake during sleep and an increase in NREM 3-4 during the first 2 of sleep.

AB Developmental changes in the continuity and stability of fetal breathing patterns were studied in 27 fetal lambs with chronically implanted electromyographic electrodes in the diaphragm throughout the third trimester (102-140 days).  The results showed that there was a progressive decrease in the incidence of fetal breathing movements throughout the third trimester (P < 0.001).  This reduction in incidence of fetal breathing movements was due, in part, to a 20% decrease in the total number of breathing bursts at approximately 125 days (P = 0.05).  The breathing patterns in both immature (< 120 days) and mature fetal lambs were fragmented by a large number of pauses (interburst interval 6-10 s) and apneas (interburst interval > 10 s).  Increase in gestational age was associated with a decrease in the number of pauses and apneas but longer apnea durations.  The breathing pattern in fetuses < 120 days old was more continuous than that in those > 120 days old, as demonstrated by significantly longer epoch durations (P = 0.013).  There was no significant change in the continuity of the breathing pattern after 120 days.  However, there was a significant increase in the stability of the instantaneous breathing rates throughout the third trimester.  This was indicated by a significant increase in the percent of breathing bursts that occurred in stable clusters (P = 0.046), the number of bursts per cluster (P = 0.013), and cluster duration (P = 0.018).  Thus an increase in stability appears to be the major developmental change in breathing control in late gestation.

ID DEATH-SYNDROME; APNEA; SLEEP
AB While many aspects related to the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death remain unclear, the ultimate trigger event appears to be an acute regulatory disturbance of the cardiorespiratory neurons of the reticular formation of the brain stem.  Retrospective studies have demonstrated that SIDS often occurs after infection of the upper respiratory tract.  We present the case history of a 10-week old infant, where the respiratory pattern demonstrated highly pathological alterations induced by a mild infection of the upper airways, as confirmed by oxycardiorespirography.  Oxycardiorespirography provides continuous recording of the respiration (transthoracic impedence) extending over several hours during sleep and during the critical phase just before going to sleep and waking up in relation to heart rate, partial oxygen pressure (measured transcutaneously) and nasal flow.  The presented infant is a premature infant delivered in the 34th week of gestation according to Dubowitz (artificial respiration for 7 days due to hyalin membrane syndrome stage II).  During infection periodic breathing was found to be 19,3% with partly severe hypoxemia.  The longest single episode of apnea was 30 seconds.  On the average, 5 episodes of bradycardia occurred (< 100/min/measuring hour).  An OCRG investigation performed at the age of 5 weeks and after disappearance of the infection at the age of 12 weeks yielded normal findings.  This permits the conclusion that in out patient an infection of the upper airways may have induced a pathologic respiratory pattern, which could be a major trigger mechanism for sudden infant death.

AB Noradrenaline neurotransmission becomes functional early in the development of the brain. Therefore, interference with this transmission by receptor agonists or antagonists, which are used clinically in various conditions in pregnancy, may alter brain development. Long-term biochemical, morphological, behavioural and electrophysiological effects have been reported after pre- or postnatal exposure of rats to adrenergic drugs, the alpha(2)-agonist clonidine and the beta-antagonist propranolol in particular, and are summarized here.

AB Periodic breathing (PB) is a pattern of breathing that is frequently recognized in infants being studied for possible sleep apnea. Infants presenting to a sleep laboratory over a 3 1/2-year period who had evidence on their initial study of prolonged (> 15% of total sleep time) PB were prospectively studied in an effort to determine the significance of this pattern of breathing. Of the 331 infants studied, 40 demonstrated prolonged PB. Sixteen of these infants, who were of 37 weeks' gestation or greater at birth and did not receive pharmacologic therapy, were studied on at least two occasions (group 1). Of the remaining 24 infants, 11 were treated with methylxanthines by their attending physician (group 2), and 13 did not return for sequential studies (group 3). All infants who were of less than 37 weeks' gestation at birth were separately evaluated (group 4). For group 1, who were studied at a mean age of 5 postnatal weeks, there was a mean of 36.4% periodicity which decreased on the second study to 18.0%. By the fourth study, this had decreased to 9.2%. In group 2, there was a mean of 41.3% periodicity during the first study which decreased to 6.4% on the second study. Infants of group 3 had a mean of 31.4% PB on their initial study and the premature infants, group 4, had 30.1% PB. All infants showed a decrease in PB with sequential studies and no infant was known to have died of sudden infant death syndrome or any other disorder in the first year of life. For the majority of infants, the abnormal duration of PB was the only abnormality noted on the sleep recording. The results suggest that excess PB as an isolated abnormality on a sleep recording is not an indicator of subsequent risk. Additional longitudinal evaluations of this respiratory pattern are needed.

AB The mechanism underlying diurnal variations in PAI-1 as well as the cellular origin of PAI-1 in subjects with high PAI-1 levels are unknown. We evaluated diurnal changes (8:00 am vs 4:00 pm) in PAI-1 (functional and immunological assays), t-PA Ag and t-PA/PAI-1 complex levels in controls and subjects with high PAI-1 levels. Three test groups were recruited among obese hyperinsulinemic subjects, emergency care unit patients with inflammatory syndrome or infection and pregnant women.
   The classical afternoon decrease of PAI-1 level was observed in controls and obese subjects but its amplitude was greater in the latter. The decrease in t-PA Ag and t-PA/PAI-1 complex levels was the same in controls and in obese. As, in previous studies, elevated PAI-I levels have been correlated with insulin resistance and a decrease in insulin sensibility has been described in the early morning, it is proposed that this "dawn phenomenon" could be implicated in the circadian variations of PAI-1 in controls and could be amplified in obese subjects. Great variability in PAI-1, t-PA Ag or t-PA/PAI-1 complex levels was observed in patients with acute inflammatory syndrome or infection for whom classical biorhythms are suppressed. No diurnal changes in PAI-1 and other fibrinolytic parameters were observed in patients with inflammatory syndrome or in pregnant women suggesting that other sources and/or other regulatory mechanisms of PAI-1 production are involved.

AB The relationships between self-reported assessments of the quality of the preoperative night's sleep, preoperative anxiety, and several biochemical and physiological indicators of stress reaction were investigated in pregnant women at term receiving no premedication (n = 15), a placebo tablet (n = 15), diazepam 5 mg p.o. (n = 15), or atropine 0.01 mg/kg i.m. (n = 15), in connection with spinal analgesia for elective caesarean section.  In the patients receiving no premedication, the subjective estimate of the quality of the preoperative night's sleep was negatively associated with concentrations of noradrenaline (NA) and its metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in CSF, and with plasma adrenaline.  The anxiolytic effect of diazepam was reflected as significantly lower plasma levels of another metabolite of NA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG).  Placebo and diazepam, and to a lesser extent atropine, confounded the statistical relationships between the clinical and biochemical responses found in the patients with no premedication.  On the whole, the biochemical monoamine measurements were of little use in determining the clinical effects of different kinds of premedicants.

AB Recently, investigators have reported an alteration of postnatal respiratory pattern, deficient hypoxic arousal from sleep, and an increased incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) among human infants exposed to cocaine prenatally, thus suggesting that prenatal cocaine exposure may perturb the maturation of respiratory control thereby increasing the risk for SIDS. To investigate the effects' of prenatal cocaine on postnatal respiration, we evaluated the ventilatory response to 0.21 FIO2 (baseline) and at 0.15, 0.10, and 0.08 FIO2 by the barometric method on days 4-5 of life in 23 New Zealand White rabbit pups born to cocaine-exposed (30 mg/kg/day of cocaine HCI by continuous subcutaneous infusion), pair-fed and free-fed does. The chamber pressure deflection (proportional to VT after appropriate calculation) was computer-sampled at 200 Hz when the unanesthetized pups were resting quietly with no gross body movements. Recording was made after 10 min acclimatization to a specific FIO2. We found that baseline ventilation did not differ significantly among study groups. However, minute ventilation (V(I)), inspiratory flow (V(T)/T(I)), tidal volume (V(T)), increased significantly with hypoxia to peak values at 0.08 FIO2 in pair-fed and free-fed pups but these measurements did not increase significantly in cocaine-exposed pups. Our finding of a deficient second phase of the hypoxic ventilatory response among cocaine-exposed pups supports the hypothesis that prenatal cocaine perturbs the maturation of respiratory control. It is likely that manipulation of dose, gestational timing, and route of prenatal cocaine exposure in an animal model will provide a useful tool to probe the maturation of control of breathing and potentially the pathogenic origin of SIDS.

AB Animal experiments have provided evidence for the presence of sex differences from the synaptic level up to behaviour. Although sex differences in the human brain may have been presumed implicitly since the days of Aristotle, research on the presence of functional and structural sex differences of the human brain started only relatively recently. The most conspicuous sex difference in the mammalian brain was described by Gorski et al. [1978] in the preoptic area (POA) of the rat hypothalamus. We found that the volume of a putative homologue of this sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) in the adult human hypothalamus was more than twice as large in men as in women and contained about twice as many cells. Recently a similar sex difference and volume has been described for the human bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and 'interstitial nuclei of the hypothalamus' (INAH). Sexual differentiation of the hypothalamus was generally believed to take place between 4 and 7 months of gestation. A life span study on the SDN of more than 100 subjects revealed. however, that only after the age of 2-4 years postnatally sexual differentiation becomes manifest by a decrease in volume and cell number in the female SDN. If sexual differentiation of the brain indeed takes place postnatally, not only chemical and hormonal factors may influence this process but also social factors A prominent theory on the development of sexual orientation is that it develops as a result of an interaction between the developing brain and sex hormones. According to Dorner's hypothesis, male homosexuals have a female differentiation of the hypothalamus. This hypothesis was not supported by our observations on the SDN. Neither the SDN volume nor the cell number in the hypothalamus of homosexual men differed from that of heterosexual men. However, a difference in SCN cell number was observed in relation to sexual orientation. The volume and cell number of the SCN of homosexual men was twice as large as that of a reference group. During development, the SCN volume and cell counts reach peak values around 13-16 months after birth. At this age the SCN contains about the same number of cells as the SCN of adult male homosexuals, whereas in the reference group the cell numbers subsequently decline to the adult value, which is about 35% of the peak value. The observation that an SCN similarly enlarged as that observed in homosexual men was present in a woman with Prader-Willi syndrome, a congenital LHRH deficiency in which sex hormones are very low, suggests that at some stage of brain development the interaction with sex hormones might be essential for the programmed SCN cell death.
   In conclusion, marked sex differences in the human hypothalamus are found in the SDN and BST, and an enlarged SCN is present in homosexual men. The functional implications of such differences in relation to gender and sexual orientation are, however, far from clear at the moment.

AB The pineal gland and melatonin exert a major influence in the control of brain electrical activity and have been shown to be involved in seizure and sleep mechanisms. Since pinealectomy has been reported to result in seizures in experimental animals, it is assumed that melatonin has anticonvulsant properties. Indeed, limited studies in humans with temporal lobe epilepsy indicate that melatonin attenuates seizure activity.
   In the present communication we present evidence, based on magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain measurements, that melatonin may exert proconvulsive activity in humans as well. The proconvulsive properties of melatonin may explain several phenomena associated with epilepsy such as the increased occurrence of seizures at night when melatonin plasma levels are 5 to 8-fold higher than during the day and the observed exacerbation of seizures premenstrually and during pregnancy as well as the attenuation of seizures in the menopause. Furthermore, our findings suggest that anticonvulsants which decrease melatonin secretion, such as the benzodiazepines, may exert their antiepileptic activity by attenuating nocturnal melatonin secretion. Finally, we propose that patients with nocturnal epilepsy or those experiencing exacerbation of seizures premenstrually may benefit from the administration of agents which block the secretion or action of melatonin.

AB New Zealand's high mortality rate from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) prompted the development of the New Zealand Cot Death Study. A report of the analysis of the data from the first year has been published. This report now gives the major identified risk factors from the full 3 year data set. In this case-control study there were 485 infants who died from SIDS in the post-neonatal age group, and 1800 control infants, who were a representative sample ot all hospital births in the study region. Obstetric records were examined and parental interviews were completed in 97.5% and 86.9% of subjects, respectively. As expected many risk factors for SIDS were confirmed including: lower socio-economic status, unmarried mother, young mother, younger school-leaving age of mother, younger age ot mother at first pregnancy, late attendance at antenatal clinic, non-attendance at antenatal classes, Maori, greater number of previous pregnancies, the further south the domicile, winter, low birthweight, short gestation, male infant and admission to a special care baby unit. In addition, however, we identified four risk factors that are potentially amenable to modification. These were the prone sleeping position of the baby (odds ratio (OR) = 3.70; 95% confidence interval (Cl) = 2.91, 4.70); bed sharing (OR = 2.70; 95% Cl = 2.02, 3.62); maternal smoking of 1-9 cigarettes per day (OR = 3.47; 95% Cl = 2.50, 4.83),10-19 cigarettes per day (OR = 3.94; 95% Cl = 2.87, 5.41) or more than 20 cigarettes per day (OR = 5.90; 95% Cl = 4.20, 8.31); and not breast feeding (OR = 2.39; 95% Cl = 1.88, 3.04). After controlling for all of the above variables, the relative risks associated with prone sleeping position (OR = 4.84), sharing bed (OR = 2.02), maternal smoking (OR = 1.79) and not breast feeding (OR = 1.89) were still statistically significant. Population-attributable risk calculations suggest that these four risk factors may account for 82% of deaths from SIDS. The SIDS mortality rate may fall to less than 0.7/1000 live births if all parents stop putting their infants down to sleep in the prone position, do not sleep with their baby, do not smoke, and breast feed their infants.

AB Serum osteocalcin (OC) was serially measured along an ovulatory menstrual cycle in 4 healthy unmedicated volunteers (age 33-38 years). During the study the women maintained their normal diet and daily physical activity. Starting at days 4-5 of the cycle, blood samples were taken between 09-11 AM every 2 or 3 days for OC, FSH, LH, E2 and P determinations. Daily ultrasound assessment of ovulation was performed in all subjects between days 7-18 of the cycle. Hormone determinations and OC were performed by RIA. While blood levels of FSH, LH, E2 and P changed during the cycle, according to the expected ovulatory pattern, serum OC concentrations remained stable during the cycle in each subject. In conclusion, serum OC is independent of the gonadotropin and ovarian steroid variations during the normal menstrual cycle.

AB Delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) colocalizes within gonadotropin-releasing-hormone (GnRH)-containing neurons in adult hypothalamus and could play a role in the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary axis in adults. To support the possibility that DSIP also participates in fetal neuroendocrine events and to demonstrate the ontogenic evidence of coexisting neuropeptides, we have performed a detailed immunocytochemical study of DSIP- and GnRH-immunoreactivity in fetal hypothalamus of guinea pig. Using indirect immunofluorescent and sequential double-immunolabeling (elution-restaining) techniques, the results indicated that DSIP immunoreactivity was initially detected at the 38th day of gestation. In contrast to the first appearence of GnRH immunoreactivity at day 28, therefore, a 10-day delay was found. Such a delay remains as yet unexplained. From its first occurrence, DSIP immunoreactivity was always labeled with GnRH, whereas some of GnRH-immunoreactive structures did not display a DSIP immunoreactivity. But with the growth of fetus, especially before and after birth, a complete overlap between DSIP and GnRH immunoreactivity was observed throughout various regions of hypothalamus. Attention was also focused on prenatal morphological development of DSIP/GnRH- and GnRH-immunolabeled neurons. Initially, labeled neurons were visualized as uni- or bipolar types. Thereafter, their smooth and irregular subtypes could be distinguished. During later fetal age, relatively mature features were evident such as the increase of multipolar and irregularly labeled neurons. Taken together, these data provide, for the first time, anatomical evidence that DSIP exists in fetal hypothalamus and that, like GnRH, it could regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary axis during ontogenesis.

AB This study was designed to determine the attitudes and compliance of working women toward methods being evaluated for use in the assessment of the effects of toxicants on reproductive potential. Women such as the highly motivated fertility patients and nurses, who are typically familiar with the methods and procedures of fertility assessment and the value of medical research, have been used to validate such methods in a clinical setting. However, the attitudes of a general working female population toward these methods are unknown. Nine participants were selected on the bases, in part, of not seeking fertility assistance, working full-time but not in the medical field, and having less than one year of college education. Attitudes were also evaluated for 193 nonparticipating women to whom the procedures had been verbally described. Participants measured basal body temperature and salivary and vaginal mucous electrical resistance, evaluated cervical mucus manually (CME), and collected the first morning urine for two menstrual cycles. Blood, saliva, and transvaginal ultrasonograms (US) were obtained at a fertility clinic 6 to 9 days per cycle. Participants brought urine to the laboratory every 3 days. All participants performed all methods. Participants were paid $400; nonparticipants were not compensated. Only 3% of the respondents objected to the proposed methods: principally to CME, US, and giving blood samples. No respondent perceived the study as unimportant. At the end of the study, participants judged US (50%), CME (20%), and saliva collection (20%) as "uncomfortable"; 20% of the participants were "reluctant" to perform the CME. More than 99% of samples were obtained, 82% at the correct time. Participants rated "contribution to science/society" (100%), "payment" (100%), and "interesting thing to do" (90%) as important reasons to participate. Results suggest that working women from a general population recognize the importance of occupational reproductive assessments and may serve as willing, compliant participants in such studies.

AB Fetal exposure to cocaine is associated with increased perinatal cardiac risk. Because cocaine promotes adrenergic actions, we assessed the effects of cocaine on development of cardiac adrenergic receptors and cell signaling in the rat. Pregnant rats were given 30 mg/kg s.c. of cocaine from gestational day 8 through 20 and the ontogenetic patterns of adrenergic receptor subtypes and their linkage to control of adenylate cyclase activity were assessed from birth to adulthood. Neonatal overexpression of alpha-2-receptors is required for maintenance of cardiac conduction during the hypoxia associated with birth or sleep apnea, and these receptors were present equally in both control and cocaine-exposed animals; the ontogenetic disappearance of alpha-2-receptors also was unaffected by drug exposure. Similarly, the acquisition of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors, their link to adenylate cyclase activity, and the development of adenylate cyclase catalytic units (assessed with forskolin) remained essentially normal despite fetal cocaine exposure. These results suggest that adverse effects on perinatal cardiac function associated with human maternal cocaine abuse either result from indirect actions of cocaine, such as cell damage caused by hypoxia/ischemia, or alternatively from primary contributions of covariables known to affect cardiac development, such as cigarette smoking.

DE PAN-TROGLODYTES; NOCTURNAL DELIVERY; CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS; PARTURITION;
   COLONY MANAGEMENT; STRESS
AB Most wild and captive nonhuman primates give birth nocturnally. Circadian rhythm mechanisms are a principal determinant of the nonrandom initiation of labor, but it has been suggested that the decreased human activity and increased seclusion over the weekend in laboratory primate colonies may result in an effect whereby births are confined mainly to the quiet periods. This study tests for such an effect in the tinting of 153 live, term births in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) housed in three institutions with various management practices. Eighty-four percent of births occurred nocturnally, and peak delivery time was between 2400 and 0700 hours. When the total number of births was examined, significantly fewer births occurred on Wednesdays and Thursdays, during the mid-week peak in colony activity, and significantly more births occurred on Sundays and Mondays. In facilities having marked alterations between weekday and weekend activity, significantly more births occurred Sunday and Monday. In the colonies where weekend and weekday surveillance and activity were similar, births were more evenly distributed throughout the week. These data suggest that parturition may be inhibited by routine colony activities that are perceived as stressful by some animals, and that the decreased activity and increased privacy on weekends may allow relaxation of parturient females, resulting in delivery during or immediately following the weekend. Colony managers should minimize colony activities that are potentially stressful to prepartal females in order to reduce risks to the fetus that may occur with delay or disruption of normal parturition.

Cause is unknown; sporadic occurrence is the rule.  Data presented in this review include the characteristics of pregnancy, growth and development, principal manifestations, radiographic and ophthalmological characteristics, and the results of cephalometric study.  Potential complications in the syndrome are related to the narrow upper airway associated with the craniofacial configuration.  Severe complications may include early pulmonary infection, respiratory embarrassment, obstructive sleep apnea, and anesthetic risk.  Topics for future study are suggested.

AB Six chronically catheterized rhesus macaques maintained on a 12-hour-light/dark cycle (lights on from 7 AM to 7 PM) showed a nocturnal uterine activity rhythm with peak contractile events between 9 and 11 PM (p < 0.05). In blood samples collected at 3-hour intervals over a 24-hour period, we determined that plasma melatonin and progesterone concentrations were elevated at night whereas estradiol, estrone, and cortisol reached peak concentrations in the early morning (p < 0.05). Lights were then left on for the remainder of the study. After 12 days in constant light, daily rhythms in uterine activity and plasma steriod levels were relatively unchanged, whereas melatonin concentrations were suppressed. Animals then received a timed infusion of melatonin (0.2 mg/kg/hr each day from 7 PM to 6 AM daily until delivery). The nocturnal uterine activity rhythm and the rhythms in plasma steroid concentrations were maintained. We conclude that the 24-hour patterns in maternal uterine activity and plasma steroid hormone levels are circadian rhythms generated by an endogenous biologic clock and do not appear to be driven by the pattern of melatonin in circulation.

AB Oral contraceptive use is influenced by multiple emotional factors. Physiological and psychological effects are closely correlated. Contraception may assist women in pursuing important psychosocial goals, on the other hand, it may cause a number of problems. Many unconscious wishes or fears may interfere with the clear separation of sexuality from fertility. Ambivalence about pregnancy, neurotic personalities and problems in partner relationship may cause psychic conflicts with regard to contraception. Anxiety, side effects, misuse of contraceptives or problems in the relationship between doctor and patient may result. As a further development psychosomatic symptoms such as discomfort, nervousness, sleep disturbance, fatigue, nausea and-sexual disorders may appear. The physician must take contradictory feelings of the patient into consideration, including her anxiety and her possible ambivalence with respect to pregnancy.

AB The serotonergic neurons of the mammalian brain comprise one of the most expansive chemical systems known. The cell bodies are largely confined to the midline (raphe) region of the brain stem in two general clusters: a superior group that consists of the dorsal raphe nucleus (B-7 and B-6), median raphe nucleus (B-8 and B-5), caudal linear nucleus (rostral B-8), and supralemniscal nucleus (B-9), and an inferior group that consists of nucleus raphe obscurus (B-2), nucleus raphe pallidus (B-1), nucleus raphe magnus (B-3), ventral lateral medulla (B-1/B-3), and the area postrema. The axons from these cells project throughout the neuroaxis from the spinal cord to the olfactory bulb and from the cerebral cortex to the hypothalamus. The development of this giant system begins very early in gestation and is influenced by a variety of growth regulatory factors, including the astroglial protein S-100-beta. Evidence will be presented that the scrotonergic system plays a major role in the maturation of the brain by interacting with the 5-HT1A receptors which are most dense during these early developmental periods. The 5-HT1A receptor is located on both neurons and astrocytes, and in the latter cells may serve to stimulate release of S-100-beta. The developmental role of 5-HT appears to become dormant as the brain matures, and during aging and Alzheimer's disease, 5-HT receptors are significantly depressed. However, specific damage to 5-HT fibers in the adult brain by 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine produces a sharp fall in the levels of 5-HT which seems to reactivate the developmental signals in the brain. Not only are the serotonergic fibers encouraged to sprout and expand their territory, but the stimulation of the astrocytic growth factor by a 5-HT1A agonist is reinstated. The ability to recall developmental processes in the adult brain by interrupting the 5-HT fibers may provide important tools for understanding and treating the aged brain.

AB The term 'secondary hypertension' includes a variety of aetiological processes with no obvious common feature apart, perhaps, from the loss of normal blood pressure regulatory factors.  It has been suggested that all forms of secondary hypertension, including renal/renovascular, accelerated phase, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid excess, phaeochromocytoma and toxaemia in pregnancy are associated with the loss of the normal nocturnal fall in blood pressure.  The evidence for this view appears strongest for glucocorticoid-induced hypertension, but for most other forms the available data are conflicting and are mostly based on small numbers of patients without adequate control populations.
   Sleep is a powerful determinant of the nocturnal fall in blood pressure but few studies have addressed the quality of sleep in groups of patients who are often sick and/or hospitalized.  Abnormalities in sympathetic drive (e.g. autonomic neuropathy and phaeochromocytoma) can abolish the nocturnal blood pressure reductions, and activation of the sympathetic nervous system may be a critical factor in determining the normal diurnal changes in blood pressure.  As approximately 20% of patients with 'essential hypertension' have a blunted fall in nocturnal blood pressure it seems unlikely that ambulatory blood pressure could ever be useful in screening for secondary hypertension.

AB The rate of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in Southern New Zealand has been very high with an apparent real increase in incidence from the early 1970s. Recent research is reviewed and the results of specific interventions aimed at preventing SIDS summarized. The intervention consisted of strongly advising new parents that their babies sleep on their back or side and that they avoid over-heating, especially during infections. For the Otago area, child-care practice has been documented and prone sleeping of 1 month old babies has declined from 41.8% in 1986 to 2.4% in 1989-90. There is also evidence that parental control of infants' thermal environment has improved, maternal smoking during pregnancy has slightly decreased and the number of babies breast fed at 1 month of age has increased by 11%. In Southern NZ there has been a decline in post-neonatal SIDS mortality from 6.3 deaths per 1000 live births 1979-84 to 1.3 per 1000 live births in 1990. There are grounds for supposing that the intervention has been causative of this change, a possibility being addressed by on-going studies.

AB Pregnant rats were injected with a single dose of methylazoxymethanol (MAM, 25 mg/kg) on gestational days 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 or 19 which resulted in various degrees of microencephaly.  Offspring were tested on a two-way shuttle box avoidance and residential maze activity at 60 - 90 days of age.  Rats treated on gestational day 19 (GD19) were severely impaired in the acquisition of the two-way shuttle box task whereas the other groups did not show any significant difference from controls.  Spontaneous activity measured for 23 hr in the residential maze was altered as total, time-course and pattern depending on the time of MAM administration:  treatment on GD14 prolonged exploratory behavior, treatment on GD15 and GD16 increased nocturnal activity, treatment on GD16 and GD17 induced changes in locomotion patterns and treatment on GD18 and GD19 decreased total activity.  These findings indicate that treatment with MAM results in selective deficits in the acquisition of a shuttle box avoidance and alterations of locomotion patterns in the offspring which are dependent on the time of administration.

AB Twenty very premature babies, born at 24-29 weeks gestation, have been studied while they were maintained in intensive care with continuous intravenous feeding and constant ambient lighting and temperature. Hourly records of insulated skin temperature and heart rate were made for a continuous period of 6-17 weeks, always starting the recording within 24 h of birth. The development of rhythms within the ultradian, circadian and infradian domains was sought by methods including maximum entropy spectral analysis and autocorrelation. Circadian and ultradian rhythms were present, but not regularly so; rather they appeared and disappeared erratically in successive weeks. As a consequence, the group as a whole did not show an increasing rhythmicity with chronological age. In some cases, babies were later placed in a ward in which the lighting was dimmed at night, and feeding by mouth at regular intervals was instituted. There was some evidence for increases in circadian and ultradian rhythmicity after these changes. These results enable inferences to be drawn as to the origin of fetal rhythms in the third trimester of pregnancy, as well as speculation to be made on the ontogeny of ultradian and circadian rhythms in the neonate.

AB During pregnancy, a number of factors predisposing to hyperthermia, such as sleeping in a water bed, sauna bathing, heatwave, high workplace temperature, and fever, are believed capable of harming the foetus. This study aimed to clarify possible associations of maternal workplace temperature, season of birth, sauna bathing, upper respiratory infection, and fever, with cardiovascular malformations in the offspring. The material was composed of all 573 cardiac malformations registered in Finland in 1982-84, and 1055 randomly chosen healthy controls. The mothers were interviewed at maternity welfare centers about three months after delivery. Fever (greater-than-or-equal-to 38-degrees-C) during early pregnancy was more prevalent among case mothers (10%) than controls (6%) (p < 0.01), largely manifest as increased risks of atrial septal defect and hypoplastic left heart. Upper respiratory infection was also more common among case mothers (26%) than controls (18%) (p < 0.001). By contrast, maternal workplace temperature, sauna bathing, and temperature of the environment (seasonal variation) were not associated with risk of cardiac malformation in the offspring. The use of acetylsalicylic acid-containing medication for reducing fever was equally common (7%) among case and control mothers.

AB No convincing evidence exists that the shift from myometrial contractures to contractions, which determines the synchronized 24-h rhythm in the dynamics of the primate uterus, may be attributed to an endogenous circadian rhythm.  We therefore wished to ascertain whether a 24-h periodic shift would also occur in the myometrial activity of animals kept under constant conditions.  We studied five pregnant rhesus monkeys, kept in continuous darkness from 56-77 days gestational age until delivery at 117-167 days gestational age.  During the last week before delivery we determined the individual phase, level, and amplitude of circadian changes in maternal body temperature and 24-h myometrial activity patterns in the form of contractions.  In all five monkeys, a rhythm with a period of 24-h characterized the temporal incidence of preparturient contraction activity.  A consistent phase lag of 6-7 h from the temperature crest was observed in four out of the five animals.  The circadian phase of all individual rhythms was idiosyncratic among animals.  We conclude that endogenous rhythms in body temperature and preparturient myometrial activity are truly circadian.  In addition, these rhythms are either interdependent or subject to the same maternal timekeeping mechanism, supporting the hypothesis that the exact time of the day at which birth occurs in the rhesus monkey depends on the maternal circadian system.

AB Circadian rhythms in salivary [glucose], [Na+], [K+] and conductivity were measured in 2 age groups of men (men A, 20-45 years and men B, 46-60 years) and 8 different states of fertility in women (normally menstruating, taking oral contraceptives, pregnant, lactational amenorrhea, lactational amenorrhea and taking oral contraceptives, lactating and menstruating, menopausal, and post-menopausal). Unstimulated whole saliva (2-3 ml) was collected every 3 h over a 48 h span. Analysis of Spearman Rank Correlations indicated significant circadian rhythms (significant positive coefficients) for all groups of [Na+] (mean = 0.577 +/- 0.040) and conductivity (mean = 0.410 +/- 0.050). There was no evidence of differences in prominence of rhythm across groups for [Na+] and conductivity. [K+] showed less evidence of rhythms and much greater variability between groups (mean cor-relation coefficient = 0.198 +/- 0.055). Rhythms in [glucose] (mean correlation coefficient = 0.409 +/- 0.051) were evident in all groups except men B (0.016), menopausal women (0.151) and post-menopausal women (0.310). Model analysis of the data showed no discernible rhythmic trend with age for either conductivity, [Ne] or [K+], where any differences were explainable by the group characteristics. The rhythm in [glucose] showed a significant weakening with age over all groups (F-ratio = 7.46**), and was different between men A and men B (F-ratio = 6.95**). It was concluded that circadian rhythms were present in whole unstimulated saliva for conductivity and [Na+] and that these rhythms were independent of reproductive state, whereas circadian rhythms in [K] were dependent on reproductive state. Circadian rhythms for [glucose] were dependent on age. The loss of a rhythm in [glucose] with age indicates that glucose, Na+ and K+ are not linked in their entry into saliva. The influence of entry and reabsorption on the final concentrations of glucose, Na+ and K+ in saliva is discussed.

AB Low amplitude, long-lasting epochs of myometrial activity, contractures, occur throughout the majority of pregnancy in all species studied to date. Contractures are associated with a fall in fetal oxygenation and changes in fetal behavioral state. In the present study we observed that contractures produced by the administration of 70 mU oxytocin iv to the pregnant ewe at 125-139 days gestational age (term 145-150 days) result in a fall in fetal carotid arterial PO2 of approximately 2.5 mm Hg and are followed by a rise in fetal carotid arterial plasma ACTH of 16.3 +/- 9.6 pg.ml-1 (mean +/- SEM). When the contracture-induced fall in fetal arterial PO2 was prevented by administration of oxygen to the ewe, fetal ACTH did not rise after the contracture. In conclusion, these observations demonstrate that the relatively small fall in fetal PO2 that accompanies a contracture can be sensed by the fetus and is an essential part of the stimulus to the increased secretion of fetal ACTH that accompanies a contracture. These findings support the view that myometrial activity is one of the factors that influence fetal ACTH secretion.

ID RATE PATTERNS; HUMAN-FETUS; VARIABILITY; TERM
AB Fetal heart rate variation in early labor was measured by computerized analysis in cyclic episodes of low or high variation in 136 women at 37 to 42 weeks' gestation.  The amplitude (mean +/- SE) in episodes of low variation was 20.6 +/- 0.4 milliseconds; in high variation it was 57.3 +/- 1.1 milliseconds.  The duration (mean +/- SE) of low episodes (24.3 +/- 1.3 minutes) was less than that of high episodes (45.1 +/- 2.7 minutes) but was sometimes > 1 hour.  In episodes of low variation the amplitude was < 5 beats/min long term in 11% and < 2.5 milliseconds (pulse intervals) short term in 8%; these measures would be predictive of intrauterine death if persistent before birth.  We conclude that the use of decreased fetal heart rate variation as a diagnostic sign of acute fetal hypoxemia in labor is incorrect, because changes of this size occur randomly as a consequence of fetal sleep states.  There was no significant correlation between fetal heart rate variation over the last hour of labor and umbilical arterial base deficit on delivery.

AB With the use of a chronic preparation to directly monitor blood pressure and heart rate in pregnant rats, continuous data were obtained over the last half of gestation in normotensive rats.  Over this time span, the animals showed significant decreases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate.  Heart rate exhibited marked and consistent circadian rhythmicity with peaks occurring near the midportion of the dark phase of the 24-hour cycle.  Blood pressure rhythms were less prominent and peaked later.  The trends observed in blood pressure and heart rate over gestation suggest that the pregnant rat is a useful model for studying the cardiovascular effects of pregnancy.

TI DAILY VARIATION OF THE BLOOD-PRESSURE - DIAGNOSTIC AND PROGNOSTIC VALUE
SO ARCHIVES DES MALADIES DU COEUR ET DES VAISSEAUX
LA French
DT Article
ID SHIFT WORKERS; HEART-RATE
AB The blood pressure shows circadian variation in normal subjects with higher diurnal than nocturnal values:  the difference between day and night time blood pressure is about 10-20 mmHg for systolic and for diastolic blood pressure.
   These variations are mainly related to physical and/or psychosensorial stress:  the physician is himself a cause of increased blood pressure (the << white coat >> effect).  The degree of the nocturnal decrease in blood pressure which is maximal 2 and 3 o'clock is related to the quality and depth of sleep.  The nocturnal decrease is followed by an increase in blood pressure when the person wakes up (early morning peak).
   Diagnostic signs:  a physiological inversion of the circadian rhythm may be observed in people who sleep during the daytime and work at night.  There would seem to be less of a nocturnal fall in black persons in the United States.  Some pathological conditions can inverse or at least disturb the ciacadian variation:  apart from hypertension, this has been reported in autonomic nervous system disease, in diabetics with autonomic neuropathy, in some elderly patients, in Cushing's syndrome, after cardiac transplantation, etc...  In hypertensives, the lack of nocturnal decrease of the blood pressure or an inversion in circadian rhythm should be looked for in severe and secondary hypertension such as associated with pheochromocytoma, or in renal dialysis patients.  In toxaemia of pregnancy, this abnormality may herald an eclamptic crisis.
   Prognostic signs:  in normotensives (especially in black persons) and hypertensives, inversion of the circadian rhythm is associated with more severe left ventricular hypertrophy and a higher morbidity.

AB Rest-activity patterns were studied in fetuses exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and in control fetuses at three intervals during pregnancy:  20, 32, and 38 weeks.  At 20 weeks, periods of rest and activity were distinguished on the basis of fetal motility.  Trunk, head, and arm movements were totaled.  Periods of absence of movements for > 3 min were found in 20 of 31 recordings from AED-exposed fetuses compared with 11 of 20 recordings from controls (p > 0.05).  The duration of these periods of inactivity did not differ significantly between the two groups.  At 32 and 38 weeks, information on fetal motility and fetal heart rate (FHR) were combined to recognize rest-activity patterns according to the fetal behavioral state concept.  At 32 weeks, three true fetal behavioral states were found for the study group, while there were none in the control group.  Coincidence 1F through 4F occurred significantly less frequently at 32 weeks than at 38 weeks, regardless of whether fetuses were AED-exposed or not:  59% vs. 82% for the study group and 59% vs. 80% for the controls.  At 38 weeks, true fetal behavioral states appeared in 20 of 34 fetuses exposed to AEDs and in 17 of 35 controls (p > 0.05).  The sequence in which parameters changed within state transitions was found to follow the same preferred pattern in both groups.  For transitions from behavioral state 1F (quiet sleep) into 2F (active sleep) the FHR pattern changed significantly earlier than fetal body or eye movements, while for the reverse transitions the FHR pattern changed significantly later (p < 0.05).  No clearly preferred sequence of the other two state parameters was found.  We concluded that chronic intrauterine exposure to AEDs does not affect fetal rest-activity patterns.

AB Cardio-respiratory physiology in sleep was examined in eight preterm lambs born at 133-135 (134 +/- 1, mean SEM) days of gestation after 3-5 days of pulsatile A CTH/TRH infusion, and contrasted with eight lambs born at term (147 +/- 1 days). Lambs were instrumented with electrodes for recording electrocorticogram, electro-oculogram and nuchal electromyogram to define behavioural states, as well as carotid arterial catheters for determination of arterial pressure, heart rate and arterial blood gases. Compared to full-term lambs, the preterm lambs exhibited extended active sleep times, elevated PaCO2 and faster heart rate in all behavioural states than full-term lambs; with increasing postnatal age, sleep times and heart rate declined. As similar differences are found in preterm human infants, the preterm lamb will be a useful model to study the underlying physiology of these cardio-respiratory alterations.

DE FETAL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; FETAL STATE; SLEEP STATE
ID ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; BEHAVIORAL STATES; SLEEP; SYSTEM
AB Long-term recordings of the electroencephalograms (EEGs) from the non-human fetal primate have been visually scored for state.  Data were obtained from three fetuses using recently developed techniques for chronic instrumentation of the pregnant baboon.  Seven days or more after surgery, nine chart records of 4-5 h in duration were analyzed.  These records were made during an interval in gestation from 143 to 153 days (term = 175 to 185 days).  Criteria for differentiation of EEG state were based on the presence (state 1) or absence (state 2) of trace alternant, which is the predominant characteristic of EEG activity during quiet sleep in human preterm and term infants.  Two patterns of EEG activity were readily distinguished at both standard (30 mm/s) and compressed (30 mm/min) EEG chart speeds.  On a minute-by-minute basis, there was an overall concurrence of 82.9% for EEG state when scored from compressed and standard EEG records.  From the compressed records, state 1 was present on average 38.3% of the time, with a mean epoch duration of 15.1 min, while epochs of state 2 averaged 25.9 min.  We conclude that at least two EEG states are present at this gestation in the fetal baboon.  These two states can be reliably defined visually by scoring methods directly comparable to those used for EEG recognition of sleep states in the human newborn infant.  To validate the conclusion that these fetal state assignments based on patterns of EEG activity correspond to sleep states, it will be necessary to determine if the oscillations of other physiological parameters are coherent with these patterns.

AB A 32 yr-old woman in her last trimester of pregnancy was found to have severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The overnight polysomnogram demonstrated an apnea plus hypopnea index of 159 events per hour. Apneas were associated with severe oxygen desaturation to 40% during rapid eye movement sleep, maternal bradycardia, and second degree heart block. External cardiotocography showed normal fetal heart rate reactivity to fetal movements, even during the apneas and episodes of oxygen desaturation. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure at a level of 15 cm H2O effectively treated the apneas and desaturation and had no effect on the fetal heart rate. The patient was induced electively during the 39th wk of pregnancy and gave birth to a newborn with growth retardation. Early recognition and treatment of OSA in pregnancy might prevent problems with fetal development.

TI SLEEPING POSITION AND RECTAL TEMPERATURE

ID INFANT-DEATH-SYNDROME; MONTH OLD INFANTS
AB The effects of sleeping position upon body temperature were assessed by continuous monitoring of rectal temperature in 137 babies sleeping at home under conditions chosen by their parents. There were three groups of subjects: (1) normal babies aged 12-22 weeks whose temperature rhythms were developed, (2) normal babies aged 6-12 weeks who were developing their night time temperature rhythms, and (3) babies the night after diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus immunisation, whose temperature rhythms were disturbed. Sleeping in the prone position was not associated with higher rectal temperatures at any time of night in young babies, nor did it exaggerate the disturbance of rectal temperature rhythm after immunisation. In older normal babies the prone position did not disturb rectal temperature in the first part of the night, though prone sleepers warmed a little faster prior to waking, especially in warm conditions. Prone sleepers were, however, born earlier in gestation and tended to be of lower birth weight. Normal babies can therefore thermoregulate effectively whatever their sleeping posture, even in warm conditions, though the prone position may make it slightly more difficult to lose heat. It is difficult to see how the prone position, even interacting with warm conditions, could induce lethal hyperthermia in otherwise normal babies. Perhaps the prone position is associated with other risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome.

AB Lung distension with 100% O2 at a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cm H2O may induce continuous fetal breathing movements (FBM) in sheep.  The objectives of this study were 1) to investigate the relative roles of lung distension and oxygenation and 2) to test the hypothesis that FBM can be induced during labor, when normally they are greatly reduced or absent.  We studied 13 chronically instrumented, unanesthetized fetal sheep between 128 and 144 d of gestation (term = 147 +/- 2 d).  Each fetus was instrumented to record sleep states, diaphragm electromyogram, blood pressure, arterial pH, and blood gas tensions.  The fetal lungs were distended via an in situ endotracheal tube with four different concentrations of O2 (0, 21, 50 and 100%) at a continuous positive airway pressure of 10, 20 and 30 cm H2O in a randomized order.  No change in any recorded physiologic variable was observed at 129 +/- 1 or 132 +/- 1 d of gestation.  At 135 +/- 1 and 138 +/- 1 d, in response to a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cm H2O and 100% O2, pH decreased (p = 0.0004 and 0.005, respectively) and arterial O2 tension increased (p = 0.004 and 0.02, respectively).  However, increases in 1) breathing time, 2) breathing time/low-voltage electrocortical activity ratio, 3) duration of arousal, and 4) length of single breathing epochs were observed only at 138 +/- 1 d.  Lung distension with N2 resulted in a decrease in FBM.  Six fetuses were studied during labor.  Significant increase in total breathing time, stimulation of breathing during quiet sleep, and increased duration of arousal were observed with an increase in fetal arterial O2 tension.  The onset of breathing always coincided with the onset of arousal.  We conclude that fetal maturity, an increase in fetal arterial O2 tension, and a change in state from quiet sleep toward arousal are necessary conditions for the induction of FBM.

AB The serum concentration of corticosterone was examined in control and stressed pregnant female mice (Mus domesticus) as well as male and female fetuses due to our interest in the behavioral effects of material stress on offspring in mice. Pregnant females were restrained under flood lights (2 sessions/day, 45 min/session) from Day 13-17 of pregnancy. On Day 17 of pregnancy a significant increase in maternal serum corticosterone was exhibited 1 h after the onset of a stress session, and serum corticosterone did not return to baseline until 16 h later. We also observed a significant increase in serum corticosterone in male fetuses during the first 4 h after maternal stress, while no significant change in serum concentration of corticosterone was observed in female fetuses throughout 24 h after maternal stress. Daily variation in serum concentration of corticosterone was also determined at 4-h intervals in pregnant mice and their fetuses from Day 16-18 of pregnancy. Pregnant females maintained on a 12 L:12 D cycle exhibited peak serum corticosterone concentrations at and just before the onset of the darkness. Daily fluctuations in serum concentrations of corticosterone in male and female fetuses reflected the pattern observed in the mothers. A sex difference in serum corticosterone in fetuses was observed at some, but not all times of the day, with the difference being greatest during the dark phase of the mother's light:dark cycle.

AB Fetal heart rate and fetal movements were recorded in 16 uncomplicated near-term pregnancies.  The recordings were used to evaluate a system for automated fetal heart rate analysis (Sonicaid System 8000).  Fetal rest-activity patterns were considered in the analysis.  The mean duration of C2F periods "active sleep," 33 minutes) was significantly greater than that of C1F periods ("quiet sleep," 19 minutes) (p < 0.001).  The incidence of accelerations and decelerations and the overall fetal heart rate variations were greater during C2F than during C1F (p < 0.001).  In 11 of 16 C1F periods, the system classified the fetal heart rate variation as "questionable" or "abnormal."  Episodes of high variation were identified in only 3 of 16 C1F periods, but they were found in all 18 C2F periods.  Episodes of low variation were identified in 14 of the 16 C1F periods but were not found in any C2F periods.  During C2F periods, the system's criteria of normality were met in all cases but one; they were not met during any of the C1F periods.  Thus the diagnosis of fetal distress should not be based merely on the absence of accelerations, low fetal heart rate variation, or absence of episodes of high variation in recordings with a duration of < 45 minutes.

AB The objective of this study was to determine if a skeletal photoperiod administered at the appropriate time of a 24-h day could stimulate prolactin and somatotropin release in dairy cattle.  Cows in mo 8 of gestation were exposed to either 12 to 13 h of continuous light or to three skeletal photoperiods consisting of a total of 8 h of light.  Cows in the skeletal photoperiod light regimens received 6 h of light from 0500 to 1100 h and a 2-h light pulse at either 1500 to 1700 h, 1800 to 2000 h, or 2100 to 2300 h.  Cows exposed to the light regimen pulse at 1800 to 2000 h exhibited a circadian rhythm of prolactin and somatotropin release.  The mean prolactin and somatotropin concentrations were also higher in this treatment.  It is concluded that a circadian rhythm with a photosensitive phase is present for prolactin and somatotropin release in the lactating dairy cow.  The photosensitive phase for both hormones occurs between 13 and 15 h after subjective dawn.  The expression of the circadian rhythm of these hormones depends on the photoperiod to which cows are exposed.

AB The association and possible interactions of fetal behavioural state, fetal heart rate and vascular resistance was studied in 23 healthy pregnant women between 36 and 40 weeks' gestation.  Doppler flow velocity waveforms were obtained from fetal cerebral (anterior cerebral, internal carotid and basilar), descending aorta and umbilical arteries during fetal behavioural state 1F and repeated during 2F.  The Resistance Index (RI) was used as a measure of vascular resistance.  Decreased vascular resistance was observed in all vessels except the umbilical artery during fetal behavioural state 2F compared to 1F (P < 0.001).  A significant interaction was observed between fetal heart rate and fetal behavioural state on the RI of the vessels studied, with a greater negative slope for RI plotted against fetal heart rate in fetal behavioural state 2F (-0.00139) compared to 1F (0.00005) (P < 0.001).  We conclude that the transition from fetal behavioural state 1F to 2F is associated with a significant reduction in cerebral and systemic vascular resistance, with no apparent change in placental resistance.  Furthermore, fetal behavioural state and fetal heart rate interact, demonstrating a stronger association of fetal heart rate and RI in fetal behavioural state 2F in keeping with an increase in baroreflex sensitivity at this time.

AB The influence of preeclampsia on the circulating concentrations of the 28-amino-acid carboxy terminus (C-terminus) (i.e., atrial natriuretic factor) and the amino terminus (N-terminus) of the 126-amino-acid atrial natriuretic factor prohormone (pro ANF) was studied in the third trimester with the use of three specific radioimmunoassays that recognize:  (1) atrial natriuretic factor (i.e., amino acids 99 to 126), (2) the whole 98-amino-acid N-terminus, and (3) amino acids 31 to 67 from the midportion of the N-terminus of the prohormone.  The C-terminus was significantly increased (p < 0.001) in the third trimester in women with preeclampsia, the mean +/- SEM of 15 subjects was 150 +/- 7 pg/ml versus 89 +/- 7 pg/ml in the third trimester in 12 women during normal pregnancies and 65 +/- 2 pg/ml in 19 healthy nonpregnant women.  The whole 98-amino-acid N-terminus, likewise, was significantly increased (p < 0.001) in women with preeclampsia to 4706 +/- 629 pg/ml versus 2160 +/- 79 pg/ml in women in the third trimester of normal pregnancies and versus the circulating concentration of 1847 +/- 127 pg/ml in healthy nonpregnant women.  ProANF 31 to 67 mean circulating concentration  in preclampsia was 4638 +/- 725 pg/ml, which was also significantly (p < 0.001) increased compared with its mean circulating concentration in the third trimester of normal pregnancy of 1758 +/- 83 pg/ml or that in healthy nonpregnant women (1400 +/- 105 pg/ml).  The circulating concentrations of both the N-terminus and C-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor prohormone decreased within 24 hours after delivery in contrast to a normal pregnancy in which they both increase post partum.  These results indicate a marked difference in the metabolism of both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor prohormone in women with preeclampsia versus that in women with normal pregnancies or that in healthy nonpregnant women.

AB The aim of this study was to characterize the pre-natal activity of the respiratory muscles in a non-ruminant, the pig.  Tracheal pressure was recorded from 11 unanaesthetized fetal pigs in utero during late gestation in 9 sows.  Two types of inspiratory effort occurred episodically in each fetus during each recording period.  Episodes of breathing movements lasted 8.6 +/- 1.1 min and their overall incidence was 41.1 +/- 3.4% of recording time.  The mean amplitude of the respiratory efforts was 7.6 +/- 1.1 mmHg and the mean inspiratory time was 0.8 +/- 0.1 s.  Episodes of non-respiratory inspiratory efforts, considered to be fetal hiccups, lasted 5.6 +/- 0.8 min.  Individual hiccups had a duration of 150-200 msec, a mean amplitude of 41.4 +/- 2.4 mmHg and a mean frequency, during episodes, of 21.9 +/- 2.0 min-1.  In contrast to fetal breathing movements, hiccups appeared to be stereotyped events.  It is concluded that, in common with other ruminant and non-ruminant species, two types of inspiratory effort occur in the fetal pig.  Fetal hiccups, which have been observed in non-ruminant species, may be analogous to deep inspiratory efforts in the sheep fetus.  The stimulus for and function of, fetal hiccuping remain to be determined.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of supplemental lysine and tryptophan on pregnancy course and outcome in rats. From day 0 until day 20 of pregnancy, rats received one of the following diets ad libitum: lysine at 50% (L-50), 100% (L-100) or 500% (L-500) excess over controls (C); or tryptophan at 500% (T-500), 1,000% (T-1000) or 2,500% (T-2,500) excess. One group of rats received a control diet ad libitum and each treatment group had a matched pair-fed group receiving a control diet. No congenital malformations were observed in any of the fetuses. Groups L-50, L-100, T-500 and T-1,000 showed no significant differences in maternal weight gain or fetal condition compared to the controls. L-500 had a comparatively lower maternal weight gain and fetuses of significantly smaller weight and length than any other group, although their food consumption was above "C" level. T-2,500 had a significantly lower maternal weight gain than all groups, although its pair-fed control consumed less diet and did not have a significantly decreased maternal weight gain. T-2,500 had the lowest total fetal weight of any group. In summary, variable levels of lysine or tryptophan supplementation did not cause recognizable fetal malformations. However, diets highly supplemented with lysine or tryptophan may affect pregnancy through a decrease in maternal weight gain and fetal size.

AB Plasma corticosteroid concentrations are altered in pregnancy, during the reproductive cycle and by ovariectomy in many species.  This study was designed to examine basal ACTH and cortisol in ewes of four different reproductive statuses:  ovariectomized, nonpregnant cycling, nonpregnant noncycling, and pregnant.  Blood samples were drawn every 4 hr for 48 hr from ewes during quiet, undisturbed conditions and analyzed for plasma ACTH, cortisol and progesterone concentrations.  There were no significant changes in ACTH, cortisol or progesterone over time.  Mean progesterone concentrations were significantly greater in the pregnant ewes than in all other ewes, and were greater in cycling ewes than noncycling or ovariectomized ewes.  Mean ACTH was significantly greater in pregnant ewes than noncycling ewes, and mean cortisol was significantly greater in cycling ewes than in nonpregnant cycling or noncycling ewes.  Ovariectomized ewes also had significantly greater mean cortisol concentrations than cycling ewes.  The results demonstrate that there is an increase in basal ACTH and cortisol in ovine pregnancy.

AB Transvaginal ultrasonography with colour flow mapping has been used to study changes in intra-follicular morphology and blood flow during a peri-ovulatory period in one volunteer.  Aspects of uterine morphology and blood flow were also recorded.  The intervals from a defined luteinizing hormone (LH) rise and peak to the mean time of follicular rupture were 37.5 and 17.5 h, respectively.  Blood flow velocity waveforms were observed clearly at the time of the LH rise and blood vessels were visible when the hormone level reached a peak.  Concurrently, the wall of the follicle became less clear, crenated, thicker and more echogenic.  A structure resembling the detached cumulus and oocyte was seen before the follicle had ruptured.  Peak systolic blood velocity was highest immediately after ovulation had occurred.  Blood flow impedance in the uterine arteries suggested the presence of a circadian rhythm, but no pronounced daily changes were observed over the study period.  In contrast, flow velocity waveforms were clearly visible in the endometrium around the time of ovulation.  These preliminary data suggest that intra-follicular vascularization or angiogenesis may be critical processes that might be used to predict ovulation and could possibly be modified to help achieve or avoid a pregnancy.

AB beta-Blockers are used in pregnancy-associated hypertension and in postnatal cardiac arrhythmias, and the neonate may get them in breast milk. We therefore studied the effects of beta-adrenergic medication on interrelations between heart rate (HR), respiration, and arterial blood pressure (aBP) in newborn lambs. The influence of sleep state on these cardiorespiratory interrelations was also examined. HR, aBP, and respiration (based on transthoracic electrical impedance) were recorded and the sleep state was visually documented in five healthy chronically instrumented newborn lambs before the age of 30 d. Propranolol was given (1 mg/kg). Two-min stationary segments of the three signals were analyzed using a multivariate autoregressive model, which yields oscillations of the signals and intersignal relationships as source contributions. The variabilities of aBP and HR were greatest at the low frequencies ( < 0.25 Hz) and so were their intersignal relationships (including baroreflex). The respiratory variability was greatest at the frequencies corresponding to the respiratory rate. During quiet sleep, the variabilities in HR, aBP, and respiration were lowest. The impact of respiratory oscillations on other signals increased but the impact of aBP variability decreased during quiet sleep. beta-Blockade and sleep state affected separately the cardiovascular and respiratory variables and their interrelations. beta-Blockade reduced HR and increased pulse pressure. The overall heart rate variability and the respiratory low-frequency contribution to heart rate variability decreased due to the beta-blockade. We postulate that the beta-adrenergic system is an important regulator of HR and HR variability in neonatal lambs and also of the low-frequency components of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia. However, inasmuch as the interrelations between HR and aBP were not altered by the beta-blockade, even high doses of propranolol do not seem hazardous for the cardiovascular system in neonatal lambs.

AB Pregnant dams were subjected to REM sleep deprivation during different stages of pregnancy.  Pups were reared by their biological mothers and tested as adults for susceptibility to PTZ-induced convulsions, and ambulation and defecation in an open-field arena.  Adrenal weights were taken at this time.  Those animals whose mothers had been stressed during the first trimester showed a reduction in ambulatory behavior measured in the open field, and a reduction in adrenal weight after open-field exposure.  Subjects exposed to prenatal stress (PNS) during the 2nd trimester showed an increased susceptibility to PTZ-induced clonic convulsions, and a reduction in adrenal weight after PTZ administration and open-field exposure.  Finally, subjects exposed to PNS during the third trimester showed a reduction in susceptibility to PTZ compared with 2nd week PNS pups.  The results showed different patterns of prenatal stress-induced behavioral and physiological changes, depending on the developmental stage in which the stress was applied.

   TASMANIA
AB New Zealand's high mortality rate from the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) prompted the development of the New Zealand cot death study. This report of the preliminary analysis of the first year of the data gives the major identified risk factors. One hundred and sixty-two infants who died from SIDS were compared with 589 control infants, who were a representative sample of all hospital births in the study region. Obstetric records were examined and parental interviews were completed in 96% and 89% of subjects respectively. Data were available for all the variables in this study in 95% of those interviewed, thus 128 cases and 503 controls make up the subjects of this report.
   As expected we confirmed many risk factors for SIDS including: lower socioeconomic status, unmarried mother, young mother, younger school leaving age of mother, younger age of mother at first pregnancy, late attendance at antenatal clinic, nonattendant at antenatal classes, Maori, greater number of previous pregnancies, lower birth weight, shorter gestation, male infant, admission to neonatal intensive care unit. In addition, however, we identified three risk factors which are potentially amenable to modification. These were the prone sleeping position of baby (odds ratio = 3.53, 95% confidence interval 2.26, 5.54), maternal smoking (1-9 cigarettes/day OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 0.98, 3.54; 10-19/day OR = 2.64, 95% CI = 1.47, 4.74; 20 +/day OR = 5.06, 95% CI = 2.86, 8.95) and breast feeding (OR = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.84, 4.67). After controlling for all the above variables, the relative risks associated with prone sleeping position (OR = 5.74), not breast feeding (OR = 2.45) and maternal smoking (OR = 1.83) were still statistically significant. These variables appear independent of each other in their association with SIDS. Population attributable risk was calculated for these three variables. In total these three risk factors may account for 79% of deaths from SIDS.
   If all parents stop putting their infants down to sleep in the prone position, do not smoke and breast feed their infants the SIDS mortality rate may fall from 4.0/1000 live births to less than 1/1000.

AB We studied the association between the prenatal diets of 212 mothers assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and the blood pressure of their infants.  Prenatal potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes were measured and adjusted for total caloric intake.  Infant blood pressure was measured at 2-3 days and at 1, 6, and 12 months of age by using an ultrasonic-auscultatory device and was adjusted for cuff size, observer, and sleep/activity status, age in days in neonates, and weight at 6 and 12 months.  Maternal prenatal potassium intake was inversely related to diastolic pressure at 6 months (r =-0.28, p < 0.01) and at 12 months (r =-0.30, p < 0.05).  After adjustment for neonatal breast versus formula feeding, maternal prenatal calcium intake was inversely related to systolic blood pressure at 1 month (r = -0.21, p < 0.01), and to diastolic blood pressure at 6 months (r = -0.27, p < 0.01) and 12 months (r = -0.24, p < 0.05).  Maternal prenatal magnesium intake was inversely related to 6-month systolic blood pressure (r =-0.20, p < 0.05).  In multivariable models with all three cations, maternal prenatal potassium intake was independently and inversely related to diastolic blood pressure at 6 and 12 months.  Maternal prenatal calcium intake was independently related to 1-month systolic and 6-month diastolic blood pressure.  Age-specific infant blood pressure differences between the upper and lower quartiles of maternal prenatal cation intakes ranged from 3 to 7 mm Hg.  These results are consistent with adult studies and suggest that maternal prenatal intakes of potassium, calcium, and perhaps magnesium, influence infant blood pressure throughout the first year of life.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF CIRCADIAN SLEEP-WAKEFULNESS RHYTHMICITY OF 3 INFANTS

DE HUMAN CIRCADIAN RHYTHM; DEVELOPMENT; EARLY INFANCY; SLEEP-WAKEFULNESS
AB The spontaneous sleep-wakefulness behavior of three infants (one male and two females) from the same parents, normal with respect to pregnancy and delivery, was observed continuously from 2-14 days after birth up to 4 months of life.  The infants were allowed to feed and sleep according to their own schedule.  One of them supplied another sample of clear freerunning circadian rhythmicity during the first postnatal month.  The least square cosine fitting method and the maximal entropy spectral analysis with high spectral resolution revealed the circadian rhythmicity to exist as early as the first week of life.  This fact may suggest that the human circadian clock regulating the daily sleep-wakefulness rhythm is already functional at birth.  It was also found that sleep duration depended on the timing of sleep:  the first nighttime sleep being the longest, while the sleep during the early morning and the late afternoon was the shortest.  These results are discussed with respect to the development of circadian rhythmicity.

AB Although unprotected premature sexual activity is associated with well-defined biologic risks of sexually transmitted disease and pregnancy, the concomitant psychosocial risks are less well documented. The strength of association (odds ratio) of coital status with other risk behaviors and feelings was examined in 1504 junior high school students.  Among the 12 through 16-year-old students, 63% of the boys and 36% of the girls were nonvirginal (had had intercourse at least once).  The proportion of sexually experienced boy and girls increased with age.  Nonvirginal boys and girls were significantly (P < .001) more likely than their virginal cohorts to engage in other activities considered risky.  The odds ratios for nonvirginal youth ranged from 3.5 for girls having used drugs other than alcohol or marijuana, to 10.4 for girls having used marijuana.  Nonvirginal boys and girls were also at significantly greater risk for engaging in minor delinquent acts and having school problems.  Nonvirginal girls (but not boys) were 6.3 times more likely to report having attempted suicide.  The strength of associations with feelings was weaker.  Nonvirginal girls were at slightly greater risk for reporting feeling lonely, feeling upset, and having difficulty sleeping.  A significant proportion of the students reported sexual experience and ever use of alcohol or marijuana (45% of boys, 27% of girls).  There were strong age effects so that by age 15 years, 63% of the boys and 50% of the girls reported experience with both activities.  The data suggest that early sexual experience among adolescents is associated with other potentially health-endangering behaviors and that the syndrome of problem behaviors is important in this age group.

AB To assess how REM/NREM periods can be linked to the determination of the REM/NREM sleep and/or awake state, we have investigated the relationship between the REM/NREM periods and penile tumescence in the human fetus. This study was made on 11 male fetuses from 36 to 41 weeks of gestation. Eye movement and penile tumescence were simultaneously examined with an observation window of 60 min, using two separate real-time ultrasound systems. The mean percentage of the total duration of penile tumescence during the REM period and that during the NREM period was 77.7 and 15.8%, respectively. In all cases, the total duration of penile tumescence during the REM period against REM duration was greater than the duration of tumescence during the NREM period against NREM duration with statistical significance. This indicates that the fetal penile tumescence is strongly associated with REM period and the REM period containing penile tumescence in the human fetus can be considered equivalent to REM sleep in utero. In addition, the finding that there exists a part of the REM period lacking penile tumescence suggests the possible origin of the awake state, brought about by advances in fetal development at this stage of gestation.

ID AGE
AB The inspiratory times of fetal breathing movements were measured in REM and NREM periods, respectively, and their changes with advancing gestational age were investigated. Ten women without complications in their 20th to 40th week of pregnancy were examined. Fetal breathing movements and REM were observed simultaneously using ultrasonography. REM and NREM periods were selected for analyzing breathing movements separate from the whole examination period. The inspiratory times of fetal breathing movements were measured with the hand-held pressure transducer. The changes in inspiratory time with fetal age showed the same pattern both in REM and NREM periods. There were no significant changes in inspiratory time before 28 weeks gestational age. After that, the inspiratory time lengthened, showing the maximum at 32-35 weeks and then shortened at 36-40 weeks gestational age. There were no differences of the inspiratory time between REM and NREM periods before 32 weeks. After 32 weeks, the inspiratory time in the NREM period was longer than in the REM period. These changes in fetal breathing movements are thought to be caused by the morphological maturation of the fetal lung and the functional development of respiratory and sleep center of the fetal central nervous system.

AB The purpose of the study was to determine whether there were circadian variations in serum osteocalcin in normal horses and to determine whether it was important to regulate the time of blood sampling in clinical investigations.  Osteocalcin or bone Gla-protein (BGP), alkaline phosphatase, total calcium, phosphate and total protein were studied over a 24 h period.  Blood samples were taken every 60 min from nine adult Standardbred horses.  There was a correlation between serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (r = 0.3, p < 0.01), phosphate (r = 0.42, p < 0.01) and serum osteocalcin levels.  There was a very marked individual effect on serum levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.01).  This effect was present for phosphate levels but not significant for total calcium.  The individual effect was lower and time effect was higher for serum osteocalcin if the subjects were divided into two age groups, one of horses of five years or less (n = 4) and a second group older than five years (n = 5).  In both groups a circadian rhythmicity was observed.  Serum osteocalcin showed a biphasic pattern.  Levels were constant during daytime (light period) and underwent significant variations during the night (dark period), going through a nadir at 2000 h and through a maximum peak at 0500 h.  It was concluded that in normal horses the blood osteocalcin level follows a circadian variation.  Also daytime (light period) seems to be the more appropriate period for blood sampling.

AB 1.  The diurnal changes in the level of total protein, cortisol, T3 and T4 were studied in four barren and four pregnant standard-bred mares, kept and examined under the same conditions.
   2.  Blood samples were taken every 4 hr, for one day each month, throughout one year.
   3.  In barren mares, a diurnal rhythm in cortisol level (acrophase at 0530 hr in summer and at 0830 hr in winter) and in T3 level (acrophase at 1330 hr in summer and at 1800 hr in winter) was found.
   4.  In pregnant mares, a diurnal rhythm in cortisol level only till 5th month of pregnancy was observed.
   5.  A diurnal rhythm in T3 level was found throughout the pregnancy, with acrophase always at 1400 hr.
   6.  No diurnal rhythm in the total protein content and in the T4 level was observed.
   7.  In both groups of mares the seasonal cyclicity in T3 and T4 levels were found.  A seasonal cyclicity in cortisol level was found only in pregnant mares.
   8.  Pregnancy abolished seasonal cyclicity in total protein and showed it in cortisol level.
   9.  Pregnancy in mares modifies diurnal rhythms as well as seasonal  cycles in secretion and metabolism of the hormones studied.

AB We studied maternal and fetal blood pressure, heart rate, arterial blood gases and fetal behavioral state alterations in response to maternally administered cocaine hydrochloride in 11 pregnant sheep. Cocaine administration to the ewe caused a dose-dependent increase in maternal blood pressure and heart rate and in fetal blood pressure, and a decrease in fetal arterial oxygen tension. In the ewe, blood pressure changes corresponded linearly to dose administered (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). Blood pressure changes were correlated to peak plasma cocaine concentration in the ewe (r = 0.52, p < 0.01) and in the fetus (r = 0.43, p = 0.05). In addition, in 7 of 8 fetuses which had entered rapid eye movement (REM) sleep within 5 min of maternal cocaine administration, REM sleep was abruptly terminated either by the cocaine, fetal hypoxia or some other nonspecific event caused by the maternal cocaine administration. Maternal cocaine administration causes maternal and fetal hemodynamic alterations that have potential adverse effects in pregnancy.

AB Pregnant rats were treated with ethanol intragastrically (5.8 g/kg in two divided doses) spaced 4 hr apart on gestation days (GD) 7 and 8. Ganglioside GM1 was injected (10 mg/kg, IM) 24 hr and 1 hr prior to ethanol on GD7 and 1 hr prior on GD8. The controls received saline only. Maternal blood alcohol reached peak levels of 4.3 mg/ml within 2 hr in both groups. There were no significant differences between the groups gain body weight, gestation time, or the lifter size. There were also no significant differences in birth weight and the brain weight of the pups. At the age of 45 days, equal number of male offspring from each group were tested for hypnotic effect (sleep time) of ethanol challenge dose (3.5 g/kg). Animals that received ethanol alone in utero had a shorter sleep time compared to no ethanol controls (81 +/- 19 and 130 +/- 28 min respectively, P < .0l). Ganglioside GM1 treated animals had sleep time similar to that of controls (131 +/- 21 min). There were no significant differences in wakeup blood alcohol between the groups. These results indicate that pretreatment with GM1 ganglioside of maternal rats antagonized decrease in sleep time in offspring induced by prenatal ethanol exposure.

AB Serum prolactin (HPR) levels are influenced by waking and sleep states, as reflected by surges in serum concentrations during daytime naps and nocturnal sleep. Other physiological causes of hyperprolactinemia include sexual activity, pregnancy, and lactation. Drugs may stimulate or inhibit HPR secretion. Pathological causes for HPR secretion include destructive lesions of the hypothalamus, prolactin-secreting neoplasms of the pituitary gland, lesions of the spinal cord, and occasionally Parkinson's disease. The most predictable postictal changes are increased serum cortisol levels and hyperprolactinemia. Serum HPR rises after virtually all generalized tonic-clonic seizures, most complex partial seizures, and some simple partial seizures. Absence and myoclonic seizures do not affect serum HPR levels. Repeated epileptic seizures and electroconvulsive therapy treatments produce successively less marked rises in serum HPR. The postictal elevation of serum cortisol has a longer latency than for HPR and follows an earlier rise in serum ACTH. Other postictal hormonal changes are much more variable. Because of the normal diurnal variation in serum cortisol levels and the relative delay in the postictal elevation of serum cortisol, HPR is more useful as a diagnostic measure of epileptic seizures. This application of HPR requires an understanding of other factors that influence serum HPR and the use of baseline serum HPR levels for comparison. HPR data must be correlated with behavioral and electroencephalographic events.

AB Thyroid function was investigated during and after pregnancy in 12 healthy euthyroid women. During pregnancy, serum total T4 (TT4) levels were significantly elevated and nearly stable, while thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels progressively increased till the 7th month. A slight elevation, though not significant, of free T4 (fT4) was recorded in early pregnancy. In the following months, fT4, free T3 (fT3) and the T4/TBG ratio progressively diminished, reaching a plateau at the 7th month. Serum TSH levels, measured by an ultrasensitive immunofluorometric assay, were comparable to postpartum values during the first trimester and showed a moderate upward trend with the progression of pregnancy. The evaluation of 24-hour TSH profiles was performed in 5 women during the first trimester of pregnancy. In all women, the circadian rhythm of TSH was present with a normal nocturnal surge, though anticipated in 1 case. In summary (1) during the first trimester of pregnancy, the increased thyroid activity does not seem to be only sustained by pituitary TSH which remains unmodified; the negative correlation between TSH and hCG levels might suggest that hCG also stimulates the gland to increase thyroid hormone output, and the presence of a normal TSH circadian rhythm indicates that the central mechanism of neuroregulation of the pituitary-thyroid axis is preserved in early pregnancy, and (2) in late pregnancy, a marked decrease in free thyroid hormone fractions is accompanied by serum TSH levels still in the normal range, indicating a modification of thyroid homeostasis which might recognize various etiological factors.

AB We have investigated the effect of maternal pinealectomy between 104 and 120 days gestation on the daily rhythm in plasma prolactin concentrations in the ewe, foetus and newborn lamb. There was a 24 h prolactin rhythm present in both the intact (n = 4) and pinealectomized (n = 4) ewes. Plasma prolactin concentrations were highest at 2100 h (i.e. 2 h after lights off) and a daily prolactin rhythm was present until at least 24 h before delivery. The mean 24 h foetal plasma concentration of prolactin was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the pinealectomized (35.3 +/- 1.9-mu-g/l) than in the intact group (6.9 +/- 0 6-mu-g/l) There was a significant 24 h rhythm in foetal prolactin concentrations and the timing of the daily peak (2100 h) was the same in the foetuses of intact and pinealectomized ewes. During the first 10 weeks after birth there was a significant effect of time of day on prolactin concentrations but the 24 h prolactin profile was significantly different in the lambs delivered to pinealectomized ewes than in the lambs delivered to intact ewes. In the lambs delivered after maternal pinealectomy, plasma prolactin concentrations were higher between 1900 and 2300 h than between 0700 and 1100 h, whereas in lambs delivered to intact ewes, prolactin concentrations were higher at 0100 h than between 1500 and 1700 h. We conclude that the ontogenesis of the daily rhythm in foetal and newborn lamb plasma prolactin concentrations is not dependent on a daily melatonin signal from the ewe.

AB A typical diurnal variation in blood pressure is observed in patients with essential hypertension.  Attenuation or lack of circadian periodicity might be expected in patients with secondary hypertension.
   Therefore, non invasive ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring was performed in 172 patients with secondary hypertension and in 201 patients with essential hypertension.
   The following patients with secondary hypertension were investigated:  renoparenchymatous nephropathy (n = 29), diabetic nephropathy (n = 24), morbus Conn (n = 6), renal artery stenosis (n = 32), pheochromocytoma (n = 5), hemodialysis patients (n = 30), and patients after kidney transplantation (n = 44).
   In addition, 36 pregnant women (17 normotensives, 19 hypertensives) were studied.  98.5 % of patients with essential hypertension showed a nightly decline in blood pressure of at least 15 mmHg (systolic + diastolic), whereas 70 % of patients with secondary hypertension showed either an attenuated circadian rhythm or no circadian rhythm.  Patients with pheochromocytoma who had a nighttime increase in blood pressure demonstrated the greatest difference in the essential hypertension collective, followed by patients with diabetic nephropathy and patients after kidney transplantation.
   After successful treatment of the condition leading to hypertension, circadian periodicity returned in some patients.
   In summary, these results suggest that the absence of a nighttime decline in blood pressure during 24-h-ambulatory monitoring is an indication of secondary hypertension, which should be further investigated.  As a practical consequence, antihypertensive drugs should also be applied in an evening dose in secondary hypertensives.  Noninvasive ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring is recommended for treatment control, especially in patients who need an efficient blood-pressure control.

AB In normal pregnancy the circadian blood pressure rhythm is similar to that in the non-pregnant state, with the highest blood pressure values in the morning and the lowest at midnight.  This rhythm is lost in patients with pre-eclampsia.  Women with severe pre-eclampsia show a reversed circadian rhythm, with a nocturnal increase in blood pressure during the sleeping phase.  Although the reasons for this nocturnal hypertension in severe pre-eclampsia are poorly understood, the results suggest that pre-eclamptic women are endangered by hypertensive emergencies, mostly at night.  Therefore blood pressure measurement should be extended to the night, and antihypertensive treatment must be adapted to the demands of a reversed circadian rhythm in relevant subgroups of patients.

AB Abnormalities of respiratory regulation, such as apnea and abnormal hypoxic arousal during sleep, are mechanistic in the pathophysiology of SIDS.  In utero cocaine exposure is associated with poor head growth, abnormal neurodevelopment, and an increased incidence of sudden, unexplained death, suggesting that in utero cocaine exposure disrupts the central regulation of breathing.  It is likely that this disruption is due to altered CNS maturation.  Indeed, cocaine alters norepinephrine metabolism within the locus coeruleus, important in arousal from sleep, suggesting that the increased incidence of SIDS in cocaine exposed infants may be secondary to sleep-related deficits in arousal.  Since components of fetal behavioural state organization reflect the successful integration of the Central Nervous System, have a specific developmental timetable, and can be studied by fetal ultrasound techniques, we developed a strategy for assessing the state organization of the fetus by ultrasound techniques.  We hypothesize that fetal evaluation of state will be a marker of abnormal CNS maturation and a predictor of risk, i.e. abnormal neurodevelopent and/or state related arousal deficits predisposing the cocaine exposed neonate to SIDS.  We propose that the study of in utero cocaine exposed fetuses will provide a human model for examining the pathophysiology of SIDS.

AB Respiratory control abnormalities are mechanistic in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). In particular, arousal from sleep is an important component of respiratory regulation. Cocaine alters central neurotransmitter metabolism, particularly the monoamines. The locus coeruleus, the major Norepinephrine (NE) neuronal system, is involved in arousal from sleep related apnea and has extensive forebrain and brainstem projections. Thus, it is plausible that in utero cocaine exposure disrupts the normal maturation of transmitters and/or brain structures essential to sleep related respiratory regulation. Infants exposed to cocaine in utero may have increased incidence of SIDS. We propose that cocaine use in pregnancy alters the normal maturation of centers and/or neurotransmitters involved in respiratory regulation thereby altering postnatal respiratory control. We hypothesize that the increased incidence of SIDS in cocaine exposed infants may be secondary to deficits in arousal. The study of prenatal brain development and of postnatal respiratory control in rabbit pups exposed to cocaine in utero will provide a useful model for the study of mechanisms operative in SIDS.

AB Repeated application of GnRH agonists causes a reversible suppression of ovarial function.  Suppression on estrogen release is the fundamental idea of this hormonal therapy of endometriosis.
   We treated twelve patients with histologically prooved endometriosis with leuprolideacetate depot in a dosis of 3.75 mg s.c. every 4 weeks over a period of 6 months.  In the first week of therapy the estrogen level decreased to a post-menopausal niveau along with amenorrhoea during the entire period of therapy.  Complaints previous to therapy such as dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain and dyspareunia were releaved or completely disappeared after therapy.  The clinical finding on palpation also diminished or disappeared.  In addition to this finding pelviscopy showed a shift from severe endometriosis stage III and stage IV to stage I and stage II of the AFS classification 1985.
   Regular menstruation appeared in 5 to 9 weeks after the last application to all patients.  Out of six cases of infertility, four patients became pregnant.  Except for one case, typical menopausal symptoms appeared, such as flush, increased perspiration and sleeping disorders.  During and after therapy we could not prove any changes in the lipid metabolism under estrogen therapy.  Mineralization of the bone decreased under therapy by about 3%.  Simultaneously, serum osteocalcine increased.  Demineralization occurred with one exception within the normal range for the corresponding age.
   With identic efficiency but less side effects, we see therapy with GnRH agonists as an alternative to current hormonal therapy of endometriosis.

AB The effects on breathing movements and sleep state of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) and its antagonist, proglumide, have been studied in unanaesthetised fetal lambs of 124-142 days gestation.  CCK-8 when given into a lateral cerebral ventricle as bolus injections of 10-500 ng caused dose-related periods of apnea ranging from 63-214 min.  When given as a 100 ng bolus followed by a 50 ng/h infusion for 2 h there was a prolonged period of apnea lasting 331 +/- 56 min.  There was no effect of CCK-8 when given in higher doses (1-50-mu-g).  The antagonist proglumide reversed the apnea induced by CCK-8 infusion, but had no effect when given alone, nor did it affect the normal fetal depressive response to hypoxia.  Neither CCK-8 nor proglumide had any effect on electrocortical activity.
   We conclude that CCK has no role in the inhibitory mechanisms causing the apnea associated with high voltage electrocortical activity or hypoxia in the fetus.  Furthermore CCK does not appear to be involved in the regulation of sleep state in the fetal lamb.

AB The circadian rhythm of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was investigated in pregnant women with normal and pre-eclamptic gestation.  The chronobiological approach was able to document the occurrence of a circadian rhythm for serum ACE activity in normal pregnancy.  Such a rhythm is characterized by a decreased mesor and amplitude and a shifted crest.  The circadian rhythm for serum ACE activity was not detectable in pre-eclamptic pregnancy.  Such an abrogation is accompanied by a negligible decrease of mesor suggesting the occurrence of a relative hyperACEemia.  This disorder could play a role in pregnancy-induced hypertension.
