N2  - The development of fetal behaviour is reviewed. Fetal cutaneous and muscle sensory receptors are developed by the time movements are first seen. Human infants certainly respond to painful stimuli at 28 weeks. There is no clear evidence that prenatal 'stress', e.g., maternal exposure to random noise and bright lights, impairs fetal development in the rat, on the contrary. Fetal diurnal rhythms appear in man and sheep before the development of sleep states; they are dependent on maternal corticosteroids, but the fetal mechanism is uncertain. With the development of sleep states (in late gestation in man and sheep, postnatally in the rat), the complex central control of behaviour is gradually established, but wakefulness is still of low incidence. The location of the sleep cycle generator is uncertain; the results of experimental lesions of the brainstem in fetal lambs appear incompatible with studies in adult rats and cats.

N2  - The aims of our study were: 1) to answer the question 'Do sleep states exist in normal premature infants'; 2) to analyze the development of sleep cycle and sleep state characteristics in premature and full-term newborns. Polygraph recordings were done on 38 normal, appropriate for gestational age newborns, born at 30 to 41 weeks (w) of gestation. All infants fell asleep in active sleep (AS). Postwaking AS was significantly shorter than the next AS. Mean sleep cycle duration increased from approximately 46 min at 31-34 w of conceptional age (CA) to 70 min. at 35-36 w CA. In all infants we observed stable, >5 min AS and quiet sleep (QS) periods, as defined by EEG and REM criteria. Indeterminate sleep was about 30% of the total sleep cycle at 31-34 w; it decreased to 12% at 35-36 w. Both duration and percentage of AS and QS significantly increased at 35-36 w and remained stable up to 39-41 w CA. Values of QS were significantly reduced when defined by additional criteria (respiratory rate, tonic chin EMG or motility). Concordance of QS criteria was not significantly better in older versus younger groups of infants. At all ages, AS values were insensitive to changes in the criteria chosen to define them. The contrast, starting from 31-34 w CA, between AS and QS as defined by EEG and REM criteria could account for state differences in the control of many physiological variables in prematures.

N2  - A case of sleep apnoea syndrome in a pregnant patient is reported here. For obstetric reasons, and because of the possibility that a metabolic and respiratory acidosis associated with the apnoea syndrome might have developed, we decided to do a caesarian section. Orotracheal intubation was particularly difficult because of the patient's abnormal mandibular, palatal and retropharyngeal shape, which was probably the underlying cause of the apnoeic syndrome.

N2  - Neonatal EEG and sleep findings are presented from a longitudinal study of the effects of maternal alcohol and marijuana use during pregnancy. Infant outcome has been examined relative to the trimester(s) of pregnancy during which use occurred. Disturbances in sleep cycling, motility, and arousals were noted that were both substance and trimester specific. Alcohol consumed during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with disruptions in sleep and arousal, whereas marijuana use affected sleep and motility regardless of the trimester in which it was used. Although these findings are preliminary and based on a small sample of women exhibiting only moderate substance use during pregnancy, they do suggest that specific neurophysiological systems may be differentially affected by prenatal alcohol and marijuana exposure even in the absence of morphological abnormalities.

N2  - We studied maternal plasma levels of oestriol (measured by radioimmunoassay) and total cortisol (measured by a protein binding method) in 11 women from 8 to 22 weeks gestation. Blood specimens (5 ml) were drawn over a 24-h period at 60 and 30 min intervals. The diurnal rhythm of cortisol with higher values in the morning than in the afternoon and evening was present at all gestational ages studied. Unconjugated plasma oestriol showed a similar circadian rhythm to maternal cortisol (r = 0.576, P < 0.01) in the 8th week. From the 9th to the 11th week oestriol values rose and there was no evidence of a circadian rhythm. In the 12th week plasma oestriol again showed a circadian rhythm, with higher values at night (117.3 ± 9.5 pg/ml) than during day-time (104 ± 7.5 pg/ml, P < 0.001). This pattern remained until the 22nd week, when plasma oestriol levels at night (3.78 ± 0.49 ng/ml) were markedly higher than in the day-time (3.16 ± 0.3 ng/ml, P < 0.001). An inverse relation between oestriol and cortisol levels as shown in late human pregnancy could not be demonstrated for the early stages we studied. The interval between rising cortisol and falling oestriol levels decreased from 6 h in the 12th week to 3.5 h in the 22nd week of gestation. This suggests an increasing sensitivity of the fetal hypothalamus to the feedback effect of maternal cortisol.

N2  - To define the dose response of apnea and breathing to morphine we studied 12 fetuses at 116-141 days of gestation using our window technique. We instrumented the fetus to record electrocortical activity (ECoG), eye movements (EOG), diaphragmatic activity (∫EMG(di)), heart rate, carotid blood pressure, and amniotic pressure. Saline and morphine in doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 3 mg/kg were injected in random order in the jugular vein of the fetus during low-voltage ECoG. Fetuses were videotaped for evaluation of fetal behavior. We found 1) that saline did not elicit a response; 2) apnea, associated with a change from low- to high-voltage ECoG, increased from 2.2 ± 1.5 (SE) min in two fetuses at a dose of 0.03 mg to 20 ± 6.3 min in seven fetuses at 3 mg/kg (P < 0.005); 3) the length of the breathing responses, associated with a change from high- to low-voltage ECoG, were 15 ± 1.8 and 135.9 ± 18.1 min (P < 0.0005); 4) ∫EMG(di) x frequency, an index equivalent to minute ventilation, increased from 1,763 ± 317 arbitrary units to 10,658 ± 1,843 at 1.0 mg/kg and then decreased to 7,997 ± 1,335 at 3.0 mg/kg. These changes were related to a steady increase in ∫EMG(di), whereas frequency decreased at 3 mg/kg. There was an increase in breathing response to morphine plasma concentrations or morphine doses. These results suggest 1) that morphine given to the fetus produces an apnea associated with a change from rapid-eye-movement (REM) to quiet sleep, followed by an increase in breathing activity that in turn coincides with a shift from quiet to REM sleep; and 2) there is a good correlation between doses of morphine or plasma concentrations and the intensity of breathing response. The initial fetal apnea was expected but the mechanisms for the late increase in breathing with morphine remains unknown.

N2  - The role of maternal circadian rhythms in the development of the fetal circadian system was investigated in the rat. Pregnant females were subjected to procedures known to disrupt circadian function, ablation of the maternal suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) or housing in constant illumination, on gestational day 10. Circadian function was assessed in fetuses at gestational day 22 by analysis of glucose utilization in hypothalamic slices in vitro using the 2-deoxyglucose method. Fetuses from control females exhibited a robust rhythm in glucose utilization in the SCN. In contrast, the SCN of fetuses from females with SCN lesions, or housed in constant illumination, show no significant day-night difference in glucose utilization. Analysis of individual brains indicates, however, that this apparent disruption in the development of circadian rhythmicity in metabolism in the fetal SCN is due to a desynchronization of individual fetuses resulting from the loss of maternal entraining influences. Thus, the fetal SCN is capable of developing a circadian rhythm in glucose utilization independent of the maternal circadian system.

N2  - Doppler flow velocity waveforms in the fetal internal carotid artery were recorded in 21 normal pregnancies during fetal behavioural state 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep) according to Nijhuis and co-workers, from the 36th week of gestation onwards. The present study confirms the earlier finding of a significant reduction of the pulsatility index (PI) in state 2F as compared to state 1F at 37-38 weeks of gestation and demonstrates that this difference in PI exists throughout the entire period, in which fetal behavioural states have been described. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that there is a significant reduction in PI of this vessel during the last 4 weeks of gestation, suggesting a haemodynamic redistribution, favouring blood supply to the brain during the latter weeks of gestation.

N2  - Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) was analysed in 25 pregnant women with trisomy 21 foetuses whose chromosomal aberration was recognized by cytogenetic study after amniocentesis. Enzyme investigation was performed at 20-22 weeks of gestation using cytochemical and biochemical techniques. Twenty-nine women at the same stage of normal pregnancies were selected as controls. In parallel, each mother was karyotyped. Ten subjects from each series underwent biochemical and immunological investigation: measurement of enzyme levels, thermostability study and immunological tests with alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme antibodies. NAP from pregnant women with trisomy 21 foetuses was characterized by: (1) a lower rate of enzyme activity, (2) a large amount of heat-stable enzyme (T = 56°C for biochemical assays, T = 85°C for cytochemical tests), and (3) a marked loss of liver antigenicity. These findings suggest the presence in trisomy 21 pregnancies of a non-specific alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme which appears as an 'enzyme marker' in maternal circulating neutrophils.

N2  - Jugular plasma concentrations of oestradiol-17β, prolactin, progesterone and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F-2α (PGFM) were measured at 2-h intervals during the last 4 days of pregnancy in 6 goats. During advanced labour and delivery, samples were obtained more frequently and assayed for oxytocin. The animals were housed in a barn with continuous dim lighting. A distinct pattern of oscillation in prolactin concentrations, with peaks during the late afternoon, was apparent during the last 3 days. Geometric means of peak concentrations doubled each day and became of longer duration; night-time nadir values remained low except during the last night before parturition. A progressive increase in oestradiol-17β, with mean levels doubling every 36 h, was apparent during the last 3 days. There was no sharp pre-partum increase in oestradiol-17β. Correlated (r = 0.83) with the increase in oestradiol-17β was a gradual increase in PGFM and when the latter reached ~1000 pg/ml, the non-reversible decline in progesterone reflecting pre-partum, luteolysis occurred. Subsequent changes in PGFM related closely to an approximately 20-fold increase in the ratio of oestradiol-17β to progesterone until maximal PGFM levels of 26.5 ± 4.2 ng/ml were reached at delivery. Basal concentrations of oxytocin (8-15 μU/ml) were measured before the last 60 min and markedly higher, though erratic, concentrations were detected at various times before appearance of the allantochorion. Maximal oxytocin values (range 180-1570 μU/ml) occurred within minutes before or after delivery of the first fetus. The results suggest that increased pre-partum production of oestradiol-17β, in addition to provoking sufficient release of prostaglandins to cause luteolysis, may modulate either the sensitivity or set-points for an endogenous rhythm in prolactin secretion at the end of pregnancy. The nature of the oxytocin changes suggest that, after labour has evolved sufficiently, delivery is precipitated by an abrupt increase in oxytocin secretion.

The baby is found dead in the cot when it was thought to be sleeping. This obviously represents a major shock for the parents. This syndrome especially affects infants between the ages of two and four months and particularly boys. The incidence in France is about two cot deaths for one thousand births and is the major cause of death of infants in the late post-natal period in industrialised countries. For this reason, a number of medical teams have studied this entity over the last decade. These studies have resulted in a better understanding of this syndrome, even if no cause can be proposed at the present time, and they have also demonstrated the impact of this death on the next child and on the family. In 1980, following the initiative of a group of patients who had lost a child from cot death, an association for the research and prevention of this syndrome was formed at the Hopital Port-Royal in Paris. This association consists of parents and a medical team undertaking research into sleep in infants. The first part of this paper presents a summary of a retrospective study of the psychomotor development of 31 cot death victims. The second part describes the possible repercussions of cot death in the family. The third part discusses the bereavement process and the following pregnancy. Lastly, the author discusses the preventative approach which can be instituted in order to avoid interactive dysharmonies or psychosomatic disorders in the following child.

N2  - The FAO/WHO/UNU recommendations for energy requirements assume that the energy cost of sleep is equal to the basal metabolic rate (BMR). We have tested the validity of this assumption by analysing overnight and BMR measurements made by whole-body indirect calorimetry. Data from 80 healthy subjects measured on a total of 246 occasions have been used. In a subgroup of 40 normal lean subjects the mean ratio of overnight metabolic rate (Overnight MR): BMR was 0.95 (range 0.85-1.02, s.d. 0.04). The mean ratio of lowest sleeping metabolic rate (Lowest SMR): BMR was 0.88 (range 0.83-0.96, s.d. 0.04). Ratios of Overnight MR:BMR were not significantly affected by different levels of exercise on the preceding day. This ratio was significantly higher for subjects who were obese, late pregnant or attached to ECG electrodes. With the exception of the late pregnant subjects these groups had the same Lowest SMR:BMR ratios as the normal lean subjects, indicating that the higher Overnight MR was caused by disturbed sleep. The data suggest that the use of BMR to estimate overnight energy expenditure would introduce an average overestimate of approximately 5 per cent during the actual hours of sleep, but that when applied over 24 h the error becomes negligible.

N2  - The nonstress test (NST) is a helpful adjunct to the management of high-risk pregnancies. However, fetal sleep states may lead to falsely nonreactive tests. We assessed the usefulness of transabdominal acoustic stimulation of the fetus and demonstrated an approximately 50% reduction in the number of nonreactive tests and a shorter testing time. No change in the predictive reliability of a reactive test was observed. With regard to the intrapartum and neonatal outcome in women delivering within seven days of a reactive test, no difference between the incidence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, depressed one- or five-minute Apgar scores or operative intervention for fetal distress could be identified. A reactive test evoked by acoustic stimulation is as reliable as the NST. It offers the additional benefits of reduced testing time and a lower incidence of nonreactive testing time and a lower incidence of nonreactive tests.

N2  - The influence of pregnancy on circadian variations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and aldosterone was studied. In those women with normal pregnancies, the mean 24-hour values of atrial natriuretic peptide and aldosterone increased, compared with the levels in normal nonpregnant subjects. In cases of severe preeclampsia, levels of atrial natriuretic peptide was significantly higher than in the other subjects, but aldosterone levels decreased to nearly those seen in the nonpregnant subjects. Atria natriuretic peptide did not establish a rhythm in normal nonpregnant and pregnant subjects, but in the studies of aldosterone levels, a clear circadian rhythm was evident. In severe cases of preeclampsia, atrial natriuretic peptide established a circadian rhythm similar to that of blood pressure, and the circadian rhythm of aldosterone disappeared. The main characteristics of the rhythm in atrial natriuretic peptide and blood pressure in women showing preeclamptic signs is that the acrophase occurred at midnight. This evidence suggests that in women with symptoms of preeclampsia the load to the atria increases at midnight.

N2  - On 25-30-day rabbit foetuses, in chronic experiments using constant synchronous recording of the motor activity and heart rate, studies have been made of temporal organization of the activity-rest cycle. Already in 25-day foetus, three functional conditions may be distinguished: active, intermediate and resting ones, the duration of the latter increasing to the end of gestation up to 8-10 min, whereas the duration of the intermediate phase decreases, reaching its minimum to the 30th day if not being completely reduced. Cyclic pattern of active and resting phases is observed in 28-day foetuses; to the 29th-30th day, these phases from a unique activity-rest cycle, its duration reaching 20-30 min to the end of intrauterine period. It is suggested that the resting phase in foetal rabbits serves as a basis for the development of polyphasic sleep in adult animals.

N2  - Post-natal manifestation of circadian rhythms was examined in individual rats in order to clarify the manner in which pups' circadian oscillation entrained to the maternal circadian system. Ablation of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a putative circadian pacemaker, completely eliminated the circadian rhythms of spontaneous locomotor activity and plasma corticosterone level in pregnant rats. However, all pups born to mothers whose SCN were lesioned at day 10 of gestation showed free-running circadian rhythms of plasma corticosterone level with similar phase angles after the 4th week of postnatal life. Strong positive correlations between the phases of circadian locomotor rhythm at the day of weaning and each free-running period (tau) were observed in blinded pups nursed under identical lighting schedule (LD). The fact suggests that the individual circadian oscillation was in phase on a certain day before the weaning. Mother-pups exchange under reversed lighting schedule (LD and DL) and nursing under 4-hourly restricted daily feeding (RF) indicated that nursing mother rat could essentially phase-set the circadian locomotor rhythm of blinded pups when the conditions during nursing were artificially modified. The weight of neonatal rats was measured every 4 hours from day 1 to day 3 and day 9 to day 10 after birth, and 4-hourly weight gains showed apparent circadian periodicity from day 2 of age. Under ad-lib feeding of mother rats, pups' weight mainly increased during daytime but the phase of weight rhythm shifted under RF corresponding to the feeding time of the mother. These findings suggest that the circadian oscillation underlying the spontaneous locomotor activity and plasma corticosterone level in rats has entrained to the maternal circadian system during fetal life, and nursing mother is capable of phase-setting the circadian oscillation of blinded pups probably through the rhythmicity of the lactation.

N2  - Genetic differences in susceptibility to fetal alcohol effects (FAE) have been suggested by both human and animal studies. The Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mouse lines, selectively bred for differences in ethanol-induced narcosis, provide a model for studying differential alcohol sensitivity in the etiology of FAE. LS and SS mice were intubated with either 2.9 g/kg (20% w/v) ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of sucrose (S) twice per day (6 hr apart) on Days 7 through 15 of pregnancy. An untreated control group (C) was maintained for each line. Offspring were fostered to lactating Rockland-Swiss mice at birth. LS offspring prenatally exposed to ethanol exhibited increased open-field activity relative to LS controls, but this effect was due to the overactivity of one litter. Activity for SS mice prenatally exposed to ethanol did not differ from control levels. Ethanol content in blood (280 mg/dl), amniotic fluid (258 mg/dl), and fetal tissue (230 mg/dl) did not differ insimilary treated LS and SS dams. In a second experiment, females were treated from Days 7 through 18 of gestation, and their offspring were tested for either open-field activity or passive avoidance learning. There were no group differences in open-field activity, but LS mice prenatally exposed to alcohol took more trials to reach a passive avoidance criterion than their controls, whereas similarly treated SS mice did not differ from controls. These results suggest that genetically-mediated sensitivity to ethanol influences susceptibility to FAE and that this may be task specific.

N2  - Alterations in circadian rhythms have previously been associated with estrous and seasonal changes in reproductive state. In the present study we explored the effects of the reproductive events of pregnancy and parturition on free-running circadian activity rhythms in the rat. Free-running rhythms were monitored before mating, during pregnancy, and following parturition and removal of pups. Systematic and long-lasting alterations of the period of the free-running activity rhythm were seen following parturition. The effects of estrous, seasonal, and gestational reproductive states on circadian rhythms may be mediated by the endocrine events which accompany these states.

N2  - Pharmacodynamic effects of [6-(5-chloro-2-pyridyl-6,7-dihydro- 7-oxo-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-5-yl]-4-methyl-1-piperazine-carboxylate (zopiclone, RP-27267), chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines and a potential new sleep inducer, on the peripheral system were investigated in several species of animals. The drug was dissolved in the vehicle of 0.01 mol/l HCl solution for intravenous administration or for addition to the bath medium and was suspended in 0.25% carboxymethylcellulose solution for oral administration. In unanesthetized rabbits, zoipiclone, 0.5 mg/kg i.v., exerted no action and at 1 mg/kg slightly decreased respiration and heart rate without affecting blood pressure and ECG. Zopiclone at 10-6 g/ml had no action in the isolated guinea-pig atria but at 10-5 g/ml it produced a gradual and slight decrease in heart rate without affecting the contraction. In the isolated small intestine of rabbits and guinea-pigs, zopiclone at 10-6 g/ml had no action but produced a slight inhibition in a dose of 10-5 g/ml. Zopiclone, 10-5 g/ml, did not affect the stimulatory effects of acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine and barium in the isolated guinea-pig intestine. Zopiclone, 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg i.v., exerted no action on rabbit intestinal movement in vivo. Zopiclone, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg/kg p.o., had no effect on the propulsive motility on the mouse intestine. Zopiclone, 10-5 g/ml, did not affect contractile movement of the uterus isolated from rabbits and did not influence the contractile response to epinephrine. In the in vivo uterine contractile movement of non-pregnant and pregnant rabbits, zopiclone, 5 and 10 mg/kg i.v., exerted little or no action, preceded by a slight temporary inhibition or excitation. In the isolated guinea-pig trachea, zopiclone, 10-5 g/ml, had no action and did not alter the stimulatory effect of acetylcholine or the inhibitory effect of isoprenaline. Zopiclone did not exert actions in the isolated guinea-pig vas deferens at 10-5 g/ml and did not influence the stimulatory effects of norepinephrine. Zopiclone, 10-6 and 10-5 g/ml, induced no alteration in the twitch tension of rat diaphragm. Zopiclone, 1 mg/kg i.v., had no effect on the bile outflow in rabbits, and doses of 10-6 and 10-5 g/ml did not evoke hemolysis. In conclusion, zopiclone exerts weak actions on peripheral systems.

N2  - We are now in a position to summarize the effects which maternal and child nutritional status and child health have on the risk of pregnancy. Most studies have indicated that maternal nutritional status has little impact on the risk of pregnancy. One study has demonstrated that maternal supplementation can be associated with a decrease in the duration of amenorrhea. There is, however, an alternative explanation for the relationship found in the study; in particular, the level of supplementation is extremely unlikely to occur except under experimental conditions. Child nutrition affects the risk of pregnancy through the frequency of both nutritive and non-nutritive suckling. Malnourished children suckle more frequently than those who are better nourished. Children receiving supplementary food by bottle have lower rates of suckling, but those who are hand fed - and who sleep with their mother at night and are fed on demand - appear to maintain high levels of suckling. When suckling is high, the risk of pregnancy is reduced, but when suckling intensity declines below threshold levels, increases in fecundity have been noted. The higher prevalence of illness in children in developing countries, with associated anorexia and deteriorating nutritional status, appears to help maintain high levels of suckling. Morbidity may, therefore, make a contribution towards reducing fertility.

N2  - The relation between the blood flow velocity waveform in the fetal internal carotid artery (n = 12) and umbilical artery (n = 15) and fetal behavioural states at 37-38 weeks of gestation was studied. In the fetal internal carotid artery, under standardized fetal heart rate conditions, the pulsatility index (PI), as a measure of peripheral vascular resistance, was significantly lower during behavioural state 2F (active sleep) compared with state 1F (quiet sleep) according to the classification by Nijhuis et al. (1982), suggesting increased fetal cerebral blood flow during state 2F. In the umbilical artery, no significant difference in PI between the two behavioural states could be established. This suggests a fetal origin of the state dependency observed in fetal blood flow velocity waveforms.

N2  - Neurotransmitters are present at very early stages of brain development. They may have trophic effects on maturation of target neurons and mediate the behavioral repertoire of the immature brain. Many centrally acting drugs which are used during pregnancy and early childhood for the treatment of e.g. hypertension, depression, epilepsy, sleep disorders, or hyperkinetism influence brain neurotransmitters and behavioral states. Disturbances observed later in life in animal and man, due to perinatal interference of such drugs with brain neurotransmitters and behavioral states, are not gross physical malformations but rather subtle behavioral and neurological symptoms such as hyperactivity, emotional lability, perceptual motor disturbances, attentional distractibility and sleep disturbances.

N2  - EEG examinations were carried out on 137 patients with thalidomide embryopathy aged between 7 and 22 with a mean age of 17.0. Waking and sleep EEGs were normal in 82 (59.9%), and abnormal in 55 (40.1%). The incidence of abnormal EEG was significantly high in the patients associated with mental retardation, and it increased in proportion to the severity of mental retardation. The most frequent abnormal EEG finding was slowing of the basic activity (35/137; 24.8%). The incidence of slowing was significantly higher in the patients with a sensorineural hearing impairment (26/74; 35.1%) than in those with dysmelia (9/62; 14.5%). Slowing appeared frequently in the patients with various cranial nerve symptoms (30/84; 35.7%). The incidence of slowing was found significantly high in the patients with borderline or subnormal intelligence (8/16; 50.0%), and it correlated with the severity of mental retardation. Many patients (48/84; 57.1%) showed unilateral or asymmetrical neurological symptoms. However, asymmetry or focal abnormality in EEG was shown in only 8 patients. Positive spikes appeared frequently in the patients with gonadal dysplasia. Other somatic symptoms, past medical history and family history were not related to the incidence of abnormal EEGs. Eight patients had had epileptic seizures prior to this examination. Another 2 patients had nocturnal enuresis and showed epileptic EEG abnormalities in this examination. The incidence of epilepsy was significantly higher in the patients we examined than among the general population. It is concluded that ingestion of thalidomide during pregnancy affected not only the morphological development of the limbs of the fetus, but the functions of its central nervous system, causing hearing impairment, other cranial nerve symptoms, mental retardation or epilepsy.

N2  - To study the role of genetic factors in the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behaviour, dams of two rat lines developed to differ in voluntary alcohol intake, alcohol-preferring (AA) and alcohol-avoiding (ANA) rats were given a 5-10% alcohol solution mixed with a 1% sucrose solution as a sole drinking liquid throughout gestation. Sleep-wake behaviour of the offspring was studied at the ages of 7, 14 and 20 days, using a movement-sensitive mattress. In ANA rats, sleep recordings showed that prenatal alcohol exposure increased the percentage of waking but decreased the percentage of active sleep. Sleep-wake behaviour of the AA rats was not affected by alcohol exposure in utero. Prenatal alcohol exposure did not change open field behaviour in 1 month old rats, except that the alcohol-exposed AA rats' defaecation was decreased. When rats were 3 months old, voluntary intake of 10% (v/v) alcohol increased for alcohol-exposed ANA rats and decreased for alcohol-exposed AA rats as compared to the controls. The results indicate that AA rats may compensate for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behaviour, whereas offspring of the alcohol-exposed ANA dams suffer from severe behavioural disturbances. These findings further suggest that genetic factors are responsible for the differences in the susceptibility of rat foetuses to alcohol-induced long-term effects on behaviour.

N2  - Pain is a primary component of normal childbirth as evidenced by the behavior of parturients in primitive societies. Methods of pain relief such as the use of herbs and plant extracts were described in ancient writings. Modern obstetric analgesia employing ether began in 1847, three months after the first successful surgical anesthetic. Administration of chloroform and nitrous oxide followed. Twilight sleep, a combination of morphine and scopolamine, became popular in the beginning of the twentieth century as did regional analgesia, first single injection and later continuous blockade via catheter. Simultaneously, psychologic methods were propagated, but were not uniformly successful. Continuous lumbar extradural analgesia has evolved as the optimal method of bsotetric pain relief, both subjectively and objectively, and its combination with childbirth education is considered to be complementary. The increasing utilization of obstetric analgesia and the recognition of marked physiologic and pharmacologic differences between pregnant and nonpregnant patients has led to the development of the subspecialty of obstetric anesthesia as well as to the foundation of obstetric anesthesia societies.

N2  - Two hundred women were interviewed within 24-36 hours after giving birth. The patients were not examined. It was found that 56% of the patients suffered from low-back pain during pregnancy. The percentage of Caucasians was statistically higher in the back pain group. The percentage of Hispanics was statistically higher in the no pain group. Among the variables that were compared in both groups were the age, the weight gained by the mothers during pregnancy, the baby's weight, the number of previous pregnancies, number of prior children. None of the vriables reached a statistically significant level. The pain group complained of pain in the low-back area, which radiated in 45.5% of cases to the lower extremities. In about one-third of the patients the pain increased as the day wore on, whereas in another one-third the pain increased during the night and disturbed sleep. Standing, sitting, forward bending, lifting, and walking tended to increase the pain. Most of the patients started suffering from back pain between the fifth and seventh months of pregnancy. Several theories to explain the occurrence of backache during pregnancy are discussed.

N2  - The effect of reducing the dietary protein content at different stages of development was investigated. A group of control rats was fed a diet with 25% protein throughout the entire study. Four other groups were fed only 6% protein in a diet isocaloric with the control diet. In an "intrauterine"-deprivation (prenatal) group, the feeding of the low protein diet was limited to the span from mating to delivery. In a "postnatal"-deprivation (lactation) group, the reduced protein diet was limited to the 25 days allowed for lactation. In a "perinatal"-deprivation group, the low-protein diet was fed during both the pregnancy and the 25 days after birth. Protein deprivation in a "preperinatal" group started 1 month before mating and continued throughout gestation and lactation to day 25 after birth. Except for the perinatal group, consisting of two animals, other groups consisted each of three or four rats. Behavioral variables--activity, rest, eating, drinking, exploring, grooming, curling up, and lying down--were studied in rats from each group at 90 days of age for 3 days at consecutive near-12-min intervals for observation spans of 1 min. Two animals subjected to bilateral suprachiasmatic lesions, subsequently validated histologically, and two sham-operated controls were also investigated. Both the population-mean and the single cosinor methods were used for data analysis in conjunction with linear least-squares spectra. Cosinor methods allow the rejection of the zero-amplitude assumption on a group basis for the intact controls (P = 0.007), the intrauterine malnutrition group (P = 0.034), the lactation group (P = 0.059), the preperinatal group (P = 0.055), and on an individualized basis for the two animals constituting the perinatal group (P = 0.007 and 0.002). These results by population-mean cosinor are complemented by the single cosinor demonstration of rhythms for most animals and variables investigated. The results demonstrate, on an individualized basis, the persistence of circadian rhythms under differently timed conditions of protein malnutrition. The data on the behavior of rats with bilateral lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei show a circadian to ultradian variance transposition. In most behaviors, there are prominent ultradian rhythms, which, however, require study over longer spans with dense observations on additional animals.

N2  - In many seasonally breeding species, the nocturnal melatonin rhythm is part of an endogenous biological clock mediating information about day length to time the onset of puberty and the annual adult reproductive cycle. To determine whether timekeeping persists during pregnancy, we studied the pattern of melatonin in circulation in sheep during the last trimester of gestation. We measured plasma melatonin concentrations in the chronically catheterized ewe and fetus (n = 6) over a 48-h period (every 1-4 h) at ~120 days gestation. A typical rhythm was present in the pregnant ewes; plasma melatonin was low during the day and remained increased throughout the night. In the fetus, a modest 24-h pattern was detected, which lagged 0.5-1.5 h behind that of the maternal circulation. In combination with findings later in gestation (126 and 135 days) or even during parturition, it is clear that melatonin rhythms were sustained in all pregnant ewes and a 24-h pattern was present in the fetus. In those sheep that went to full term, births occurred during the night at 0130 ± 2.6 h (mean ± SE, n = 3). These findings suggest that measurement of day length is maintained in female sheep during the last trimester of pregnancy. Moreover, information about day length is maintained in female sheep during the last trimester of pregnancy. Moreover, information about day length and/or time of day may be transferred across the placenta, because the pattern of melatonin in fetal circulation follows the maternal circadian melatonin rhythm.

N2  - A regular count of perceived fetal movements by the mother has been proposed as a screening method for the early recognition of fetal distress. Abscence or a strongly decreased number of fetal movements during a particular period is considered as a sign of fetal distress. In the study presented, the optimal duration of a recording period for the maternal perception of fetal movements was examined. 186 pregnant patients at gestational ages of 32 and 38 weeks were asked to mark each perceived fetal movement on a time axis for two contionuous hours. From these patients an 'optimal group'of 143 pregnancies was selected to constitute the study group. A window technique was applied to the 2 h recordings, searching for periods in which 0, 1 or 2 fetal movements were noted. 23% of the recordings at 32 weeks and 14% at 38 weeks showed abscence of fetal movements for at least 30 min. At both 32 weeks and 38 weeks there was abscence of fetal movements for at least 30 min. At both 32 weeks and 38 weeks there was absence of fetal movements for more than 1 h in only 1.5% of the recordings. The findings are in agreement with the fetal behavioural state concept. A recording time of 1 h exceeds the normal duration of a fetal quiet-sleep state and minimizes the risk of unjustified suspicion of fetal distress.

N2  - Fetal heart rate and fetal movements were recorded over a 24-hour interval in a totally adrenalectomized pregnant woman at term. Cortisol, ACTH, unconjugated estriol and 17β-estradiol were contemporaneously measured every 2 h in the maternal peripheral plasma. Owing to the substitution therapy the patient showed a loss of circadian variations of all the hormones investigated. Moreover, the circadian rhythms of fetal heart rate and fetal movements, usually present at term, were no longer evident. We can thus suggest that the circadian variations of plasma maternal cortisol could affect the alternations of fetal behaviour.

N2  - Phase setting of the circadian rhythm by restricted daily feeding (RF) was examined in rat pups. Feeding of virgin, pregnant, and nursing rats together with pups was restricted to 4 h at a fixed time of the day. Phases of the circadian rhythm developed in neonatally blinded pups were measured on the day of weaning to evaluate the effect of RF on phase setting. The activity onset and offset of the locomotor rhythm were used for the phase reference. In blinded pups born and raised under ad libitum feeding, the phase at weaning was a function of the free-running period measured after weaning and located in a narrow range (control zone). When RF was imposed from 2 wk prior to the conception (C), until weaning (3w), the pups phases were located outside the control zone and related to the feeding time. To identify the period in which the phase setting is effective, RF was imposed during 5 different periods (C-Ow, C-1w, C-2w, 2-6w, and 3-6w). The circadian rhythm of all pups in the C-2w group and some in the C-1w was phase set, but those in other groups were not affected. It is concluded that RF imposed during the early nursing period is capable of phase setting the circadian system of blinded infant rats.

N2  - 1. The experiments were aimed at determining the means by which lung liquid volume is controlled in fetal sheep. Six unanaesthetized chronically catheterized fetuses between 121 and 144 days of gestation were used in experiments in which lung liquid volume was acutely reduced or increased. 2. The effects on lung liquid volume, secretion and flow in the trachea were continuously monitored until the original volume was restored. Tracheal pressure, breathing activity, electrocortical activity and laryngeal adductor muscle activity were also monitored. 3. Following a mean reduction in lung liquid volume of 54.1% (40.0 ± 4.3 ml) there was a reduction in tracheal pressure of 1.91 ± 0.26 mmHg. There was no change in the rate of lung liquid secretion and there was a near cessation in its rate of efflux from the trachea. Influx of liquid from the upper airway was rarely seen. 4. 5 h after its reduction, lung liquid volume had returned to control values. Tracheal pressure and the rate of liquid flow in the trachea returned to control values over 7-8 h. 5. In the hour following the reduction in lung liquid volume the incidence and amplitude of fetal inspiratory muscle electromyogram (e.m.g.) activity were reduced by 19% and 28% respectively. There was no change in laryngeal adductor muscle activity or in the duration of fetal sleep states. 6. When lung liquid volume was increased by 25.4 ± 3.1 ml tracheal pressure increased by 2.01 ± 0.17 mmHg. Although there was no change in the rate of liquid secretion there was a rapid efflux of liquid from the trachea principally during epochs of fetal breathing activity thus returning lung liquid volume to its control value. 7. Following the increase in lung liquid volume there were no changes in the incidence or amplitude of fetal inspiratory muscle activity, the activity of laryngeal adductor muscles or in the duration of sleep states. 8. It is concluded that following its alteration in fetal sheep lung liquid volume is restored by passive means. There was no evidence of volume-receptive neural reflexes being activated in defense of lung liquid volume.

N2  - The authors examined 52 women with recurrent depression to determine the differences between women with and without histories of pregnancy-related affective episodes. The women with histories of such episodes (N = 24) had been significantly younger at illness onset, were more severely depressed at baseline, and tended to show less emotional stability. The EEG-recorded sleep of the women with pregnancy-related affective episodes was distinguished by longer REM sleep time and more REM activity, differences accounted for almost entirely by the women with histories of only postpartum episodes.

N2  - Fetal behavior was studied after intravenous administration of either 0.4 mg of naloxone or an equal volume of saline solution in 54 healthy pregnant women near term. The number, duration, and amplitude of fetal heart rate accelerations increased after naloxone injection. The incidence of both gross fetal body movements and fetal breathing movements increased, especially in the first hour after naloxone administration. The distribution of fetal behavioral states was modified with a prevalence of active sleep and active awake states compared to the quiet sleep state. These data suggest that endorphins could be involved in the modulation of fetal behavior.

N2  - Twenty-five pregnant women between 36 and 40 weeks' gestational age were studied to examine effects of a 5-second external vibratory acoustic stimulus on the fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variability. There was an immediate significant increase in the basal heart rate, which persisted for 1 hour after the stimulus, compared to that of the control subjects. There was also a significant increase in the total time during which accelerations occurred for the first 20 minutes after the stimulus. There were no changes in computer-derived indices of fetal heart rate variability. Maternal blood pressure and heart rate were not altered following vibratory acoustic stimulus. We hypothesize that external vibratory acoustic stimulus causes a change from a state of sleep to a state of wakefulness in near term healthy fetuses.

N2  - A male infant was born to a mother who had been suffering from primary hyperaldosteronism with the administration of alpha-methyldopa (MD) during pregnancy. His behavioral development, especially that of sleep, was studied by means of sleep-awake rhythm and polysomnography recordings (PSG) from 2 months to 2 years and 5 years and 5 months of age. his daily sleep-awake rhythm showed some abnormal pattern. As to the PSG, the proportion of each sleep stage was normal and the two types of body movements (BM) showed various patterns. A paradoxical increase was seen in the twitch movement of some muscles. MD affects the catecholamine system in the CNS and human sleep. Since the sleep-awake rhythm and BM are thought to be related to the monoaminergic system in the CNS, we assume that his behavior and sleep disorders are the effects of the maternal MD administration during pregnancy.

N2  - Transmission of information in the brain is of a chemical nature. Neurotransmitters are present at very early stages of brain development, having trophic effects on maturation of target neurons as well as mediating the behavioral repertoire of the immature brain. Many centrally acting psychoactive drugs which are commonly used (also during pregnancy) for treatment of depression, asthma, hypertension, epilepsy, parkinsonism, hyperkinetism and other neurological and psychiatric disorders act directly on brain neurotrasmitters (in particular monoamines) and behavioral states. Disturbances observed later in life in animals and man, as a result of early interference with brain neurotransmitters, using these drugs, are not gross physical malformations but are in fact subtle behavioral and neurological symptoms such as hyperactivity, emotional lability, attentional distractability and sleep disturbances, similar to symptoms observed in the minimal brain dysfunction syndrome.

N2  - The effect of type I and II diabetes in pregnancy on the circadian rhythm and diurnal excursion of plasma cortisol was studied in the second and third trimesters and post partum. Cosignor analysis demonstrated persistence during gestation of the significant circadian rhythm of the nonpregnant state. As previously reported in control pregnancies, plasma cortisol levels (24-hour mean, nadir, peak, and nadir-peak excursion) increased during gestation while the relative excurson of cortisol (expressed as the percent deviation from the 24-hour mean) was blunted. No significant difference was found between diabetic groups or when diabetic groups were compared with control subjects. Nocturnal hypoglyciemia was common among diabetic women during pregnancy and post partum. Although these episodes were usually asymptomatic, the mean concomitant cortisol levels were increased over the corresponding cortisol levels of nonhypoglycemic diabetic and control subjects. We conclude that differences between control and type I and II diabetic subjects in carbohydrate tolerance or glycemic excursion are not explained by differences in cortisol levels or rhythym. The pregnancy-associated blunting of the excursion of cortisol is consistent with an autonomous source of adrenocorticotropin. Asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia is common in insulin-requiring diabetic women and is associated with increased cortisol secretion.

N2  - In order to verify whether fetal and maternal adrenal gland suppression induces effects on fetal behaviour, triamcinolone was administered to five healthy pregnant women at 35 weeks of gestation. Five patients of the same gestational age were used as control. Fetal heart rate (FHR) and fetal movements were recorded continuously over 2-h interval by means of cardiotocography. After 3 weeks (38 weeks of gestation) the recordings were repeated without drug administation. Cortisol, adrenocorticotropin hormone, 17 β-estradiol and unconjugated estriol were measured at the same time every 2 h in maternal peripheral plasma. At 35 weeks we found a loss of circadian rhythms of the hormones investigated and modifications of ultradian and circadian patterns of FHR in the treated group with respect to the control. No differences in hormonal and biophysical parameters were found between the two groups after the end of treatment (38 weeks). These data suggest that the inhibition of fetal and maternal adrenal glands could cause modifications of FHR patterns.

N2  - Fetal cardiorespiratory changes during spontaneous prelabor uterine contractions (called contractures) were studied in 12 chronically catheterized fetal sheep at 120 to 143 days' gestation. During contractures the carcass blood flow increased significantly from 27 ± 2 (SEM) to 32 ± 3 ml/min/100 gm. There were no significant changes in combined ventricular output or in blood flow to the umbilical circulation, brain, heart, adrenal glands, gut, kidney, and lung. Fetal arterial blood pressure increased from 57 ± 2 to 62 ± 1 mm Hg (p < 0.001) during contractions. There were no significant changes in fetal heart rate. In the fetal femoral artery during contractures the oxygen content decreased from 6.1 ± 0.2 to 5.4 ± 0.2 ml/dl of blood (p < 0.001), and carbon dioxide tension increased significantly from 44 ± 0.4 to 45 ± 0.4 mm Hg (p < 0.001). The pH did not change. The increase in carcass blood flow during contractures suggests that there was an increase in fetal skeletal muscular activity or tone. An increase in fetal skeletal muscle activity, together with a decrease in uterine blood flow could explain the small decrease in fetal oxygen content that occurs with each contracture. Fetal compression and/or changes from rapid eye movement to synchronized sleep or arousal observed during contractures are possible stimuli causing increased fetal skeletal muscle tone or activity. Since contractures periodically result in neuromuscular activity in the fetus in its protected fluid-filled environment, they may play a key role in fetal neuromuscular development by stimulating 'exercising' in the fetus in utero.

N2  - We have studied carbohydrate absorption in 40 healthy term infants and 10 preterm neonates (31-35 weeks gestation) by respiratory H2, fecal pH, and chromatographic analysis of stools. Sequential studies of H2 excretion (24-h collection) in response to breast feeding were carried out in premature infants during the first 8 weeks of life. Five expired H2 during the first 2 weeks, and two continued to do so in the 3rd to 4th weeks. Breath H2 excretion fell below 10 ppm by 8 weeks and was not related to feeding or sleep. In term neonates, the frequency of incomplete carbohydrate absorption (4-h test) at the end of the first week was 36% for 14 breast-fed. 42% for 12 formula-fed, and 64% for 14 mixed-fed neonates (not significant differences). There were no significant differences between the absorbing and malabsorbing subjects in fecal pH. Chromatographic analysis showed only small quantities of sugars. In summary, incomplete carbohydrate absorption occurred in a high percentage of the newborns studied; the 24-h test evaluated better than the 4-h test; and negative breath H2 excretion indicated development of the capacity of the small intestine to hydrolyze carbohydrates. In the majority of the preterm malabsorbing babies, completely functional lactase occurs within the first month of life. The growth modulators in human milk may increase the rate of maturing of the small intestine.

N2  - Twenty-five pregnant women between 36 and 40 weeks' gestational age were studied to examine effects of a 5-second external vibratory acoustic stimulus on fetal breathing and gross fetal body movement patterns. When the study period was compared with the control period, there was an immediate significant decrease in the incidence of fetal breathing movements that persisted for 1 hour after the stimulus. Moreover the fetal breathing pattern was more irregular for the hour after the stimulus. There was also a significant but delayed increase in the incidence of gross fetal body movements that persisted for 1 hour after the stimulus. We hypothesize that an external vibratory acoustic stimulus causes a change from a state of sleep to a state of wakefulness in near-term healthy fetuses.

N2  - The effect of repeated and prolonged stress-stimuli applied during 3 days on the plasma prolactin concentration in sheep, in anoestrous, prooestrous and pregnant animals were studied. The following results were obtained: 1. Repeated and prolonged weak electric stimuli applied in the form of footshocks in sheep during 3 days elicited a rise of mesor plasma concentration. The magnitude and the onset of this rise was not associated and dependent on the physiological state of animals. 2. The mesor values of plasma prolactin concentration in all groups of animals except prooestrous ewes on the day following stimulation returned to their prestressing levels. 3. Repeated and prolonged stimuli disturbed circadian rhythm of prolactin secretion existing only in prooestrous ewes, i.e. they caused its disappearance on the days during stimulation and its reappearance on the day following stimulation but at an accelerated and inverse time of the day to that found before stimulation. 4. The induced rise of plasma prolactin concentration in anoestrous and pregnant ewes on the days during electric stimulation showed, according to Cosinor analysis, all features characteristic for acrophase of the circadian rhythm. This phenomenon may be considered as induced acrophase in stress condition.

N2  - During late fetal and early neonatal life, the maternal circadian system coordinates the timing of a circadian clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) to the prevailing light-dark cycle. The role of the maternal SCN in the process of maternal coordination was investigated in rats. Complete lesions of the maternal SCN on day 7 of gestation disrupted rhythms of SCN glucose utilization in fetuses and pineal N-acetyltransferase activity in 10-d-old pups. This disruption was probably due to the desynchronization of individually oscillating fetal SCN, because individual pups born to and reared by SCN-lesioned dams under constant conditions exhibited normal circadian rhythms in drinking behavior. Cross-foster studies showed that the maternal circadian system can coordinate developing circadian rhythmicity during either the pre- or postnatal period. The results indicate that the maternal SCN are a necessary component of the mechanism of maternal coordination during both the pre- and postnatal periods.

N2  - Some 8% of Swiss citizens travel in the deeveloping countries annually. Advising these travellers is an important task for the physician, though the most frequent infections are the less serious travellers' diarrhea and common colds. To some extent the more serious tropical diseases can be avoided by appropriate measures, e.g. vaccination (against yellow fever, tetanus, polio etc.) and by chemoprophylaxis (malaria). Individual fitness for travel should be checked prior to any journey abroad, and special advice must be given to travellers with special risks (e.g. pregnant women, infants, persons with chronic diseases, diabetics etc.). Most important during a stay in the tropics is a sensible way of life with enough sleep, general hygiene, especially with regard to food, and avoidance of untreated water. Further safety measures are recommended for bathing, strong sun exposure, mountaineering above 10,000 ft and in general for exposure to special health risks. Recognition of risks and their avoidance is often the best prophylaxis.

N2  - Possible negative effects of maternal antiepileptic medication on fetal motility and heart rate patterns were examined at 32 and 38 wk of gestation. Fetal eye and body movements were recorded using 2 real-time ultrasound units. Comparison between pregnancies with antiepileptic medication and control pregnancies did not show marked differences in pattern of motility and heart rate. Duration of sleep states, occurrence and duration of body movements in state 2F and statistical parameters of heart rate level and heart rate variability were very similar for both groups. This preliminary study, limited to mostly combined treatment with antiepileptic drugs, could not demonstrate any obvious effect on fetal neuromuscular development from maternal antiepileptic medication.

N2  - Experiments were done on chronically prepared fetal lambs, 125-135 days gestation, to test the effects of various catecholamines on fetal breathing (FB) as well as the influence of isoproterenol on the fetal respiratory response to hypoxemia. Bolus injections of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol (5-20 μg) were administered via the lingual artery or femoral or jugular vein during periods of FB activity or apnea. The effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine on FB were variable and not statistically significant. Isoproterenol produced a significant increase in FB, frequency of breathing, and mean inspiratory effort, when infused during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep but it failed to induce FB during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. The positive response during REM sleep was absent following pretreatment with 3-5 mg propranolol and after bilateral section of the sinus nerves. The effect of hypoxia on FB was tested before and during constant infusion of isoproterenol (1 μg/min iv). A reduction of the fetal arterial Po2 by 3-10 Torr produced the characteristic depression of FB in either situation. These results indicate that the fetal carotid body chemoreceptors can reflexly stimulate FB under certain circumstances but that their effectiveness is limited by more powerful inhibitory mechanisms such as those operative during NREM sleep and hypoxemia.

N2  - The effects of opiate receptor antagonism by naltrexone hydrochloride on the biphasic hypoxic ventilatory response in the infant Macaca nemestrina have been investigated. Minute ventilation, tidal volume, and respiratory frequency were measured in six animals from timed gestations before and during inhalation of a hypoxic gas mixture. All studies were completed in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. Arterial blood gases were obtained during each stimulus period. All animals demonstrated the typical biphasic ventilatory response to acute moderate-severe hypoxemia. After the administration of naltrexone hydrochloride to block opiate receptors, the animals still manifested a biphasic hypoxic response that was no different than that noted prior to drug administration. Naltrexone hydrochloride had no effect on room air resting ventilation in any of the animals. Our data suggest that endogenous opiates play no physiological role in the acute ventilatory response to moderate-severe hypoxia in the newborn subhuman primate.

N2  - Our previous experiments showed that suppression of early postnatal active (REM) sleep increases alcohol intake in adult rats. To study the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on neonatal sleep-wake behaviour and adult alcohol consumption pregnant rat dams were given 7% to 12% alcohol, 1% sucrose solution, or tap water as a sole liquid throughout gestation. Sleep-wake behaviour of the pups was studied at 6, 8, 12 and 15 days of age by using a movement sensitive mattress. The offspring who were exposed to alcohol in utero had significantly less active sleep and more wakefulness for total recording time than the controls. Their quiet state was also interrupted more often by waking episodes. At the age of 2 months voluntary alcohol intake of the rats exposed prenatally to alcohol was elevated compared to the controls. These findings suggest that early postnatal active sleep and the neurotransmitter systems regulating it may be the means by which in utero alcohol exposure affects adult alcohol drinking.

N2  - A survey of 67 pregnancies in 51 professional women (physicians, psychologists, nurses, administrators, etc.) revealed the occurrence of symptoms of cognitive dysfunction such as forgetfulness, disorientation, confusion and reading difficulties in 28 pregnancies occurring in 21 women. These were unrelated to such factors as age of delivery, percentage weight gain, the baby's sex or birth weight, alcohol comsumption, smoking, a history of migraine or allergy or other symptoms occurring during pregnancy such as sleepiness and lack of concentration, irritability, loss of interest in job or nightmares. Nor was there any correlation with hypertension, proteinuria, glycosuria, ketonuria, anemia, or morning sickness. Furthermore, these cognitive disturbances were not related to depression or sleep deprivation. Despite these symptoms, none of the women suffering from them were forced to interrupt their professional activities during pregnancy. The syndrome of benign encephalopathy of pregnancy should be recognized so that simple precautions can be taken to prevent any interference with professional or other activities. The etiology of the syndrome is unknown.

N2  - Physiologic changes during the last trimester of pregnancy include reduced functional residual capacity and residual volume, increased alveolar-arterial difference for oxygen, and in the supine position reduced cardiac output. In conjunction with sleep-related apnea or hypoventilation, these could lead to maternal oxygen desaturation during sleep. Because we could not find detailed respiratory sleep studies in late pregnancy, we performed complete polysomnography on 6 pregnant women at 36 wk gestation and again postpartum. Contrary to what we expected, oxygenation was well maintained, with neither mean nor minimal arterial oxygen saturation significantly different during pregnancy. Frequency of apnea and hypopnea and total apnea and hypopnea time were significantly reduced during pregnancy. This finding may be due to increased levels of progesterone during pregnancy and may contribute to preservation of maternal oxygenation during late pregnancy.

N2  - Chronic intrauterine monitoring of electrocortical activity, eye movements,m and electromyographic activity of the nuchal muscles has permitted the use of established polygraphic criteria to study the ontogenetic development of organized sleep-wake patterns in the fetal lamb in utero. Sixty-five polygraphic recordings obtained from 21 fetal lambs ranging from 112 to 144 days of gestation (term = 145 days) were analyzed. The results show that the transition from disorganized to organized behavioral state patterns occurs at ~ 115-120 days (0.8 term). The physiologic characteristics of the arousal, quiet sleep (QS), and REM sleep (REMS) states are qualitatively similar to those in the adult. There is initially a high proportion of REMS (>50%), with only 11% time spent in arousal. The direct transition from arousal to REMS without a QS period is frequently seen in the fetus at all ages. Quantitative changes in the distribution of behavioral states continue throughout gestation. There is a significant decrease in the incidence of REMS, with a small increase in arousal and QS. The duration of QS and REMS episodes increase with age until a steady level is achieved by 130 days. There is also an increase in the frequency of occurrence of arousal periods, with no change in episode duration.

N2  - We have developed techniques for chronic recording of electrocortical activity in the fetal and neonatal guinea pig with subsequent power spectral analysis. Thirty-four unanesthesized, unrestrained pregnant Hartley guinea pigs were studied 1 to 14 days following surgical procedures. Twelve neonatal animals, instrumented during the first week of life were studied at 3 to 30 days. Spontaneous, undifferentiated electrocortical activity was recorded from the youngest fetuses studied, with high-voltage slow activity appearing at 50 days' gestation. Cycling electrocortical activity and sleep spindles could be observed in the late-term fetal and neonatal animals, with rapid eye movements and behavioral state defined in the latter. Power spectral analysis demonstrated more predominant delta activity, faster beta frequencies, and better-developed sleep spindles in the neonatal animal as compared to the fetus.

N2  - To examine the modulation of fetal systolic time intervals of the ovine fetus in relation to fetal maturation, heart rate, respiratory activity, and circadian rhythm, studies were carried out on 13 fetal-maternal sheep preparations. The data obtained showed that there was a significant correlation between the ejection time (ET) and the RR intervals of the electrocardiogram. The pre-ejection period (PEP) and PEP/ET increased in relation to the fetal maturation (38 ms and 0.25 at 120 days to 52 ms and 0.33 at 145 days of gestation, respectively). When the circadian rhythmicity was analyzed, a relative tachycardia was in evidence during the 21- to 03-h period but systolic time intervals remained unchanged. Except for some tachycardia and cardiac rhythm variability, respiratory activity also had no influence on the systolic time intervals.

N2  - Many centrally acting drugs which are prescribed for hypertension, depression, epilepsy, insomnia and asthma may also affect fetal brain neurotransmission and behavioral states. Nearly all these drugs enter the fetal circulation following maternal administration. The immaturity of the blood-brain barrier and greater accumulation in the developing brain make the fetal brain a major target of its mother's medication. Adverse effects that are seen in the fetus are not necessarily evident in its mother. The authors have shown that drugs like clonidine (an antihypertensive) and clomipramine (an antidepressant), which act on noradrenaline and serotonin neurotransmission in the brain, suppress rapid eye movement sleep in the developing rat. In adulthood, the neonatally treated rats showed hyperactivity, hyperanxiety, reduced sexual behavior, disturbed sleep patterns, and reduced cerebral cortical size. Furthermore, such treatment induced an increase in voluntary alcohol consumption and a decreased adaptability of responses to changes in water deprivation in a Y-maze. Little is known about long-lasting consequences of centrally acting drugs used during late gestation in humans. Minor neurological disturbances, such as delayed visual motor performance, smaller head circumference, increased anxiety and disturbed sleep-wake patterns, have been reported in children born to hypertensive mothers treated with clonidine or alpha-methyl-dopa.

N2  - Noise-induced hearing loss due to intense and long-term noise exposure is no longer disputed since the etiology is well defined. However, the influence of noise on the vegetative functions is not so clear. In addition to existing investigations on vegetative functional disturbances, the role of noise as a risk factor has to be determined and its effects have to be quantified. The significance of noise-induced sleep disturbances in relation to health and well-being, is also controversial. The hypothesized causal connection between acoustical stimulation and the occurrence of disorders, includes primary-effects (e.g. awakenings) and after-effects (e.g. changes in mood or performance). To date, it has not been feasible to determine late after-effects, such as health disorders. The most often reported sociopsychological effect of noise is general annoyance, whereby annoyance is defined as disturbance of communication, rest, recreation or concentration. Some results indicate a higher sensitivity of critical groups (e.g. old people, the sick, children, pregnant women).

N2  - Plasma levels of GH, LH and FSH were measured in 74 three-day-old newborn infants with hyperbilirubinemia before and after exposure to continuous phototherapy (PhT) for 48 h. The results obtained were compared with data observed over the same period of time in 46 newborn infants belonging to the control group having homogeneous characteristics as far as form of delivery (spontaneous), gestation age, chronological age, sex, birth weight and basal blood glucose were concerned, except hyperbilirubinemia and necessity of PhT. Hyperbilirubinemic female newborn showed higher plasma GH concentrations in comparison with hyperbilirubinemic males and with controls. Forty-eight h of continuous PhT significantly reduced GH levels which, however, appeared not to be substantially different from those of normal controls of the same age. Moreover, PhT determined a slight trend to increase in FSH of females, and did not modify the physiological decline of LH in both sexes during the first five days of life. The reductions of GH following PhT from abnormal to physiological concentrations may be due to the direct effect of light and/or to continuous light-related disorders of sleep. In conclusion, 48 h of continuous exposure to light (PhT) do not impair the newborn's pituitary functions here studied.

N2  - Behavioral states in the near-term human fetus have been described during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to observe whether these same states are present during labor. Nine patients with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies participated. Fetal heart rate and uterine contractions were recorded. Fetal eye, mouth, rotation, and retroflexion of the head were observed by real-time ultrasound. Fetal movements were recorded with coded event-markers. Behavioral states were identified by the movement pattern. A total of 13 ultrasound observations, varying from 25 to 66 minutes, were obtained. Optimal viewing was present at least 60% and on the average 80% of the time. State 1F (quiet sleep), state 2F (active sleep), and state 3F (quiet awake), as well as a total of 10 state changes, were identified during labor in spite of increasing contractions and/or ruptured membranes. These observations demonstrate existence of alternating behavioral states in the healthy term fetus during labor.

N2  - Idiopathic apnea in preterm infants, more than 30 weeks of gestation, after the first week of life is uncommon and poorly understood. To study ventilatory control in these infants we measured minute ventilation, respiratory frequency, tidal volume, end-tidal oxygen pressure and carbon dioxide pressure, and transcutaneous oxygen pressure before and during the fifth minute of breathing 4% carbon dioxide in air. Nine healthy preterm infants and eight infants with three or more episodes of apnea (≥20 s) in 24 hours were studied during active sleep. We found that infants with apnea had a significantly increased alveolar carbon dioxide pressure while respiratory frequency, minute ventilation, and slope were significantly decreased. Alveolar-transcutaneous oxygen gradients were essentially unchanged. These preterm infants with apnea have a decreased carbon dioxide sensitivity. They have a decreased minute ventilation primarily as a result of decreased respiratory frequency and their alveolar-transcutaneous oxygen gradient is normal. Our findings suggest that the major deficit in these infants is a central disturbance in the regulation of breathing.

N2  - We studied the ontogeny and temporal organization of non-nutritive sucking during active sleep in 6 healthy preterm infants (mean birthweight 1.1 kg (range 0.8-1.3 kg) gestational age 28.6 weeks (range 26-30 w)) from 30 to 35 weeks of post-menstrual (PM) age. Recognizable rhythmical sucking bursts were recorded at 28 weeks in one infant and by 31-33 weeks in the others. Results were analyzed for the periods 30-31, 32-33 and 34-35 PM weeks. The number of bursts/min increased with age, while the duration of each burst was stable (mean 4.1 s). The pause between bursts decreased. Sucking pace within bursts increased with age which resulted in an increase in the overall rate of sucking. The coefficient of variation (CV) for intersuck time within bursts and for interburst time was computed to examine the stability of the sucking rhythm. For intersuck time the CV was relatively low and constant across ages. However, for interburst time CV was relatively large across ages. Thus, there appears to be a stability of the intraburst sucking rhythm from 30 weeks of gestation, whereas the interburst rhythm is less regular. This documentation of temporal organization in sucking from 30 weeks is one of the earliest indications of an intrinsic rhythm in human behavior.

N2  - In a prospective study estriol, estradiol, progesterone, human placental lactogen (HPL), prolactin and SP1 (a placental glycoprotein specific for pregnancy) concentrations were calculated in the second half of uncomplicated pregnancies in order to answer the question if there exists a circadian rhythm of these hormones in serum. All serum concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassays at 8.00, 10.00, 16.00, 20.00, 24.00 and 4.00 o'clock. 58 pregnant women with uncomplicated pregnancies show no circardian rhythm of serum levels of estriol, progesterone, HPL and SP1, while serum levels of estradiol and prolactin have significant circadian rhythm. The estradiol serum levels are significantly higher at 8.00 and 12.00 o'clock, and significantly lower at 24.00 and 4.00 o'clock. The prolactin serum levels are significant lower at 16.00 and 20.00 and at 4.00 and 8.00 significantly higher. In 20 pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia and 12 pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth retardation serum levels of all hormones were measured at 8.00, 10.00, 16.00, 20.00, 24.00 and 4.00 o'clock. The serum concentrations in complicated pregnancies show no difference from the serum levels in uncomplicated pregnancies.

N2  - Two hundred and twenty-three case records of patients with toxaemia of pregnancy were analysed in order to try to establish the ability to predict through clinical and biological assessments of the mother the prognosis for the fetus. Statistical analysis methods were chosen to work out the classification of the parameters and to lead to an index of severity that could be established by multifactorial discriminating analysis. This study confirms that there is an inversion in the circadian rhythm of arterial blood pressure, with an increase in the evening and at night. It shows how bad prognostically blood pressure instability is. On the other hand oedema of the legs is of no significance. Contrary to the view that has been held for a long time, an increase in weight is directly proportional to fetal parameters. As far as parameters are concerned as a whole (both clinical and biological) a rise in blood urea is more discriminating at every stage of the illness and precedes an increase in the platelet count, the changes in creatinine clearance and night blood pressure. Maternal changes are better correlated with fetal variability before the 35th week of pregnancy whereas after that date the prognostic value of these readings is of little importance.

N2  - Ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (EGdiME), diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diEGdiME), triethylene glycol dimethyl ether (triEGdiME), diethylene glycol diethyl ether (diEGdiEE), ethylenethiourea (ETU), sodium selenite (SS), dimethyl phthalate (DMP), naphthalene (NAP), or p-nitrophenol (PNP) were administered by gavage for eight consecutive days to female CD-1 mice. Weight loss was insensitive as an index of sublethal adult toxicity and was inadequate for determining a maximum tolerated dose. LD50 values indicate that SS, NAP, and PNP were more toxic (8.4, 353.6, and 625.7 mg/kg, respectively) than the polyglycol ethers, ETU, and DMP (LD50 values ranged from 2525.8 to 6281.9 mg/kg). Each of the compounds was administered on d 7 through 14 to pregnant animals at a single dose estimated to be at or just below the threshold of adult lethality. In such a reproductive study, each of the compounds could be categorized on the basis of the pattern of maternal lethality and fetotoxicity which it produced. The number of dams with complete resorptions was significantly increased after administration of ETU, and no mice in the EGdiME-, diEGdiME-, or triEGdiME-treated groups delivered any viable offspring. Maternal lethality was significant in the EGdiME, triEGdiME, PNP, and NAP groups. There was a slight reduction in the average number of live pups per litter in the diEGdiEE- and PNP-treated groups and a significant reduction in the NAP group. The number dead per litter was increased with diEGdiEE. SS and DMP had no effect on maternal or fetal survival at the doses administered. Individual pup weight at d 1 postpartum was only significantly reduced by diEGdiEE, and no gross congenital abnormalities were detected in neonates from any treatment group. These results provide guidelines for the subsequent toxicity testing of these chemicals.

N2  - The authors suggest an indirect evaluation of the electrocortical activity of the fetus by looking at evidence of cyclical variations in fetal cardiac rhythm. These show up by periodic changes in the variability of the rhythm. The narrow association that has been established between small changes in episodes of cardiac rhythm and deep sleep - which is itself evidence of satisfactory cortical development - make this type of tracing, under certain conditions, an excellent sign of fetal well being. This means that the value of small variabilities in fetal heart rhythm takes on greater importance as a prognostic feature.

N2  - Recording the fetal cardiac rhythm (FCR) is currently the technique most widely used to assess the well being of the fetus. In view of the importance of the decisions taken on the modifications of the FCR, the authors have recorded and analysed over 24 consecutive hours 10 resting women manifesting a strictly normal pregnancy. They observed no modification in the basal cardiac frequency, very few declarations and above all, never any signs of a flat or sinusoidal rhythm. Flattening of the FCR is invariably pathological. It must not be interpreted as 'fetal sleep' period, but it should intensify the surveillance.

N2  - Intra-uterine fetal movements indicate the wellbeing of the fetus and can be used in the detection of chronic fetal asphyxia. The daily variations in fetal activity follow an irregular pattern, though showing a peak of activity in the evening. The pattern of nocturnal activity is not known. In this study, fetal movements were monitored by maternal subjective recordings in 116 women with a normal pregnancy. In gestational weeks 31-40, fetal movements were recorded intermittently for at least 3 hours, both in the daytime and at night. In the daytime, fetal activity was moderate. A maximum occurred in the evening between 9 and 10 p.m. At night there was a period of minimum activity between 1 and 5 a.m. A minor peak in fetal activity was seen between 7 and 8 a.m. The frequency of fetal movements followed a pattern of a circadian rhythm, which was influenced by exogenous factors.

N2  - Circadian rhythms and hormonal interactions among the maternal, fetal and amniotic fluid compartments were studied in long-term catheterized rhesus macaque monkeys between days 127 and 138 of gestation (term = 167 days). Blood samples were collected at 3-hour intervals for 48 hours and analyzed by radioimmunoassay for estrone, estradiol, cortisol, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and prolactin. Distinct circadian rhythms were present for cortisol and progesterone in the maternal circulation and for progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in the fetal circulation (p < 0.05). Although maternal and fetal estrogen levels were higher in AM samples than in PM samples, a statistically significant circadian rhythm was not present (P > 0.10). Fetal levels of progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and maternal levels of progesterone were highest between 9:00 PM and 3:00 AM and lowest between 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM. Maternal levels of cortisol were highest between 6:00 AM and 9:00 AM and lowest between 6:00 PM and 12 midnight. The circadian patterns of maternal cortisol and progesterone were inversely related to each other (r = -0.68; p < 0.01). Amniotic fluid cortisol levels were highest between 9:00 AM and 12 noon and lowest between 6:00 PM and 3:00 AM (p < 0.10). With the possible exception of cortisol, amniotic fluid steroid hormones did not demonstrate distinct diurnal fluctuations, nor did they correlate with steroid changes in maternal or fetal blood. Because the rhesus placenta is permeable to glucocorticoids it is likely that transplacental passage of maternal cortisol influences the activity of the fetal pituitary and adrenal so that the circadian rhythm in the fetal axis is 180 degrees out of phase with that of the maternal axis. The circadian rhythms in fetal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and progesterone in late gestation parallel the biorhythm in uterine contraction frequency and amplitude, with peaks during periods of darkness between 9:00 PM and 3:00 AM.

N2  - The authors report on results of examinations of 18 women between the 38th and 42nd weeks of pregnancy in respect of the observation of foetal sleep/waking cycles. The following parameters were noted simultaneously, i.e. with time synchronicity: foetal heart rate, foetal eye movements, foetal thorax movements, and movements of the body and extremities. On the basis of the criteria published by Prechtl (1974) and by Nijhuis et al. (1982) it is possible to define with relative accuracy foetal sleep/waking cycles just before the term of birth; 4 independent researchers achieved agreement in the allocation of the various cycles in 86% of the cases investigated by them. In view of the fact that monitoring is complicated and exacting, recording cannot be continuous all the time and certain dropout periods must be taken into account. This applies, for example, to the foetal heart rate, foetal eye movements and movements of the thorax. The average dropout time during recording of foetal heart rate is 16%, during recording of foetal eye movements 22%, and of foetal thorax movements 3%. 11% of the recordings could not be evaluated because of poor recording quality and faulty monitoring. In the study under reference the shortest period of a cycle was three minutes, whereas the longest phase recorded so far was 39 minutes. In 55% of all monitored pregnancies between the 38th and 42nd weeks of pregnancy the foetus was awake, whereas in 45% the foetus was found to be asleep.

N2  - We studied the occurrence of ≥ 2 sec. respiratory pauses (RP) in very low risk, normal prematurely born infants (≤ 36 wks. of gestation), recorded when they reached 37-40 wks. conceptional age and compared the results with those of fullterm (37-41 wks. of gestation) newborns. The influence of gestational age at birth (GA), postnatal age, sleep states, twin birth and gross body movements was tested. We recorded 2434 central RP and only one 4 sec. duration obstructive RP. We never observed RP > 15 sec. 10-15 sec. RP were rare, noted only in 37-38 wks. GA newborns. We found some differences between prematures reaching normal term on the one hand and full-term newborns on the other: a) RP frequency and periodic breathing were higher in prematurely born infants; b) between-sleep state differences leveled out in prematures reaching normal term (they had more numerous RP in all sleep states), while the prevalence of RP in active sleep compared to quiet sleep was constant in full-term newborns. There were no significant differences between prematurely born twins and singletons. When they reached normal term, infants born before 35 wks. of gestation had more RP, compared to infants born at 35-36 wks. of gestation. About 12% of RP occurred after gross body movements.

N2  - Reduction of cortical inhibition has been suggested as a possible mechanism for the transition from episodic fetal to continuous postnatal breathing. Twelve fetal lambs were chronically decorticated at 112-115 days gestation. Lateral rectus, neck, and diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG), electrocorticogram (ECoG), and tracheal and arterial blood pressure were monitored after allowing 3 days for recovery. The fetal lambs were studied for 4-28 days in 2- to 4-h sessions/day. There were no episodes of low-voltage high-frequency ECoG activity. The mean duration (±SD) of rapid eye movements (REM) measured by lateral rectus EMG [11 ± 7.9 min and periods of tonic activity or silence [non-REM (NREM)], 14 ± 7.4 min] in decorticated fetuses were not statistically different from REM (12 ± 5.1 min) and NREM (15 ± 6.8 min) sleep periods in intact fetuses. After decortication, the percentage of time (±SD) occupied by different states were phasic diaphragmatic EMG activity 36 ± 7.8%, tonic diaphragmatic EMG 21 ± 8.6%, and diaphragmatic silence 43 ± 14.2%. Phasic diaphragmatic EMG activity occurred together with REM, the latter being present 45 ± 3.7% of the time. Despite decortication, between 115 and 125 days gestation ECoG changed from a trace alternans to a high-voltage low-frequency pattern. We conclude that the cerebral cortex is not responsible for apnea during fetal life. In addition, these data suggest that the cerebral cortex may normally be the source of ECoG synchrony.

N2  - Three experiments were conducted to determine whether housing in tether stalls, gestation stalls or individual pens imposes a stress upon gilts and sows. Changes in serum cortisol concentrations were used as the indicator for stress. In the first experiment, gilts were placed in tether stalls and individual pens to determine cortisol concentrations after tethering and to see if this response was different from gilts that were previously tethered for two weeks. In the second experiment, gilts were tethered in order to determine if penning in tether stalls altered the circadian rhythm of cortisol. In the third experiment, breeding sows were placed in tether stalls, gestation stalls or individual pens to determine if a ten-hour profile of cortisol concentrations were altered and if such housing affected a sow's response to transfer to farrowing crates. The results indicate that the initial response to tethering varied among gilts and sows and this variation appeared to be due to previous penning and human handling experiences. When tethering was stressful, acclimation required up to four days. However, once acclimated, tethering resulted in higher morning concentrations which may be associated with the greater activity that occurs at this time. Housing in tether stalls, gestation stalls or individual pens was not a stress for breeding sows and did not alter sows' responses to transfer into the farrowing crate.

N2  - Suspicion of alcohol's teratogenic potential stretches back many centuries, but it is only recently that solid support for this possibility has been produced. There is now little doubt that alcohol can produce developmental defects, but there are many questions that still remain to be answered concerning the impact of alcohol on the conceptus. One major question that remains to be resolved is why only a small percentage of alcoholic women give birth to children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), whereas other alcoholic women who drink the same amount do not. Another important issue concerns the way in which alcohol produces its effects. Although one of the most likely ways in which alcohol's teratogenic actions are mediated appears to be via hypoxia, other mechanisms such as direct toxicity of alcohol or acetaldehyde may be involved. FAS refers to a pattern of defects in children born to alcoholic women. For a diagnosis of FAS to be made, the patient must have three main characteristics: (1) pre- and postnatal growth retardation (≥2 S.D. for length and weight), (2) facial anomalies, and (3) central nervous system dysfunction. Pre- and postnatal growth retardation are the most reliable consequences of fetal alcohol exposure. In many cases, patients with the syndrome weigh less than 2500 g at birth and most do not exhibit postnatal 'catch-up growth'. Among the distinctive facial anomalies seen in conjunction with the syndrome are absent-to-indistinct philtrum, epicanthic folds, thin upper lip and short upturned nose. Joint, limb and cardiac anomalies are also often present. Central nervous system dysfunction includes mental retardation, the most serious consequence of in utero alcohol exposure, hyperactivity, sleep disorders and miscellaneous behavioral difficulties. If ony one or two of these broad characteristics are present and the mother is suspected of drinking during pregnancy, then a diagnosis of 'possible fetal alcohol syndrome', or 'partial fetal alcohol syndrome', or 'fetal alcohol effects', or 'alcohol-related birth defects' may be made. However, without evidence of maternal drinking during pregnancy, this diagnosis is very tentative, since many of these effects are also observed in conjunction with many other congenital disorders. On the basis of considerable evidence, it appears that prenatal alcohol exposure can result in a broader spectrum of effects ranging from spontaneous abortion and fetal alcohol syndrome at one end, and barely perceptible fetal alcohol effects at the other. This wide variability may be due to differences in exposure e.g., number of drinks consumed per drinking period, time of exposure during pregnancy, genetic sensitivity, nutritional status and possible interaction with other drugs. This review presents a broad overview of this topic.

N2  - Pineal N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in 10-day-old rat pups was used to examine several aspects of the developing circadian timing system. When born and reared under constant darkness, 10-day-old animals manifested a clear daily rhythm of NAT activity whose phase was in time with the estimated circadian time of the mother (set by the lighting cycle during pregnancy). When pups were reared in constant darkness from birth by a foster mother whose circadian time was 180° (12 h) out of phase with that of the natural mother, the resulting population profiles of NAT activity were arrhythmic. Analysis of the individual litter profiles from this experiment showed a variable postnatal influence of the maternal circadian system on the timing of the developing circadian system. Neither cross-fostering per se nor social interactions among litter mates contributed significantly to the apparent maternal influence. The magnitude of the postnatal maternal influence was not the same throughout development, but was most apparent during the first 5 days of life. Neonatal blinding (within 24 h of birth) did not appreciably alter the maternal influence. Extraretinal photoreception does not contribute to entrainment of the circadian clock during postnatal development, and retina-mediated photic entrainment is present by 10 days of age. The results indicate that pineal NAT activity monitored in 10-day-old rats provides a useful paradigm for studying the developing circadian system.

N2  - Newborn infants of mothers who drink heavily (>2 oz alcohol per day) during pregnancy have been shown to have hypersynchrony of the EEG. The possibility that hypersynchrony is related to acute alcohol withdrawal was tested. Eleven preterm infants of mothers who drank heavily ('alcoholic') were studied at a postnatal age of 4 to 6 weeks using power spectral analysis of EEG signals. This group was compared with a control group with similar racial and socioeconomic status. In addition, a group of ten 'healthy' preterm infants was compared with a carefully matched control group. Total power of the EEG during quiet, indeterminate and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was 162%, 183%, and 188%, respectively, in the infants whose mothers were alcoholic when compared with their control infants or with the healthy preterm infants and their control infants. It is concluded that ingestion of alcohol during pregnancy may result in potentially serious prolonged effects on brain function of the offspring, even in the absence of dysmorphology.

N2  - Using only skin surface blood gas measurements, we calculated the ventilatory response to inhaled carbon dioxide from changes in skin surface PCO2 (PsCO2). This new method is based on the fact that if CO2 elimination is nearly constant, the change in alveolar ventilation from one steady state level to another is inversely proportional to the change in PSCO2. From this we derived a ventilatory ratio (VR) for 0%, 2%, and 4% CO2 breathing. A ventilatory response slope is then calculated from the three VR values, and is similar to a standard CO2 response slope. We serially studied 20 infants (28 to 40 weeks gestation) 2 to 9 weeks of age. Ten infants had serious apnea, ten did not. The infants breathed each test gas for 8 to 10 minutes during quiet sleep with skin surface electrodes attached. Infants with apnea were studied before and after apneic spells resolved. We found that apneic infants had a significantly reduced VR slope compared with that in the nonapneic infants, regardless of age. When apnea disappeared, the ventilatory ratio slope always increased into the range measured in nonapneic infants. In nonapneic infants the ventilatory ratio slope significantly increased with postnatal age. We conclude that infants with serious apnea have a reduced ventilatory response to CO2 and that the resolution of apnea is associated with the development of a normal CO2 response.

N2  - Prospective data on 86 pregnant women were analysed to investigate the relationship between the pregnancy symptoms of nausea and vomiting and various demographic, social and psychological factors. In contrast to previous research findings no significant differences were discovered along demographic or social dimensions between women reporting no nausea, mild nausea and severe nausea during the first trimester of pregnancy. Not surprisingly, those women experiencing severe nausea reported significantly more sleep disturbances, fatigue and irritability. Women having both nausea and vomiting during the first trimester, reported significantly more unplanned, undesired pregnancies and negative relationships with their own mothers, than first trimester groups experiencing nausea only or no symptoms. Finally, those with continuing nausea and vomiting in the third trimester, when compared with those having no symptoms, tended to have reported significantly more psychological/psychiatric problems in the first trimester and were significantly more negative in their assessment of their own maternal relationship.

N2  - Breathing movements in the sleep fetus have been observed from a gestational age of about 40 days. From 95 to 115 days fetal breathing movements are almost continuous, interrupted by apnoea rarely exceeding 2 min. From 115 days until term (about 147 days) breathing and movements of the trunk and limbs are episodic. Breathing normally occurs only during rapid-eye-movement sleep as identified by low-voltage cortical electrical activity. Active movements of the neck muscles occur predominantly in high-voltage electrocortical activity. Hypercapnia or acid cerebrospinal fluid perfusion cause an increase in the regularity and depth of breathing when present, and recruit intercostal and laryngeal abductor activity. Isocapnic hypoxia, however, in contrast to the hyperventilation seen postnatally, causes arrest of fetal breathing movements. This effect is due to a central inhibition. Section of the brain stem, from the caudal hypothalamus rostrally, causes dissociation of fetal breathing movements and electrocortical activity into independent rhythms. Section of the brain stem caudally, in the upper pons or at the inferior colliculus, also causes a dissociation of electrocortical activity from breathing movements, which become almost continuous. Isocapnic hypoxia causes an increase in the rate and depth of breathing movements. It is concluded that the arrest of breathing in intact fetal lambs is not due to a direct effect on the respiratory centre in the medulla. The lumbar polysynaptic flexor reflex response becomes episodic after 115 days gestation but, in contrast to fetal breathing movements, is enhanced during high-voltage electrocortical activity. Isocapnic hypoxia arrests movements of the fetal limbs and trunk and inhibits the lumbar flexor reflex. This inhibition of the reflex is prevented by section of the spinal cord at T12, but persists after section of the brain stem in the upper pons. It is attributed to an action on the medulla, independent of the systemic arterial chemoreceptors. Small doses of pentobarbitone (5 mg/kg) cause arrest of fetal breathing movements by a suprapontine mechanism, abolished by brain stem transection, and inhibition of the lumbar flexor reflex by an action on the spinal cord, persisting after transection at T12. Inhibitors of prostaglandin synthetase (indomethacin, meclofenamate or aspirin) induce continuous fetal breathing movements, while prostaglandin E2 arrests fetal breathing. The site of action is on the medulla, as shown by section of the brain stem and of afferents from the systemic arterial chemoreceptors. The carotid bodies are functional before birth, though in the fetus their normal post-natal effects are diminished or absent, through central inhibition. There is also evidence that the central control of fetal breathing affects lung development. Section or paralysis of the phrenic nerves and space-occupying lesions of the thorax lead to pulmonary hypoplasia.

N2  - Changes in EEG and susceptibility to electrically induced seizures were examined in the ferret with lissencephaly produced by exposure to a single injection of methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM Ac) given to the pregnant jill on gestation day 32. Ten lissencephalic and 11 normal ferrets were chronically implanted with 14 cortical stainless steel electrodes. EEG records were sampled from various stages of the sleep/awake cycle. Six of each group were subjected to electrical stimulation for seizure threshold. Although the number of stimulations and the current intensity required to produce epileptiform afterdischarges (AD) and seizures were not different between the two groups, the lissencephalic ferrets had significantly longer AD and seizures, and a greater number of generalized seizures, indicating an enhanced seizure susceptibility. The EEG of the lissencephalic ferrets was characterized by increased slow wave activity within the low theta band range, extreme spindle activity, focal or multifocal slow and sharp waves, spikes, or spike and slow wave complexes. The differences in the EEG were more pronounced during drowsiness and sleep stages. The brains of all the treated animals were lissencephalic and hydrocephalic, and weighed significantly less than those of the normals. The cerebral cortex was thin and flattened, with the parieto-occipital region most severely affected. Heterotopic foci were found in the cerebellum as well as in the cerebral cortex. Abnormalities in the configuration of the cerebellar folia were also seen. Comparison between the electrophysiological and neuropathological data suggests that the extent of the extreme spindle activity, and longer AD and seizure duration depended on the degree of cerebellar dysplasia, whereas the EEG focal abnormalities were related to lesions in the cerebral hemispheres.

N2  - General pharmacological activities of 450191-S were studied in various species of animals and compared with those of reference benzodiazepines (BDZ). 450191-S at doses of 10 mg/kg slightly decreased (-5° C) the rectal temperature of rabbits. 450191-S decreased respiratory and heart rates in anesthetized cats, but the effects wee less than those of diazepam or triazolam. 450191-S increased respiratory and heart rates in conscious dogs, but had no effect on the blood pressure, electrocardiogram and autonomic nervous system in cats and dogs. The drug displayed a slight spasmolytic activity in the small intestine of guinea pigs and a slight inhibitory effect on isolated non-pregnant and pregnant uteri of rats. These effects were less than those of diazepam or nitrazepam. Below doses of 25 mg/kg, 450191-S did not affect urinary volume and electrolyte excretions in rats. It also decreased brain norepinephrine (NE) turnover rates in rats, but decreased NE and dopamine turnover rates in mice. These effects of 450191-S were less than those of nitrazepam. 450191-S was found to be minimally irritating to the ocular mucosa in rabbits and did not irritate the stomach and small intestine in rats. These effects were also compared with those of active metabolites of 450191-S, M-1, M-2, M-A, M-3 and M-4, and the superiority of the mother compound over its metabolites was clarified.

N2  - Delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP)-like material was detected in human breast milk of 2 women by RIA with a recovery of about 90%. The high concentration of DSIP-like immunoreactivity (DSIP-LI) in colostrum (30 ng/ml) decreased to about 10 ng/ml in milk. The concentration continued to decrease over the next 2 months in one woman. In the same woman, a significant circadian rhythm of the amount of breast milk DSIP was found with the peak in the afternoon and the trough in the morning. A significant effect of the sampling procedure was detected in the other woman examined; lower amounts of DSIP-LI were found when the milk was collected before and higher concentrations after nursing. Gel chromatography revealed that most of the immunoreactive DSIP-LI in milk and colostrum occurred in a form larger than the nonapeptide. The presence of DSIP itself, however, was demonstrated by high pressure liquid chromatography, which also showed additional peptides reacting with the antibody. Digestion of the large immunoreactive DSIP-LI by trypsin produced a peak on Sephadex G-10 that coeluted with DSIP. This peak contained three immunoreactive fractions with retention times on high pressure liquid chromatography similar to DSIP, phosphorylated DSIP, and N-tyrosine-DSIP. Plasma samples taken during pregnancy were assayed for DSIP but no difference from normal values was found. Slightly higher amounts were found in placenta than in blood, which might be due to interfering substances. No Tyr-MIF-1 or corticotropin-releasing hormone was detected by RIA in human breast milk. Peptides and proteins of milk can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of babies, but it is not known if the DSIP-LI in human milk is involved in the induction of a sleep-wake cycle in neonates.

N2  - RU 486 is a synthetic steroid hormone antagonist which acts at the receptor level. It has both intrinsic antiprogesterone and antiglucocorticosteroid properties in animals. We investigated the antiglucocorticosteroid activity in humans by evaluating the pituitary-adrenal response to RU 486 in men and in pregnant and nonpregnant women. In nonpregnant women, RU 486 (~1 mg/kg of body weight per day) produced an interruption of the luteal phase without affecting the pituitary-adrenal axis, thereby indicating a more potent antiprogesterone than antiglucocorticosteroid effect. In the course of pregnancy interruption by RU 486 (~4 mg/kg per day), there was a significant increase in plasma corticotropin, β-lipotropin, and cortisol concentrations. In normal men, RU 486 administration led to a dose-dependent stimulation of plasma corticotropin, β-endorphin, and cortisol. This disinhibition of the pituitary-adrenal axis was only observed during the morning hours of the circadian rhythm. When administered concomitantly with 1 mg of dexamethasone at midnight, 6 mg of RU 486 per kg completely suppressed the dexamethasone inhibitory effect on the pituitary-adrenal axis. These results indicate that RU 486 is an antiglucocorticosteroid that disrupts the negative pituitary feedback of both the morning cortisol rise and administered dexamethasone. Furthermore, they demonstrate the possibility of optimizing the antiprogestational effect of the compound and its potential use for human fertility control by modifying the dose and the time of administration of the drug and thereby minimizing the antiglucocorticosteroid effect.

N2  - Advances have recently been made in understanding the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. To correlate the new knowledge of theophylline pharmacokinetics with the drug's current status in therapy, we have critically reviewed the relevant investigations of the last 5 years. We consider data on its presumed mechanisms of action, factors affecting its clearance, its use in pregnancy, treatment of overdoses, and important drug interactions. Theophylline clearance is decreased by concomitant use of erythromycin, cimetidine, high-dose allopurinol, oral contraceptives, and caffeine. Clearance is increased by concomitant use of phenobarbital and phenytoin. Newly discovered actions of theophylline include dose-dependent improvement of diaphragmatic contractility, augmentation of ventilatory response to hypoxia, and sleep distubances (especially with high-dose treatments). Points clinically relevant to the daily use of theophylline derivatives and the importance of sustained-release preparations are discussed. Theophylline continues to play a major role in therapy for reactive airways disease.

N2  - An animal model was used to examine the effect of maternal alcohol administration on behaviors in the offspring which might predispose to alcoholism. Pregnant C3H mice were administered a liquid diet containing 28% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) from gestation-day 8 until parturition. Control animals were either pair-fed an isocaloric 0% EDC diet or received standard lab chow and water throughout pregnancy. Offspring were tested for sleep time following a challenge dose of 3.5 or 4.5 g/kg ethanol at 25 or 110 days of age or for consumption of 10% w/v ethanol in a two-bottle choice situation. The results demonstrated that prenatal exposure to alcohol did not affect alcohol-induced sleep time at either testing age or dose and that waking blood alcohol levels were similar across groups. Voluntary alcohol consumption, however, was higher in mice exposed to alcohol in utero during the initial week of testing but intake decreased to near control levels by the third week. Whether other alcohol-related behaviors are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure remains to be examined.

N2  - We examined the entraining effect of the maternal circadian system on the fetal circadian oscillation during pregnancy. The circadian rhythm of locomotor activity and plasma corticosterone of pregnant rats was abolished by bilateral ablation of the suprachiasmatic nuclei at day 10 of gestation. At term, pups were removed by Cesarean section and were blinded immediately. To avoid possible rhythmic influences of a nursing mother on the pups' circadian rhythms, alternating nursing was imposed on blinded infants. Thus, pups were exchanged every 12 h between two foster mothers, one entrained to a light-dark cycle and the other to dark-light, so that one group of pups were always nursed in the light period and the other in the dark. Both groups of pups showed free-running circadian hormone rhythms with similar phase angles. However, the circadian rhythm of these pups was always phase delayed by about 8 h to that of blinded control pups which were born to unoperated mothers. Furthermore, blinded pups born to and nursed by a suprachiasmatic nuclei lesioned mother developed a circadian hormone rhythm which was phase delayed by 4 h to that of the control. It is concluded that the circadian oscillation underlying the rhythm of corticosterone release in rats has entrained to the maternal circadian system during fetal life. It is further suggested that the entrainment starts before day 10 of gestation.

N2  - We studied locally anesthetized lamb fetuses (140-144 days' gestation) in utero on the day of surgical preparation (the acute preparation) to correlate sleep/wake (S/W) states with fetal breathing movements (FBM) activated by CO2 with and without endorphin displacement by naloxone. We placed electrodes for definition of S/W states, a carotid arterial catheter for injections and measurements of pressure, pHa, Pa(CO2), and Pa(O2), and intratracheal and intraesophageal catheters for measurement of FBM and esophageal motility. We recorded the onset, pattern and cessation of breathing and estimated fetal respiratory responsivity to CO2 rebreathing by the ewe using our fetal CO2 test (Moss, I.R. and Scarpelli, E.M., 1979, J. Appl. Physiol. 47: 527-531). Activation of breathing by CO2 either accompanied or followed wakefulness (W). FBM and W were sustained throughout CO2 stimulation. Cessation of breathing after the CO2 test was temporally associated with the resumption of sleep. When the test was started in active sleep (AS) and W, breathing threshold to CO2 was lower than when it was started in quiet sleep (QS). Naloxone treatment (1) resulted in activation of FBM in association with W, (2) lowered CO2 threshold as compared to that of CO2 tests entered in QS without naloxone, and (3) caused greater FBM responses to CO2 than without naloxone. These results extend previous reports from our laboratory in that they demonstrate the importance of W to normal respiratory responsivity to CO2 in the acute fetal preparation and the possible role of endorphins in respiratory control.

N2  - We wished to investigate mechanisms by which non-labour contractions of the uterus influence fetal sleep states and respiratory activity during late pregnancy. The relationship between the dimensions of the fetal chest and uterine contractions was examined in 5 pregnant sheep. The dorso-ventral dimension at the level of the xiphisternum (3 fetuses) decreased, on average by 4.4-9.4% while increases of 16.6-18.7% were seen in the transverse dimension (4 fetuses). Blood flow in a middle uterine artery was monitored using a Doppler technique in 5 pregnant sheep. Non-labour uterine contractions were accompanied by mean reductions of 6.5-12.7% in blood flow. Postural adjustments by the ewe also influenced uterine blood flow. A mean increase in blood flow of 5.9-12.0% followed a change from standing to lying; standing caused a mean reduction of 5.9-11.8%. We conclude that the influence of uterine contractions on the fetus is likely to be complex, involving distortion of the body and alterations in utero-placental haemodynamics.

N2  - The experiments were designed to examine (1) the effects of acute hypoxia and (2) the influence of sleep states on the electrical activity of the cerebellum in the fetus. Five fetal sheep were instrumented between 106 and 133 days of gestation and survived in utero until term (140-146 days). Insulated stainless steel electrodes (75 μm diam.) were introduced into the cerebellar cortex and cemented in place. Electrodes were also implanted into 4 fetuses to monitor the electrocorticogram, rapid eye movements and the EMG of the dorsal neck (nuchal) muscles. Recordings of cerebellar activity were made for 252 h in 4 fetuses. The recordings were derived from many units (probably Purkinje cells) with a high level of basal discharge. The mean firing frequency was related to fetal sleep state. The highest frequencies coincided with episodes of rapid eye movements with low-voltage electrocortical activity and the lowest occurred during high-voltage electrocortical activity when rapid eye movements are absent. Acute hypoxaemia (fetal p(a)O2 6-10 mm Hg for up to 30 min) abolished rapid eye movements and caused a marked reduction in cerebellar activity. High-voltage electrocortical activity and nuchal EMG activity were maintained indicating that the effects of hypoxia on the the cerebellum were not due simply to a general CNS depression. Cerebellar neural activity returned to normal at the termination of the hypoxic stimuli demonstrating that fetal Purkinje cells can withstand short episodes of severe hypoxia.

N2  - The influence of maternal circadian rhythms on fetal circadian oscillations during pregnancy was examined. Circadian rhythms of spontaneous locomotor activity and plasma corticosterone level in pregnant rats were eliminated by bilateral lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) at different stages of gestation and the postnatal manifestation of the circadian corticosterone rhythm was examined in individual pups. Effective lesions of SCN at day 3 of gestation resulted in an abortion in all rats examined. Rats whose SCN were lesioned at day 10 or 17 of gestation maintained their pregnancies. At term, pups were removed by Cesarean operation and immediately blinded by bilateral ocular enucleation; they were reared by unoperated foster mother afterwards. All pups from SCN lesioned mothers showed a clear free running circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone levels after the 4th week of postnatal life. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm that developed in pups from SCN-lesioned mother at day 10 of gestation (G10 pups) was always phase-delayed about 4 h as compared with that in pups from mothers whose SCN were lesioned at day 17 of gestation (G17 pups) and in pups from sham-operated mothers (S pups). It is concluded that the circadian hormone rhythmicity develops in normal fashion postnatally when the maternal SCN are effectively lesioned after day 10 of gestation. The phase-angle difference in the circadian rhythm between G10 pups and G17 or S pups suggests that fetal circadian oscillation is entrainable at least after day 10 of gestation.

N2  - A 5-year-old boy with nemaline myopathy was reported. He was admitted to our hospital because of severe respiratory and cardiac failure. He could not be weaned from a respirator. He was born after 42 weeks gestation, weighed 3,400 g and was mildly asphyxiated. His parents were unrelated and there was no family history of neuromuscular disorders. Since birth he was hypotonic and developmental milestones were delayed. He walked at 1 year. He got up with Gowers' maneuver. Five months before admission, he entered a kindergarten where he had to practice marching every day. Five days prior to admission, his face became pale. On the day before admission, marked edema of the eyelids and the legs appeared. Next morning he became lethargic with generalized cyanosis and respiratory difficulty, and was referred to our hospital. Physical examination revealed a moderate and slender boy with a high arched palate and mild scoliosis. The lungs were clear but galloping rhythms were audible. Liver and spleen were not palpable and tendon jerks were negative. The chest X-ray film showed cardiomegaly (CTR 63%) and EKG showed RVH. PaCO2 was 83 Torr, ESR was 0.5 mm/hr but serum levels of GOT, GPT, LDH, AL-P and CPK were normal. Diaphragm movement was markedly diminished at X-ray examination. The rectus femoris muscle was biopsied and a moderate variation in muscle fiber size was observed on HE staining. Modified Gomori-Trichrome staining showed many muscle fibers containing nemaline rods. Type 1 fibers were markedly small in caliber on NADH staining and routine ATPase reaction. Serum carnitine level was normal. He had been hospitalized for 18 months because he required mechanical ventilation during sleep. blu

N2  - Three unusual cases of posterior interosseous nerve palsy involving an entrapment mechanism are described. The findings in these three cases seem to support the view that PIN entrapment usually results from interaction of exogenous factors (occupation, pregnancy, compression during sleep, etc.) with anatomical anomalies at the level of the supinator brevis muscle.

N2  - Breastfeeding reduces the interval between births by its effect on prolonging the period of postpartum anovulation and in some cases, reducing the likelihood of conception once ovulation has occurred. Extended durations of postpartum amenorrhea (18 months and longer) are observed among many women in developing countries, while shorter durations (6 months or less) are common among women in developed countries. This differential effect has been suggested to be related to maternal nutritional status, but numerous other factors also differ. This paper reviews the literature in this area, and suggests that most studies indicate a small and demographically insignificant effect of maternal nutritional status on the period of postpartum amenorrhea. Factors associated with suckling patterns appear to be more important in determining the length of postpartum infertility. Suckling frequency and intensity which affects the hormonal stimulus preventing ovulation appear to be affected by the type of and how supplemental feeding is given to the child (use of bottles), whether suckling is on demand or scheduled, the frequency of night-time feedings (influenced by whether or not the mother sleeps with the child), whether or not pacifiers are used, and the child's nutritional and health status.

N2  - The effects of cooling have been studied in chronically instrumented unanaesthetized fetal lambs of 106-132 days gestation. Cold stimulation of cutaneous thermoreceptors by means of a coil placed around the fetus in the amniotic cavity induced continuous breathing which was associated with high-voltage electrocortical activity throughout the cooling period. Direct internal cooling by means of an intragastric cooling coil did not alter fetal breathing or sleep-state patterns. Shivering occurred in response to both external and internal cooling, and this response was present as early as 106 days gestation, well before the appearance of high-voltage sleep. In older fetuses there was evidence of a reduction in thermoregulatory responses during low-voltage electrocortical activity, but not of the complete suspension of thermoregulation characteristic of low-voltage (r.e.m.) sleep seen in mature animals. It is concluded that deep regular breathing associated with high-voltage electrocortical activity can be induced by cold stimulation of cutaneous thermoreceptors, but not by a reduction in core temperature alone. Furthermore, fetal responses to cooling are present as early as 106 days gestation.

N2  - The effects of methadone and morphine on fetal behavior were studied following their administration to either the mother (5 μg/kg/min) or fetus (0.5 μg/kg maternal wt/min) using the chronically-instrumented pregnant ewe model. Fourteen unanesthetized, unrestrained pregnant ewes between 130-141 days gestation (term 145 days) were studied 9-28 days following the surgical implantation of cannulae and electrodes to monitor fetal heart rate, blood pressure, breathing movements, eye movements, muscular and electrocortical activity. The three behavioral states of quiet sleep, rapid eye movement sleep and arousal could be distinguished using these parameters. Both drugs, by both routes, resulted in fetal arousal, largely at the expense of quiet sleep. While morphine and methadone were equipotent in suppressing quiet sleep following infusion to the fetus, methadone was three times more potent than morphine after maternal infusion. This potency difference is consistent with the results of prior pharmacokinetic studies demonstrating that fetal exposure to maternally administered methadone is approximately three times greater than that to maternally administered morphine.

N2  - Several authors have recommended that the fetus is mechanically stimulated if the abdominal pregnancy CTG shows no accelerations. One expects the fetus to show a motor response to mechanical stimulation. Fetal movements expressed as accelerations in the abdominal CTG are considered to reflect 'arousal' of the previously asleep fetus and are thought to be normal. An absence of such a response is considered by some as a sign of pathological fetal changes. Others, however, have found that the normal non-stressed fetus need not change its sleep-arousal state after mechanical stimulation. An attempt was made to clarify this in the present work. We studied the CTG recordings and the ultrasound pictures in 63 pregnancies in a total of 83 cases for an average of 56 minutes. Fetal movements were marked by pressing a lever on the labor pressure chart. The fetus was mechanically stimulated by shaking its head manually for 5 seconds. Control recordings were also made, when the fetus was not so stimulated. The following results were obtained: 1. With a normal CTG (reactive nonstress test, FISCHER score 8-10 points). Mechanical stimulation led to no changes in 87% of NREM sleep and in 93.9% of REM sleep. A change to a more active state (REM sleep + arousal) due to stimulation was found in 13% of NREM sleep, which is significantly more frequent than the 2.9% found when no stimulation occurred. A change from REM sleep to arousal was found in 6.1%, not significantly different from 1.8% found without stimulation. Short-lasting reactions to mechanical stimulation included movements, acceleration of fetal heart rate and dip 0. These reactions were equally frequent in REM and NREM sleep, i.e. 75% and 68.5% respectively. These reactions occurred by chance less frequently, in 14.5% of cases in REM and in 3% of cases on NREM sleep. The occurrence is significantly higher in REM than in NREM sleep. 2. In a pathological CTG (FISCHER score 7 points or less) our technique does not permit us to distinguish the different sleep-arousal states. Only the short-lasting response to mechanical stimulation of the fetus was hence evaluated. Mechanical stimulation resulted in a fetal response in 19% with decelerations of variable expression similar to the variable decelerations observed during labor. These decelerations occurred only together with other signs of fetal distress in the CTG. The rate of dip 0 occurrence following mechanical stimulation with pathological CTG present was significantly higher (22.5%) than when the CTG was normal (4.4-5.3%). The same percentage of cases with normal or pathological CTG showed no reaction at all, 28.6% for pathological and 25-31.5% for normal CTG. Conclusions 1. the absence of a fetal response to mechanical stimulation gives no information regarding the state of the fetus: 2. the occurrence of variable decelerations in response to mechanical stimulation of the fetus is a pathological sign. Hence the mechanical stimulation of the fetus in the non-reactive nonstress test may be of some value; 3. a change from a sleep phase into an arousal phase following mechanical stimulation of the fetus is only rarely attained.

N2  - The extent of variation in the serum myoglobin (Mb) levels of normal healthy females was investigated so that the value of Mb measurements for carrier detection could be properly assessed. Factors considered were sex, age, menstrual status, pregnancy, diurnal variation and daily activity. In each instance, Mb levels were compared with those for serum creatine kinase (CK). A significant difference (P < 0.001) was found between the Mb levels of men and women but no relationship could be found between several measurements of body build and the Mb or CK levels of either sex. An apparent correlation of Mb concentrations with age was found in control groups of both sexes up to 85 years of age, but this was not significant below 60 years of age. No differences in Mb levels were found among premenarchal, menstruating, postmenopausal or hysterectomised women and neither smoking nor the use of oral contraceptives seemed to affect Mb levels. Serum CK levels were very much higher in premenarchal (P < 0.001) and postmenarchal (P < 0.05) teenagers than in adult controls. No difference was found between the mean Mb levels of non-pregnant and pregnant (6-40 weeks) women. The mean value for CK activity was significantly lower than normal in the pregnant women (P < 0.001). a marked circadian rhythm of serum Mb levels was found with samples taken at 5 p.m. being approximately 20% lower than those taken at 9 a.m. This unexpected decrease during the day persisted with 48 hours of bedrest suggesting that this rhythm is inherent and unrelated to muscular activity.

N2  - Current trends and controversies in antiepileptic drug therapy are reviewed from a clinical point of view. The usefulness of prophylactic therapy of febrile seizures and posttraumatic seizures or posttraumatic epilepsy is compromised by difficulties in the management of the patients, especially by noncompliance. Previously untreated epilepsies can be treated successfully in 70-80% of the patients. Phenytoin or carbamazepine are equally effective for generalized tonic-clonic seizures or focal seizures, while absence seizures are controlled by ethosuximide or valproic acid. Only when the epilepsy is uncontrolled despite high plasma concentrations which cannot be raised because of side effects, should a second drug be given. A second drug is successful in about one out of six patients with focal epilepsy. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and primidone seem to be equally effective for these drug-resistant cases. Status epilepticus can be treated with intravenous diazepam or phenytoin and, if necessary, with an infusion of phenytoin. Rectal diazepam is useful for acute pediatric therapy. Drugs of second choice are clonazepam, phenobarbital, lidocaine, and clomethiazole. In the pregnant epileptic patient a drop in the plasma concentration of antiepileptic drugs mainly through non-compliance and seizure provocation through sleep deprivation are major sources of the deterioration of epilepsies during pregnancy. The 'fetal antiepileptic drug syndrome', malformation and an increased risk for epilepsy in the child are discussed as an interaction of parental epilepsy and drug-exposure during pregnancy. Finally, the interpretation of abnormal clinical chemistry data is reviewed. Disorder of the liver, bone, thyroid gland and blood are rarely seen in treated epileptic patients, usually when specific risk factors are present. The over-interpretation of laboratory abnormalities, e.g. an isolated increase of γ-GT, may lead to iatrogenic deterioration of epilepsy when the effective dose of the drug is reduced because of an unfounded fear of hepatic toxicity.

N2  - The human oculomotor system becomes active long before birth. At about 16 weeks (post-menstrual age) the first slow changes of eye position can be observed with the aid of real time ultrasonography. At 18-20 weeks more rapid eye movements are detectable. There is a gradual decline in the percentage of time spent in rapid and slow eye movements from 32-40 weeks. These eye movements are organized in episodes of activity, divided by episodes of quiescence which are at first unrelated to cyclical changes in other variables (such as breathing movements, body movements and fetal heart rate patterns). At about 36 weeks gestation, REM and non-REM episodes become linked with other changes and then represent behavioural states identical to those seen in the newborn infant. This organization of behavioral states in the fetus is identical with that found in preterm infants of comparable age. Opening of eyelids is difficult to see before birth but the existence of episodes of wakefulness seems most probable. Hence fetal eye movements will be in part related to wakefulness. In the newborn at term, the interval distributions of REMs during sleep and of scanning eye movements during wakefulness are statistically different.

N2  - To test the efficacy of temporally patterned kinesthetic and auditory stimulation for promoting development of infants born prior to term, 88 preterm infants, below 35 weeks gestation, were assigned to 1 of 4 experimental or control groups. Control subjects received regular hospital care; fixed interval subjects received 15 min of rocking/heartbeat stimulation each hour; self-activating subjects received 15 min rocking/heartbeat when inactive for 90 sec, but only for 1 stimulation period per hour. Assessments included measures of neurological functioning, sleep-wake activity, mother-infant interaction, and mental and motor development at 8 and 24 months. All experimental infants, compared to controls, showed decreased rates of activity while in the hospital, fewer abnormal reflexes, and better orienting responses. At 24 months, experimental infants scored significantly higher on the Mental Development Index of the Bayley Scales. Few differences were found in parent-infant interaction patterns. The results indicate that both temporal patterning and contingent responsiveness in the preterm infant's early environment contribute positively to some aspects of the development of such infants.

N2  - The effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency was monitored prospectively in 136 pregnancies of 122 epileptic women. Pregnancy did not influence the seizure frequency in 68 pregnancies (50%). In 50 pregnancies (37%) the number of seizures increased during pregnancy or puerperium. The seizure frequency decreased in 18 pregnancies (13%). In 34 out of 50 pregnancies 68%) the increase was associated with non-compliance with the drug regimen or sleep deprivation. In seven out of 18 pregnancies (39%) improvement was related to correction of non-compliance or sleep deprivation during the pregestational nine months. Insufficiently low plasma concentrations of antiepileptic drugs were found in 47% of the women with uncontrolled epilepsy during pregnancy. The course of epilepsy during pregnancy is primarily influenced by non-compliance, sleep deprivation during pregnancy, and inadequate therapy before and during pregnancy. With good medical attention pregnancy itself seems to have only a minimal influence on the course of epilepsy.

N2  - Continuous illumination (LL) beginning at 22 days of age caused precocious puberty followed by persistent estrus with anovulation in female offspring originating from mother rats exposed to a 14L:10D light-dark cycle prior to and during pregnancy. However, LL had no deleterious effect on reproductive cycles of offspring reared in LL and originating from mothers exposed to LL prior to and during pregnancy. These rats had a normal onset of puberty in LL, a normal 4-day estrous cycle, a periodic rise of plasma estrogen prior to the periodic appearance of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, and spontaneous ovulation in LL continued until at least 300 days of age. Also, the female offspring of these rats showed a similar resistance to the deleterious effects of LL on cyclic ovulation. These results support the following interpretation: 1) offspring from mother rats exposed to LL prior to and during pregnancy become insensitive to the deleterious effects of LL on cyclic ovulation, 2) neural elements controlling cyclic release of LH are not totally photoperiod (14L:10D)-dependent, and 3) in the absence of daily 14L:10D signals, an endogenous clock, possibly timed by daily laboratory signals (temperature, noise, taking of vaginal smears), may provide time cues for cyclic LH release.

N2  - In the foetus, as in the adult, the behavioural state of the central nervous system plays a very significant role in the modulation of respiratory activity. Breathing at birth represents the continuation of a process that commences early in life in utero and develops as gestation proceeds. The profile of classical afferent respiratory input to the foetus in utero is significantly different to that of the new born, with a reduction in total neural traffic and a smaller phasic variation. The foetus, however, phasically contracts its diaphragm which, as gestation proceeds, is patterned into distinct 'on and off' periods. Breathing of the foetus occurs during rapid eye movement sleep, analogous to that in the adult, and continues following somatic stimulation. This behavioural state is reduced during foetal hypoxia and foetal respiration is simultaneously depressed. At birth there is an increase in both somatosensory neural input and phasic variation and the new born breathes in all behavioural states, the stability of which varies cyclically with a period similar to that seen before birth. Whereas improved surgical and experimental techniques and non-invasive technology have enabled a more complete description of the development of the respiratory system in utero, the transitional events of the processes which occur at birth happen very quickly and at present prevent a similar detailed description.

N2  - Midazolam was given in a single 15-mg oral dose as a sedative the evening before elective cesarean section. Twelve hours later, levels of this new benzodiazepine were measurable in the fetomaternal entity in only one of 13 cases. After 15 mg midazolam orally or 0.05 mg/kg midazolam intramuscularly 15 to 60 min before elective cesarean section, there was evident transfer of drug into the placenta, but transfer took place more slowly than with diazepam. On the basis of kinetics derived from maternal serum concentrations after oral, intramuscular, or intravenous dosing midazolam appears to have a rapid onset and short duration of action, which was also evident from subjective assessments by the patients. There was wide interindividual variation in the gastrointestinal absorption of midazolam in full-term pregnant women. Clinically, midazolam nevertheless seemed to be very useful for nocturnal sedation before elective cesarean section; it ensures a mean duration of sleep of about 6 hr and there are virtually no detectable levels of drug in the fetomaternal entity the next morning.

N2  - According to recent investigations more than half of all growth disorders are due to growth hormone (GH) deficiency. I. The cause of the classic hypothalamo-pituitary dwarfism is; 1. perinatally acquired lesions of the hypothalamus; 2. suprasellar tumours; 3. brain malformations; 4. hereditary disturbances of GH-synthesis. -II. Constitutional delay of growth and adolescent development is clinically characterised by harmonious delay of growth, skeletal development and sexual maturation. The typical aspect of the pituitary dwarf is missing. Whereas provocation tests for GH do not show reliable deviations, assessment of the spontaneous GH secretion during sleep usually demonstrates a significant GH-deficit. III. Impairments of GH synthesis with production of a hormone which reacts in the RIA but exhibits reduced biological effectivity causes the same clinical picture as constitutional delay. The disorders I-III can successfully be treated by GH-IV. Familial short stature is based on the summation of hereditary anlages of the parents. In principle, it is no endocrine disorder. However, the combination with disorders II and III occurs frequently ('Small/Delay' acc. to Tanner). -V. Intrauterine growth retardation is caused by maternal, placental or fetal factors. With most of the 'small for dates' growth prognosis is good. However, if teratogenic agents, particularly alcohol is involved, and if the damage occurs in the first months of gestation, the prognosis is unfavorable. -VI. A great number of genetic disorders is connected with pre- and/or postnatal growth retardation, combined with typical malformations. Apart from few exceptions these syndroms are rare. Endocrine deviations are missing. -The therapeutic possibilities of GH and anabolics are thoroughly discussed.

N2  - In previous reports (J. Physiol. 325, 493, 507, 521, 1982) we have suggested a prenatal onset of the circadian oscillation in rats. This was based mainly on the findings obtained in pups which were reared by an alternating nursing. In the present study we have applied this technique to experiments which were designed to determine the stage of gestation in the original mother that decided the phase angle of pup's hormone rhythm which was to develop later in the postnatal life. In this experiment we observed, though preliminarily, that reversal of the light-dark cycle of the pregnant mother at day 10 of pregnancy resulted in an effective reversal of pup's hormone rhythm, whereas the reversal at day 17 of pregnancy failed to affect it. From these results it is surmised that the original mother primarily determined the phase angle of the circadian oscillation in the fetus prior to the 17th day of gestation.

N2  - The effect of pregnancy on the circadian rhythm and diurnal excursion of plasma cortisol and urinary free corticoids was examined in a sequential study during the second and third trimester and 6 to 12 weeks postpartum. Hourly blood samples from six subjects and 8-hour urine collections from eight subjects were obtained around the clock. While the circadian rhythm was maintained during gestation, plasma cortisol levels (24-hour mean, nadir, peak, and nadir-peak excursion) increased. The relative excursion of plasma cortisol (expressed as the percentage of deviation from the 24-hour mean) exhibited remarkable blunting compared with postpartum values. This pregnancy-associated blunting of plasma cortisol excursion was indicated by a significant reduction in the: (1) mean peak and nadir excursion, (2) integrated area between the percent deviation curve and the 24-hour mean, and (3) mean slope of the major incremental and decremental segments of the percent deviation curve. The circadian rhythm and diurnal excursion of plasma cortisol were reflected in urinary free corticoid values. Mean 24-hour urinary free corticoid concentrations increased 180% during gestation over nonpregnant levels. Nadir concentrations of urinary free corticoids in pregnancy exceeded peak nonpregnant levels. The gestational rise of metabolically active free cortisol and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and the pregnancy-associated blunting of the excursion of plasma cortisol may be explained by an autonomous source of ACTH during gestation.

N2  - One thousand consecutive postpartum patients were interviewed by questionnaire to establish the incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnancy. Hand symptoms had been noted by 34%: 25% had had symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, 2% symptoms of ulnar nerve compression and 7% ill defined hand symptoms. Maternal and fetal age, parity and weight change did not correlate with the presence of symptoms. The rate of ring removal because of swelling was twice as great for the symptomatic women (73%) as for the asymptomatic women (36%), and the rates of pre-eclampsia, hypertension and edema were higher for the women with symptoms. Three quarters of the women had bilateral symptoms, and half of the multigravidas had had similar symptoms in previous pregnancies. Hand function and sleep were disturbed in 75% of the symptomatic women, yet only 46% of all those with symptoms mentioned their symptoms to their doctors; treatment was given to only 16% (35% of those who complained), and relief was obtained by only half of these.

N2  - To assess the influence of sleep states, gestational age, and postnatal age on respiratory frequencies, we made polygraphic recordings on forty-eight 31-41 wk gestational age newborns (≤ 10 days of legal age) and on 16 prematurely born (≤ 36 wk of gestation) infants, after they reached the term of 37-40 wk conceptional age. Periods with and without ≥3-sec respiratory pauses were independently analyzed by 20-sec periods. States of sleep were defined according to REMs and EEG criteria. At all ages and in all sleep states, respiratory frequencies were slightly, but not significantly, lower in total tracing compared to no-pause tracing. Results of statistical comparison were identical when they were performed on both total and no-pause tracings. From 35 wk gestational age onward, respiratory frequency was higher in active (AS) REM sleep, compared to quiet (QS) NREM sleep (P < 0.01). In undefined sleep (IS), respiratory frequency was at an intermediate level (AS > IS > QS), significantly different from that of AS and QS. Respiratory frequentcy was similar in all 31-38 wk gestational age newborns. It became significantly higher in 39-41 wk gestational age newborns (P < 0.01). The frequency of the respiration was higher in prematurely born infants reaching 37-48 or 39-40 wk conceptional age, compared to that of newborns of the same gestational age. We did not find significant differences between genders in any age group studied. At all ages there was a high correlation among respiratory frequencies found in AS, QS, and IS and also among those frequencies found in successive sleep cycles for given individuals: some normal infants breathed more rapidly and the others more slowly in all states studied. It appears that respiratory frequency is an individual characteristic, modulated by the sleep state, gestational age and postnatal age factors. The review of the literature suggests, that divergences among authors can be due to some methodological differences and particularly to differences in scoring of sleep states.

N2  - The electrocorticograms (ECoGs) of the first generation (F1) hybrid mice of C57BL/6 x C3H irradiated at fetal or neonatal period were studied at 6-8 (young) and 24-26 (old) months of age. Two groups of mice were irradiated on the 17th day of gestation (17-DPC), another 2 groups on the day of birth (0-DPP), and third 2 groups on the 7th day after birth (7-DPP). All animals were irradiated with 300 R of X-rays to the whole body. The ECoGs were recorded form freely moving animals with permanently implanted electrodes fixed over the visual cortical surface. Recordings were continuous for 3 h, starting at 10:00 a.m. The ECoGs were divided into 3 patterns: wakefulness (W), slow wave sleep (SWS), and paradoxical sleep (PS). Six parameters of the 3 patterns were compared for the 6 irradiated and 2 non-irradiated groups at the young and old age. Non-X-irradiated: There was no difference in the proportion of the total SWS time to the total recording time (TRT) between the young and old control groups. The mean SWS cycle time and the mean SWS length were significantly longer in the young group than in the old group. The ratio of the total PS time to the total sleep time (TST) for the old group was significantly high as compared with that for the young group. The old group had significantly shorter mean PS cycle time and mean PS length than did the young group. X-irradiated: The proportion of total SWS time to TRT was significantly less in the old 0-DPP group than in the comparably aged control group. Mean SWS cycle time, and mean SWS and PS length for the 17-DPC and 0-DPP groups at young age were intermediate between those of the control group at young age and the control group at old age. The ratio of total PS time to TST for the 17-DPC and 0-DPP groups at both ages was significantly less than that for the control groups at every age level. Mean PS length of the 0-DPP group at old age was significantly short as compared with that of the control group at the same age. The body weight and brain weight of these 4 irradiated groups except body weight of the old 17-DPC group were lower than those of their control groups. There were little or no changes in the sleep-wakefulness cycle of the ECoGs for the 7-DPP group at both ages. These results may suggest that the adult and aged mouse X-irradiated at fetal or neonatal period show the ECoG pattern which occurs at a later age in their control groups, namely, an acceleration in the aging of the ECoG pattern.

N2  - Two clinically healthy pregnant women were studied in a single 24-h span during the third trimester. Blood drawn every 20 min was assayed for cortisol (F), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), estriol (E3), and prolactin (PRL). Blood drawn hourly was assayed for progesterone (P), human placental lactogen (HPL) and 15alpha-hydroxyestriol (E4). Breast temperature (BT) was continuously monitored. Single cosinor analysis demonstrated statistically significant circadian rhythms for plasma concentrations of F, DHEA-S, and BT for both subjects, and of E3 for one subject. Statistically significant circadian rhythms in plasma concentrations of P, HPL, E4 or PRL could not be demonstrated in our third trimester subjects. However, analysis of data from subjects sampled at earlier gestational ages revealed highly significant PRL circadian rhythms. These results suggest that plasma concentrations of PRL show a progressive decrease in circadian amplitude despite a progressive increase in mesor with advancing gestational age. Frequent sampling and cosinor data analysis permit identification of circadian rhythms in BT. The use of BT as a potential marker for rhythms in plasma concentration of certain hormones awaits further scrutiny. The demonstration of several circadian endocrine rhythms in individual subjects in the third trimester of human pregnancy facilitates the usefulness of such marker rhythms.

N2  - A literature review reports the results of investigations about fetal intrauterine activity. Different methods of observation are demonstrated and discussed. The results indicate that real-time-ultrasound is an accurate method for observation of fetal movements. Different patterns are identified: Fetal body and extremity movements. Development of fetal activity in early pregnancy is looked at as a process of maturition associated with fetal cerebral function. After 12 weeks of pregnancy typical patterns are established and seen also in the following weeks. Different results are reported about frequency of fetal movements related to duration of pregnancy. A circadian rhythm seems to be associated with a peak in activity between 2100 and 0100 hours, although fetal activity is altered by a variety of drugs and external stimuli. The proportion of pathological foetal movements in early pregnancy seems higher in patients who aborted. There are findings in later pregnancy, which report good fetal outcome, if daily fetal movement recording is greater than 10 movements for 12 hours. Fetal breathing movements are recognized as being normally present, but episodic, shallow and variable in rate and regularity. There is a great variability in the percentage of time fetuses spend making breathing movements (mean 30-50% per hour; range 0-80%). Under physiological conditions there is a circadian rhythm concomitant with changes in fetal low-voltage electrocortical activity. The activation of fetal breathing occurs mainly during rapid-eye-movement-sleep, but the physiologic control of the activation has not been identified. Apnea, frequency, variability and amplitude of breathing, continuous breathing or gasping are described, but positive identification of abnormal pattern is not achieved. Several factors affecting fetal breathing movements have been described, their physiologic significance and control and their clinical relevance remain to be clearly elucidated. Total fetal activity. Fetal biophysical variables such as tone, breathing, body and extremity movements and heart rate reactivity are initiated and regulated by the fetal central nervous system, and as such, the presence of a given variable is indirect evidence of a functioning and intact central nervous system. These variable could be depressed by hypoxemia or other factors. Data in literature suggest that combined fetal biophysical testing is a more accurate method of antepartum fetal evaluation than any single method.

N2  - A series of experiments were designed to examine the effects of diet and photoperiod upon the onset of sexual maturity in the ewe. In Experiment I, March-born ewe lambs (n=77) were reared from 9 to 28 weeks of age on two levels of dietary energy and three photoperiods consisting of ambient light (May-November), artificial long (16L:8D) and artificial short (8L:16D) days. Ambient temperature was not controlled. At 22 weeks of age, some of the lambs (n=22) reared in artificial photoperiods were induced to ovulate with progesterone and pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG). Lambs originally given the low energy diet were switched to the high energy diet at 28 weeks of age. The onset of puberty was not influenced by photoperiods, but was affected by diet. By 28 weeks of age the number of lambs ovulating (24/26 vs. 9/29) and the body weight at first ovulation (43.7 ± 1.2 kg vs. 36.7 ± 1.4 kg) were greater (P<0.01) for lambs given the high energy diet. Following dietary switchover of lambs on the low energy diet, the percentage of lambs ovulating increased from 31% to 65% within 31 ± 10 days. Lambs ovulating after dietary switchover weighed 38.8 ± 2.0 kg, while lambs which remained nonpubertal weighed only 29.0 ± 1.5 kg (n=10) by the end of the study. A reduction in growth rate in lambs fed the low energy diet was associated with reduced (P<0.05) plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations. Neither diet nor photoperiod altered the number of lambs (20/22) ovulating following PMSG treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrate an effect of diet upon the attainment of puberty. The results suggest that the growth effect may be mediated via changes in LH secretion. Since first ovulation occurred rather synchronously in the fall, regardless of photoperiod control, other factors such as temperature or endogenous rhythms are implicated in timing sexual maturity.

N2  - A radioimmunological method for measuring saliva cortisol was worked out. It includes one extraction and one radiocompetitive reaction with an anticortisol 3-CMO:BSA immunoserum. Frequent values for saliva cortisol were determined in various physiological and pathological conditions and compared to plasma cortisol values. In adult men, the mean concentrations at 8 a.m and midnight were respectively 14.50 ± 7.10 and 1.40 ± 1.21 nmol/l (x ± SD). In untreated women, plasma and saliva cortisol levels were not significantly different from those measured in women taking estroprogestative drugs or in pregnant women. Following stimulation by synthetic β1-24 ACTH (Synacthen®), the saliva cortisol determined 90 min after the 8 a.m. sampling rose by over 500% whereas plasma cortisol only rose by 120%. Similarly the drop in 8 a.m. cortisol, which followed midnight administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone was larger for saliva than for plasma cortisol. In patients with adrenal hyperactivity the circadian rhythm disappeared from saliva cortisol and patients with deficient adrenal activity displayed drastically reduced levels for saliva cortisol. Saliva cortisol seems thus to be more helpful to diagnosis than plasma cortisol.

N2  - A cross-sectional survey of female office workers in South Australia was initiated to compare the general health experiences of visual display unit (VDU) operators with those of other keyboard workers. Additionally, a matched case-control study, generated from the cross-sectional survey, examined claims of a relationship between VDU exposure and spontaneous abortions. Although poor sleep and nervousness appeared to be significantly associated with the use of VDUs there appeared to be no relationship with nervousness after controlling for other measured risk factors such as age and employer. VDU use was the only statistically significant predictor variable for dizziness and poor sleep, although the statistical significance was marginal. Results of the case-control analysis, provided little evidence that the operation of VDUs during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.

N2  - Investigations were performed to explore changes in fetal toxicity induced by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in pregnant animals treated by various means for maternal alterations. The fetotoxicity induced by ASA (500 mg/kg s.c.) was higher in rats than in mice. In mice with low enzyme activity, those displaying a longer sleeping time in pentobarbital-induced sleep, the ASA-fetotoxicity was higher than that of mice with shorter sleeping time. In rats pretreated with phenobarbital (0.05%), Zn (10 mg/l) and Cu (10 mg/l) in tap water and cysteine (200 mg/kg s.c.), fetal toxicity of ASA was reduced, whereas it was enhanced in rats pretreated with SKF-525A (20 mg/kg s.c.) and α-naphthyl acetic acid (200 mg/kg p.o.) and in nephrectomized rats. The UDPGT activity in hepatic 9000xg supernate was higher in mice than in rats and the activity of mice was increased by phenobarbital and Cu. This study indicates that ASA-induced fetotoxicity can be positively modified by alterations in drug metabolizing activity.

N2  - Doxylamine succinate, a drug used as a sleep-inducing agent, an antihistamine, and in a therapeutic formulation taken by pregnant women as an antinauseant, was scheduled for toxicological evaluation as part of a structure activity relationship study, with rats and mice, because a deficiency of such data exists with regard to many antihistamines. Analytical chemical procedures that ensure proper concentration, homogeneity, and stability of the drug in dosed feed, as well as the safety of personnel and the environment, were prerequisites for the toxicological tests. GC methods using a rubidium-sensitized nitrogen detector were developed for analysis of doxylamine succinate in animal feed, human urine, and wastewater at levels as low as 1 ppm, 100 ppb, and 100 ppb, resectively. Sample extracts were cleaned up by liquid-liquid partitioning, followed by additional cleanup on a column of sicila gel. Data are presented concerning the stability of the drug in animal feed, extraction efficiencies, and the use of the silica gel cleanup column to separate the caffeine interference from doxylamine in extracts of human urine. Partition values and ancillary data concerning analysis of the drug in feed, by HPLC at levels as low as 10 ppm, are also reported.

N2  - Circadian patterns of blood pressure and pressor hormones were studied in late pregnancy in ten normotensive women and twenty-one hypertensives. Plasma renin activity, angiotensin II and free adrenaline and noradrenaline levels were highest at 0900 h in normotensives and uncomplicated hypertensives. Catecholamine sulphate levels were lowest at 0900 h. In eight pre-eclamptic hypertensives, plasma renin activity, and angiotensin II were suppressed. Adrenaline sulphate levels were raised in hypertensives. Four pre-eclamptics with nocturnal hypertension had the highest blood pressures; their diurnal rhythm for noradrenaline sulphate was reversed but they showed no consistent pattern of pressor hormones. However, failure of angiotensin II, adrenaline or noradrenaline to fall at night in subjects with increased vascular reactivity could contribute to their nocturnal hypertension.

N2  - Both clinical and animal studies indicate that prenatal exposure to opiate produces effects that occur in two phases. An acute phase consists of a neonatal abstinence syndrome characterized by increased CNS arousal. The major behavior symptoms seen in both humans and animals include hyperactivity, disturbed sleep and increased lability of state. This early phase can be quite prolonged, lasting from 12 weeks to 6 months in humans and 20-25 days in rats. Although confirming pharmacokinetic studies are needed, it is possible that these persistent symptoms result from the slow clearance of the drug from neonatal tissues. The second phase of the syndrome is less well-understood but the available clinical evidence suggests that exposure to heroin, particularly in a pattern of polydrug abuse, can result in impaired organizational and perceptual abilities, poor self-adjustment and in situations requiring motor inhibition, heightened activity. Studies of pre-school children exposed prenatally to methadone, show no effects on intellectual and cognitive functioning but do reveal heightened activity or energy level, impulsivity, and brief attention span and persistence. A finding of impaired motor inhibition while performing a task has been stressed by one worker as an area of particular vulnerability among these children. A strikingly similar effect, characterized as an impaired ability to modulate task-oriented motor activity, has been described for adult rats prenatally exposed to methadone.

Ten women were between 18 and 25 weeks of pregnancy and 10 women were between 32 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. Blood for the hormone determinations was drawn at hourly intervals. A significant circadian progesterone rhythm was found with the nadir at 8.00 h and the peak around midnight. The progesterone rhythm showed a significant inverse relation to the cortisol rhythm (τ= -0.310). No difference was detected between the two groups for progesterone rhythm or its inverse relation to the cortisol rhythm.

N2  - Cyclic patterns of active and quiet fetal activity were evaluated in 36 clinically normal gravidas between 27 and 42 weeks of gestation. All infants were subsequently delivered between 37 and 42 weeks of gestation, were clinically normal and of appropriate weight for gestational age. Active-quiet cycles occurred less frequently and were of longer duration with increasing gestational age. Regression analysis of the number of active-quiet cycles with gestational age yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.52 (p < 0.01). The similarity of fetal active-quiet cycles and active and quiet sleep cycles observed after birth is noted.

N2  - The effect of sleep state on the respiratory response to hypercapnia was studied in 14 chronic fetal sheep, 125-140 days gestation. Fetal Pa(CO2) was raised by 11 to 34 Torr by gradually increasing the maternal FI(CO2) to 0.09. Fetal sleep state was monitored. Fetal breathing (FB) was analysed in terms of frequency (f), tracheal pressure (TP) and ventilation equivalent (V(Eq)) = ΣTP/min. In 16 out of 17 experiments on apneic fetuses in NREM sleep, the fetuses switched to REM sleep and in 14 instances began to breathe within 2 1/2 min thereafter. The Pa(CO2) at which apneic fetuses started breathing was 54.8 ± 8.4 Torr (x ± SD). In 4 out of 10 trials on breathing fetuses in REM sleep the fetuses switched to NREM sleep and stopped breathing before removal of the CO2 stimulus. During REM sleep hypercapnia stimulated FB by an increase in TP and by a reduction in the number and duration of apneic pauses. It is concluded that in the fetal lamb CO2 stimulates breathing only during REM sleep and that this stimulus is superimposed on the basic mechanism that stimulates spontaneous FB during this sleep state.

N2  - Alterations in thermoregulatory mechanisms related to sleep state may play an important role in the problems of homeostasis experienced by the premature infant. In the adult, homeothermic regulation of body temperature may be suspended during REM. We measured oxygen consumption (V̇O2) in six premature infants 33-35 wk gestation both at thermoneutrality and during a mild thermal stress to determine whether thermoregulatory responses were intact during REM sleep. All infants were studied under radiant warmers. Skin temperature was allowed to fall 7-8 times during a 6-8 h study period while V̇O2, V̇CO2, heart rate and TcPO2 were continuously recorded. Sleep state was scored using EEG, EOG, EMG and behavioral criteria. A total of 1,162 one-min epochs were scored. In all states including REM, V̇O2 was significantly higher during the cool periods. The mean increases: 21.5%, 23.3%, 11.1% and 5.3% for Awake, Indeterminate, REM and NREM respectively. When REM and NREM were compared at thermoneutrality, there was no difference in the V̇O2 (8.80 ± 0.11 and 8.93 ± 0.15 cc/kg/min, mean ± S.E., for REM and NREM, respectively). We conclude that in contrast to the adult, active thermoregulation occurs in the premature infant during REM sleep.

N2  - A description is first given of respiratory activity in the fetus and its control. Evidence suggests that when the fetus makes respiratory movements, it is in a state comparable to REM sleep in the newborn and adult and that in the alternating periods of apnoea, it is in quiet sleep. It does not appear that the respiratory movements are normally regulated by chemical or reflex, e.g. Hering Breuer, inputs though they are enhanced by CO2 and depressed by hypoxia. In the apnoeic periods, breathing movements are virtually impossible to elict by chemical or reflex means. Evidence from examination of peripheral inputs indicate that: the carotid body chemoreceptors are inhibited at receptor level, stimulation of the aortic chemoreceptors affects the circulation only and although pulmonary stretch receptors are active and are excited by inflation of the fetal lung, such inflation does not affect discharge in medullary respiratory units or phrenic nerve. Since there is no real evidence of immaturity of the respiratory system in late gestation and since chemical and most reflex inputs appear to provide an adequate stimulus, it is most probable that the periods of apnoea are caused by an inhibitory process, possible of supra-pontine origin which acts close to medullary respiratory units and effectively inhibits the operation of the automatic component. This inhibitory process may operate periodically; or continuously and be periodically overridden in REM sleep. After birth, breathing is normally continuous and sensitive to lung inflation, CO2 and after a variable delay, to hypoxia. This may be due to the lifting of the inhibitory process allowing activation of the automatic component. However, there is evidence that even in normal, full term infants, full maturation of the automatic component is not complete ultil about three months of age and in the meanwhile, breathing tends to be imperfectly regulated and subject to damped oscillations when disturbed.

N2  - Mammary explants from virgin and pregnant Balb/c mice were incubated with 3H-thymidine, and its incorporation into TCA-precipitable material was determined. In addition, the labeling index of alveolar and ductal epithelial cells was determined by autoradiography. Incorporation of precursor into mammary tissue from pregnant animals was elevated above that of virgin animals on each day of pregnancy. During pregnancy, there were three periods of peak incorporation (on days 3, 7, and 11-15). The labeling index of epithelial cells also increased during this period. Ductal cells had a peak labeling index on day 3 (30%), which dropped thereafter to comparatively low levels (3-6%) for the rest of pregnancy. With the exception of days 1 and 3, the labeling index of ductal cells showed no difference between midnight and noon. Alveolar structures were first observed in histological preparations on day 5 of pregnancy. The labeling index of alveolar cells was higher than that of ductal cells during the rest of pregnancy, and on most days showed a diurnal fluctuation, being greater at midnight than at noon. The labeling index of alveolar cells had peak values at midnight on days 7 (23%) and 11-13 (20%). This daily fluctuation in DNA synthesis by alveolar cells is a circadian rhythm; pregnant animals continued to show this rhythm after 13 days in constant darkness, and animals maintained on a reversed light schedule had a reversed rhythm. Mammary tissue shows a complex pattern of DNA synthesis during pregnancy, reflecting the different characteristics of ductal and alveolar epithelial cells.

N2  - A non-stress test was applied to 186 women with high-risk pregnancy, and an oxytocin provocation test was added immediately. Increased frequency or acceleration of foetal heart rate accompanied by foetal movement was defined as 'reactive' and interpreted as good condition of the foetus. Absence of accelerations adequate in number and magnitude within 30 minutes from testing was considered as alarming. Such tests were defined 'non-reactive'. Such situations could be attributed to temporary hypoxia or sleep of the foetus. Both the number of positive oxytocin provocation tests and perinatal morbidity were higher with significance (p<0.001) in the 'non-reactive' group. One perinatal death occurred in that group. The non-stress test proved to be a non-invasive, harmless method and highly reliable for screening of women for high-risk pregnancy. It enabled better economy of cost and time and in the use of equipment.

N2  - The authors examined the effect of prednisolone-salium succinate administered on the 17th or 18th day of pregnancy on the adrenal function of newborn rats. They found that in doses of 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg it does not affect physiological development or, respectively, the extent of the circadian rhythm or the stress response. However, the adrenal function of newborn animals was significantly inhibited by 30.0 mg/kg as regards its adaptability to extra-uterine life. The authors point out the importance of investigations to determine the adrenal function of newborns following steroid therapy to prevent RDS.

N2  - Responses to brief episodes of occlusion of the middle uterine artery were examined in six fetal sheep in utero between 122 and 140 days of gestation. Continuous recordings were made of fetal breathing movements, electro-cortical (ECoG) and electro-ocular (EOG) activity, arterial pressure and heart rate. Five minutes of unilateral or bilateral arterial occlusion caused fetal hypoxaemia while changes in mean arterial PCI2 and pH were not statistically significant. Occlusions usually led to a cessation of rapid eye movements (REM) and respiratory activity (86% of trials), to the appearance of high-voltage slow waves in the ECoG (84% of trials) and to a fall in heat rate of more than 10% (81% of trials). With the exception of the changes in heart rate, these responses resemble those which frequently occur during non-labour contractions of the uterus. We conclude that the cessation of fetal breathing movements and rapid eye movements and the onset of slow waves in the ECoG seen in association with uterine contractions may be due to the mild hypoxaemia which accompanies them.

N2  - In fetal lambs after 115 days gestation breathing movements become episodic in association with electrocortical differentiation into predominantly high voltage slow or low voltage rapid activity, the latter characteristic of rapid eye movement sleep. Section of the brainstem at or above the colliculi dissociates fetal breathing from electrocortical activity. It is included that breathing is inhibited, towards the end of gestation, by a supracollicular mechanism during high voltage activity. After brainstem transection at the colliculi hypoxia no longer causes an arrest of fetal breathing, which often becomes more vigorous. The arrest of breathing in normal fetuses subjected to mild hypoxia is also attributed to a supracollicular mechanism. The pattern of fetal skeletal movements and of the spinal segmental reflexes is related to electrocortical activity near term; both are suppressed by hypoxia. The hypothesis is discussed of a central control centre, excited directly or indirectly by hypoxia, which inhibits fetal movements including breathing. Its possible location is considered.

N2  - A variety of radioimmunoassays specifically characterized for use with fetal and maternal ovine plasma have been used to measure steroid hormone concentrations in small plasma samples drawn simultaneously from mother and fetus. By repeated sampling from the same animal preparation the changes over time of plasma concentrations of cortisol, pregnenolone and its sulphate, and oestrone and oestrone sulphate have been systematically studied. In animals delivering spontaneously at term the fetal plasma cortisol concentration rises between 120 and 130 days gestation and plays an important part in the maturation of several vital physiological systems, including the fetal thyroid axis. In normal term deliveries and premature deliveries induced by synthetic adrenocorticotropin (ACTH(1-24), 1 microgram h-1), the concentration of oestrone sulphate in maternal plasma increases before the fetal plasma concentration. Fetal and maternal oestrogens are probably important in the control of the low-grade tonic myometrial activity that occurs throughout gestation, in the initiation of labour and in the control of uterine blood flow. Low-grade tonic myometrial activity affects fetal oxygenation, fetal breathing and the fetal sleep state and may constitute a pathway through which the mother influences fetal development, with important physiological and possibly pathological consequences.

N2  - 60 patients, who had given their consent to participation in this study, 17 women and 43 men, of an average age of 42 years and an average body weight of 71 kg, were randomly allocated to 3 premedication groups: 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine (midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum®), check administered p.o., the product was compared with meprobamate and placebo in patients undergoing surgery on the following day. The study covered a total of 83 patients, 57 women and 26 men, 67 of whom where undergoing maxillofacial surgery and 16 gynaecological operations, and was carried out by comparison, in parallel series, of single doses of midazolam (15 mg) with meprobamate (250 mg) and placebo, according to the double-placebo method. The patients, both male and female, whose ages ranged from 18 to 60 years, were included in the study with no distinction between those with sleep disturbances and those without. The criteria for exclusion from the study were pregnancy, allergic states, psychoses, pain and severe deficiency syndromes. A total of 29 variables concerning sleeping and waking, time required to fall asleep, duration and quality of the sleep and the patient's condition on waking, were selected for assessment of the results. The codes were not broken until the end of the trial and the data were analysed statistically by means of the χ2 test. 27 patients received placebo (Group A), 26 midazolam (Group B) and 30 meprobamate (Group C). There were no significant differences between the three groups with regard to sex, age, body weight, heart rate, insomnia, use and dosage of hypnotics and the patients' opinion of their effectiveness. The results of this study show the following: 1. Midazolam and meprobamate lead to a shorter delay in the onset of sleep than does placebo, the time required to fall asleep being shorter with midazolam than with meprobamate. As assessed by the patients themselves, the time required to fall asleep was 103±14 min in Group A, 35±6.08 min in Group B and 68±7.48 min in Group C (A-B, p = 0.00016; A-C, p = 0.0368; B-C, p = 0.0368). The assessments are confirmed by the objective surveillance of the patients, which showed that after 30 min 42% of the subjects of Group B were asleep, compared with 14.8% of those of Group A and 6.6% of those of Group C (A-B, p = 0.026; B-C, p = 0.00016). 2. The mean duration of sleep, as reported by the patients, was longer in Groups B (7.5 h) and C (7.03 h) than in Group A (5.8 h) (A-B, p = 0.006; A-C, p = 0.023). 3. The patients' feeling on walking, in the sence of 'well/unwell' were comparable in Groups A and B, but more 'well' in Group C (A-B, p > 0.05; C-B, p = 0.028; C-A, p = 0.007). This assessment is not, however, confirmed by the physician's evaluation, which only mentions a sensation of physician's evaluation, which only mentions a sensation of 'malaise' in Group A, in relation to Group B (p = 0.05) and Group C (p = 0.005).

KW  - evoked response audiometry

N2  - The introduction of Electric Response Audiometry which can be carried out irrespective of the age of the child tested has enabled a quantitative determination of the hearing threshold to be made in neonates, both full-term and premature. The early diagnosis of any hearing impairment is of great importance for a child's normal speech development. Especially very significant is the examination of children born premature and children known as dysmatured. The purpose of the tests made was to evaluate the cortical response in the newborn from the point of view of the early detectability of hearing impairment, taking into account the course of pregnancy, parturition and the state of the neonate at the time of birth according to Apgar's Scale. The studies were carried out on 195 neonates of whom 165 were born at full-term and 30 were premature, born between the 24th and 36th week of pregnancy, and their birth weight ranged from 600 to 2100 g. In the majority of cases these were children of mothers with case histories of obstetric complications with numerous previous miscarriages. The tests were carried out with the use of an ERA audiometer (Medelec) and an Anops-10 average computer. The children were tested during physiological sleep immediately after feeding, observation of ear-eyelid reaction to a pure tone of a frequency of 1000 Hz and of an intensity of 100 Hz preceded ERA testing. The basis for the evaluation of the organ of hearing was presence or absence of a freely evoked response, most usually in the form of a two-phase or three-phase deflection, to the acoustic stimuli of determined parameters applied. The latent time and amplitude of the individual components of the response evoked were analysed in the response obtained. Summing up the results obtained it may be said that: objective audiometric hearing tests in the newborn are of particular importance not only in the evaluation of hearing in children in whom there is a risk of hearing impairment, but also because valuable information on the process of maturation of the organ of hearing is obtained by tracing the form and distribution of the V-potential. This fact may give evidence that: the number of positive evoked responses changes with the frequency of the stimulus and the maturity of the neonate; in the full-term, group responses were most frequently obtained at 1000 Hz, but in the premature group at 500 Hz; in both groups of children tested, the smallest number of positive responses was observed at 2000 Hz; the latent time of consecutive-response deflections also alters with the frequency of the stimulus and the maturity of the neonate; in both groups of neonates tested the smallest values were found for 1000 Hz; the mean latent-time values are longer in premature than in full-term neonates, and the greatest differences were observed at a frequency of 2000 Hz; P2 for which the highest amplitudes were also obtained, was the response deflection most frequently observed both in the full-term and in the premature groups; the mean amplitude values are lower in premature babies, so that the differences are most distinct at the frequency of 2000 Hz.

N2  - In 1955 a population study in Uppsala comprising about 9,000 school children showed that migraine increased from 1.4% at the age of seven to 5.3% at fifteen. With increasing age there was an increasing predominance of girls. A matched comparison between 73 children with more pronounced migraine and 73 control children showed a greater tendency in the migraine group to abdominal pain, motion sickness, sleep disturbance and orthostatic symptoms. In a longitudinal study lasting 23 years the 73 migraine children were followed-up until all were over 30 years of age. During puberty and as young adults 62% were free from migraine for at least two years. Of these, 22% again suffered migraine regularly. Thus, 60% had migraine attacks at 30. Girls seem to have a greater relapse rate than boys. Most of the girls with classical migraine were headache free during pregnancy. Every third family with one parent belonging to the migraine group and with children over four years of age had one child with migraine symptoms. Migraine seems to be more frequently inherited via the mother, and to girls.

N2  - It has been suggested that the decrease in blood pressure during sleep is greater in patients with chronic hypertension than in preeclamptic patients. The DINAMAP (device for in direct noninvasive automatic mean pressure) monitor was used to determine the mean arterial, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure, at 15-minute intervals, for 24 hours. Three groups of 15 patients each were studied: mildly preeclamptic, chronically hypertensive, and normotensive patients in the third trimester. In addition, 2 patients with severe preeclampsia were studied. The automatic readings were compared with auscultated blood pressures. There was short-term variation in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 20 to 40 and 15 to 30 mmHg, respectively, with consecutive 15-minute recordings. A decrease in blood pressure during sleep was seen in all groups, except in the 2 patients with severe preeclampsia. This fall varied between 5 and 20 mmHg systolic and 5 and 18 mmHg diastolic. The auscultated blood pressure differed from the automatic blood pressure by 5 to 40 mmHg systolic and 5 to 35 mmHg diastolic. In the clinical management of patients, these findings are significant, as they demonstrate short-term variation in blood pressure and differences in the auscultated versus automatic blood pressure readings. Also, changes in blood pressure occur during sleep; this may be important with regard to the timing and dose of medication given to pregnant patients with chronic hypertension or preeclampsia.

N2  - Dams from two inbred strains of mice (C57BR and BALB/c)were treated with caffeine in solution in their drinking water during gestation. Doses of caffeine used corresponded to about 60, 80 or 100 mg/kg/day; controls received tap water. The offspring (as adults) revealed a significantly increased sleep time following caffeine treatment, but primarily as slow wave sleep in the males of the BALB/c strain and paradoxical sleep in the females of the C57BR strain. BALB/c females and C57BR males were relatively unaffected. These results, and in particular the sex differences, are discussed in terms of a possible central site of action of caffeine.

N2  - Heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been associated with retardation of fetal growth and abnormal fetal development. Pregnant women whose offspring are at risk because of alcohol abuse can be identified and counselled by health professionals providing prenatal care. Offspring born to women who had been drinking heavily and subsequently abstained from or reduced their intake of alcohol before the third trimester demonstrated improvement in growth and in regulation of sleep-awake states. The existing health care delivery system can be modified in a cost-effective manner to treat pregnant women who are problem drinkers. Physicians' attitudes and behaviour are critical for the success of this strategy.

Data from a sample of 728 males and females aged eleven to sixteen indicated that drinkers were more likely to report health problems. The correlation between drinking and poor health was most noted among young males and older females. Drinkers reported more sleep disturbances. Tobacco use was the most positive predictor of drinking among males and pregnancy for females.

KW  - normal human
KW  - sleep
N2  - Several interdisciplinary aspects relating to the maturation of central nervous functions and to the possible beginning of mental life in the foetus have been discussed. Particular attention has been paid to (i) the motor functions present in the foetus at early stages of development and characterized by phasic and tonic, spontaneous and reflex movements; (ii) the sensory functions that endow the foetus with the possibility of being receptive to stimuli that reach him from the maternal container in a rhythmic constant form; (iii) the integrative functions shown by a state of active sleep with movements of the eyes (certainly present after the 28-30th week of pregnancy) and of the body. In analogy with what happens in the mature brain, the hypothesis has been made that active sleep constitutes a 'biological framework' within which the sensory experiences coming through the maternal container are transformed by the foetus into 'internal representations'. Such an operation would constitute the beginning of a protomental activity in evolution, which would build itself around a nucleus of an instinctual nature transmitted genetically from the parents in the form of representations. The analogies that this prenatal psychic nucleus might have with preconceptions have also been discussed, as well as the role that can be attributed to active sleep in favouring the maturation of the psychological function of the 'skin' which in turn may be able to contain the Self of the child and to protect it from disintegrating under the pressure of the impulses that come into play at the moment of birth.

N2  - We have used cell-type-specific markers to study the development of neurones and glial cells in dissociated cell cultures of 10-day embryonic rat brain. Tetanus-toxin-binding neurones and phagocytic macrophages with surface receptors for IgG were present from the beginning of such cultures. GFAP+ astrocytes developed after 5-6 days, ependymal cells with beating cilia after 7-8 days, and galactocerebroside+ oligodendrocytes after 13-14 days in culture. When cultures were prepared from 13-day embryonic brain, these glial cells developed 3 days earlier than they did in cultures of 10-day embryonic brain. When freshly isolated cell suspensions from brains of embryos at various ages were studied, we found that the development of specific neural cells in vivo precisely paralleled their development in vitro. Thus glial cells develop right on schedule in dissociated cell cultures suggesting that biological clocks are more important than positional information in gliogenesis after 10 days gestation. We demonstrate that rat neural antigen-2 (Ran-2) which is defined by a monoclonal antibody is expressed on astrocyte precursors.

N2  - Controversy regarding the presence of a circadian rhythm in unconjugated estriol in serum during pregnancy led us to study the possibility that the observed rhythms actually are the result of partitioning of estriol into serum lipids when these increase postprandially. Addition of triglycerides to purified estriol standards significantly decreased (p<0.001) apparent estriol as detected by radioimmunoassay after separation on dextran-coated charcoal and significantly increased (p<0.001) estriol as detected by radioimmunoassay after double-antibody separation. Compensation for individual nonspecific binding of standards nullified te effect of lipids only in systems involving dextran-coated charcoal separation, incubated for 1.0 h at 37°C followed by 1.0 h at 4°C. In contrast to other protocols, data obtained with this system revealed no significant circadian variation in serum estriol concentrations in normal pregnant women (CV, 4.3%). Evidently, reported variations in apparent serum estriol concentration are artifactual.

N2  - We have investigated the variability of four hormonal parameters used for the endocrine monitoring of the third trimester of pregnancy (E3, E4, HPL, SP1). We have observed no circadian rhythm of Estriol, Estetrol, HPL and SP1. The within-a-day and the day-to-day variations are much greater for E4 than for E3 and for HPL than for SP1. The standard deviations were great for the steroids, especially for E4 and much less for the protein hormones, especially SP1. This implies that it is necessary to have serial assays of the steroids to have any confidence in the levels, while good monitoring could be guaranteed with a smaller number of assays for HPL and SP1.

N2  - Respiratory responses to hypercapnia were studied in seven chronic in utero fetal lambs between 105 and 138 days' gestation (16 expts). Fetal arterial CO2 tension was raised (mean increase 9.9 Torr) by altering maternal inspired gas concentrations. Diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) was recorded as the index of respiratory activity. Electrocortical and electroocular activity (3 fetuses) were monitored in an attempt to define sleep state. Average respiratory rate increased (90%) and fetal apnea decreased (60%) during hypercapnia. Mean respiratory rate during 'on' periods (>6 EMG bursts/min) increased significantly during hypercapnia throughout the gestational epoch studied. Mean duration of the inspiratory time (TI) showed no significant change. Variability in both rate and TI decreased in response to CO2 at all gestations. Integrated EMG activity per burst divided by TI increased significantly at all gestations; however, no gestational increase in responsiveness to CO2 was seen. Sleep states were not able to be consistently identified, and a quantifiable electrocortical response to CO2 was not observed. These results indicate a relatively early functional maturation of fetal respiratory responses to CO2.

N2  - Respiratory activity (diaphragmatic electromyogram) was recorded in six unanesthetized in utero fetal lambs, between 0.7 of gestation and term. Respiratory patterns generated by the fetus showed developmental changes that included 1) an emergence of a periodic modulation of respiratory rate producing alternating active and quiet phases (mean cycle length of 37 min between 130 and 140 days' gestation; 2) an increase in percentage apnea (expiratory time >10 s) from 20% at 110 days to 60% at 140 days; and 3) a linear decrease in the 2-h average respiratory rate, while mean rate during active phases showed no consistent gestational decline. Electrocortical and electroocular activity was monitored in three of six fetuses; however, discrete sleep state patterns could not be consistently identified. The results demonstrate a gestational change in the respiratory patterns of the developing fetus and suggest an orderly maturation of the mechanisms controlling respiratory neuronal output.

N2  - In order to examine the effect of endogenous rhythms in fetal and/or maternal adrenal activity on diurnal changes in plasma estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and progesterone (P) in women at 34 to 35 weeks' gestation, we measured these steroids in a group of six women in whom the endogenous circadian rhythm in cortisol was absent or had been suppressed by treatment with exogenous synthetic glucocorticoids. All steroids were suppressed, and no diurnal rhythms in E1, E2, E3 or P were found. Suppression of cortisol and estrogens was greater after dexamethasone (Dx) than after a glucocorticoid-equivalent dosage of prednisone (Pd). Loss of the maternal estrogen rhythms seen in normal patients is consistent with the suggestion that such rhythms may be attributable to diurnal changes in maternal and/or fetal adrenal output of potential precursors. The differences in cortisol and estrogen concentrations after Dx and Pd may indicate dissociation of the glucocorticoid (hyperglycemia) and adrenocorticotropic hormone-suppressing activities of these compounds.

N2  - This study was designed to provide normative data on fetal heart rate (FHR), FHR variability, accelerations, and decelerations during maternal sleep in the third trimester of pregnancy and to identify rhythmicity in FHR variability. Twenty-four polygraphic recordings were obtained in 16 pregnant women at 32 and 36 weeks' gestation. FHR parameters were not predictably influenced by maternal sleep states. Cyclic changes in FHR variability with median cycle length of 53 minutes were observed. Accelerations and decelerations occurred an average of 12.2 and 4 times per 100 minutes, respectively. Bradycardia and tachycardia persisting beyond 10 minutes were not seen. FHR variability ranged from marked to decreased within recordings of the same subject; this observation has implications for non-stress testing of the fetus.

N2  - Fetal breathing movements were measured in six women who had received exogenous glucocorticoids throughout pregnancy and in whom the endogenous circadian rhythm in cortisol was absent or had been suppressed. Studies were performed for 24-hour observation periods while women received prednisone and then one week later on the same women after equivalent doses of dexamethasone. Fetal breathing movements occurred 29.9% ± 1.9% of the time in the prednisone-treated group and this was not changed in the same fetuses after dexamethasone treatment. There was a significant increase in the percentage of time spent making breathing movements during the second and third hours following breakfast, lunch, and dinner (P<0.001). A fourth peak in fetal breathing activity occurred in the late evening and seemed to be related to the time of the evening glucocorticoid medication. These data were compatible with the hypothesis that maternal glucocorticoid concentrations may influence patterns of fetal breathing movements at 34 to 35 weeks' gestational age.

N2  - Seventy cases of sickle-cell disease were identified in the London Borough of Brent from records dating back to 1962. All but 3 were still alive and, with one exception, were recalled for confirmation of the diagnosis and to provide personal and family histories. The group consisted of 22 individuals with homozygous sickle-cell anaemia (Hb SS), 12 with sickle-cell/beta-thalassaemia double heterozygosity, 34 with sickle-cell/haemoglobin C disease (Hb SC), and 2 with the combination of haemoglobin S and hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin. They were predominantly of West Indian origin, more than half had been born in Britain, and most were aged under 25. The records for 304 patient admissions between 1962 and 1979 were analysed. There were 199 sickle-cell-disease-related admissions, 61 unrelated to sickle-cell disease, and 44 for pregnancy or its complications. Admissions per patient-year averaged less than one, except for children with Hb SS under the age of 5 years, who were admitted more frequently. The commonest reasons for admission were painful crises (74% of all admissions) and the 'chest syndrome' (21%). There were 4 pneumococcal infections, all in children with Hb SS under the age of 8 years; all recovered. Three patients, aged 10, 15, and 50 years, died. The two children with Hb SS died in their sleep without gross evidence of sickling at necropsy. Multiple brain infarcts were found at necropsy in the 50-year-old woman with Hb SC who, having survived 9 uneventful pregnancies, succumbed to an infection after cryosurgery to the cervix. Obstetric records were available for 18 term pregnancies in 11 women. Three antenatal sickling crises and 3 postpartum thromboembolic complications were encountered. There were no maternal or perinatal deaths. Fifteen asymptomatic individuals with sickle-cell disease were diagnosed as a result of routine screening procedures. There are likely to be many such individuals currently undiagnosed in the community. They urgently need identification because of their increased risks from pregnancy, surgery, and infection.

N2  - Human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), a stimulator of the growth of a variety of tissues, appears to be identical to human β-urogastrone (hUG), an inhibitor of stimulated gastric acid secretion. Using immune affinity chromatography to extract hEGF from plasma, we have measured plasma concentrations of immunoreactive (IR) hEGF/UG. Plasma IR hEGF/UG extracted by immune affinity column was immunologically, biologically, and physicochemically indistinguishable from highly purified hEGF standard isolated from human urine. Concentrations of plasma IR hEGF/UG in normal males and females were 163.4 ± 13.7 and 138.5 ± 6.9 pg/ml (mean ± SE), respectively; there was no significant sex difference (P > 0.2). Neither the half-hourly plasma concentrations nor the urinary excretion of IR hEGF/UG in two normal young subjects showed any apparent circadian periodicity. There was no significant correlation (P > 0.1) between concentrations of IR hEGF/UG and hGH during the 24-h study. Concentrations of plasma IR hEGF/UG in pregnant women (121.2 ± 6.0 pg/ml) were not significantly different (P> 0.1) from those in nonpregnant women. Renal clearance of endogenous IR hEGF/UG appears to be similar to that of creatinine. The present study has established the concentrations of IR hEGF/UG in normal human plasma. The results suggest that plasma levels of IR hEGF are unrelated to sex, ingestion of meals, sleep-wake activity, or pregnancy, and hEGF/UG is cleared from plasma mostly by renal glomerular filtration.

N2  - It is suggested that there exists a competitive antagonist of the cholinergic system which is secreted during sleep, pregnancy, and acute stress. A biochemical model of the sleep cycle is presented. It is suggested that normally the putative cholinergic antagonist is metabolized rapidly upon being released from the cholinergic receptor. Defective metabolism of this putative cholinergic antagonist is hypothesized to be one cause of hypotonic schizophrenia.

N2  - The blood concentration of sodium oxybutyrate has been determined in the mother and the fetus in 40 parturients after obstetrical anesthesia and also in 34 women after removal of the fetus following caeserean section. The blood concentration of sodium oxybutyrate in the fetus depended on the dose and time lag after administration of the drug. After the rest sleep no signs of anesthetic depression in the fetus could be recorded. In 7 out of 34 neonates delivered by caeserean section under sodium oxybutyrate have been found (141 ± 3.2 mg/l in the umbilical vein and 110±2.5 mg/l in the umbilical artery), reaching up to 80-70% of the maternal figures and capable of delaying the restoration of spontaneous respiration in the fetus. With upset of the utero-placental circulation the passage of the anesthetic through the placenta is decreased.

N2  - Electrocorticogram (ECoG), electromyogram (EMG) of the lateral rectus and antigravity muscles (neck and masseter) and breathing activity (FB) were monitored in chronically prepared fetal sheep of 125-140 days gestation and in newborn lambs up to 11 days postnatal age. Awake state (AW), non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) were defined using standard criteria for ECoG, eye movements and postural muscle tone. The percentage of time the fetuses spent in each state was: NREM sleep 53%, REM sleep 41.4%, and AW 5.6%. Spontaneous intrauterine breathing activity occurred only during REM sleep, but 35% of REM sleep was not associated with FB. Gasps (isolated deep inspirations) appeared occasionally throughout the recording and were not related to any specific sleep state or wakefulness. In the fetus, the monosynaptic reflex (MSR) induced by direct electrical stimulation of the fibular nerve was enhanced by about 75% during REM sleep compared to NREM and AW. In the newborn lamb the adult pattern of suppression of MSR during REM sleep was not seen until several days after birth.

N2  - Long daytime EEG-polygraph recordings were obtained at 36, 38, and 40 weeks conceptional age, weekly thereafter for 12 weeks, and at 26 and 52 weeks post term in 5 infants born at 30-33 weeks gestation. The babies have developed normally for 18-38 months. All 74 EEGs were normal for age. Derived data were compared with similar data from 17 normal full-term infants. The trace alternant pattern disappeared earlier in the premature than in the control group (mean ages 21.4 vs. 33.4 days post term; P < 0.01). Rolandic sleep spindles appeared earlier in the premature group (mean ages 35.4 vs. 43.8 days; P < 0.05). There were no age differences between the groups with respect to (1) the shift from active sleep onset to quiet sleep onset, (2) active sleep and quiet sleep as percentages of total sleep time, or (3) disappearance of frontal sharp waves. Overall attainment of 'infantile' EEG sleep patterns occurred at 35-60 days post term (mean 43.8) for the premature group and at 27-66 days (mean 46.4) for the full-term group (difference not significant). These findings indicate that no significant errors will be made in clinical practice by applying the same maturational criteria to the post-term EEGs of prematures as to the EEGs of full-term infants.

N2  - The concentration of blood and plasma glucose in developing, pregnant and post-partum rats has been determined under uniform conditions of housing, feeding and circadian rhythms. The glucose content of erythrocytes and of the plasma compartment has been estimated using the packed cell hematocrit value as a correction factor. During pregnancy and fetal development there were significant reductions in the proportion of intracellular glucose, and significant increases during the suckling and weaning period. There was no direct relationship with plasma insulin levels. Results are discussed in relation to aspects of metabolism specific to the physiological components of the breeding cycle studied; plasma glucose homeostasis is held very constant; both intraerythrocytic and plasma concentrations should be considered when studying glucose homeostasis in given physiological situations.

N2  - Between 106 and 144 days' gestation, periods of uterine electromyographic (EMG) activity and associated increases in uterine tone (contractures) were accompanied by a change in fetal ocular activity in 294 (63%) of 467 cases. In 260 (88.4%) of the changes, there was a switch from the active to nonactive state. The incidence of this change was significantly greater (p<0.01) than the switch from the nonactive to the active state. The fetal electrocorticogram changed state in 34 (74%) of 46 contractures, the change being from low-amplitude to high-amplitude activity in 28 (82%) of the cases. This difference was significant (p<0.01). Fetal breathing movements (FBM), as indicated by activity of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, changed in 134 (55%) of 243 contractures, the change being from active to the quiescent state in 115 (85%) of contractures. Diaphragmatic activity changed in 111 (61%) of 183 contractures, with a change from activity to quiescence occurring in 100 instances (90%). Changes in tracheal pressure were associated with an altered state of FBM in 190 (61%) of 314 contractures, and the change was from the presence of FBM to absence of them in 178 (94%) of the changes. In all three of these indicators of FBM, the change from breathing activity to quiescence was statistically significant (p<0.01).

N2  - The sleep of 52 children suffering from febrile seizures were recorded. Their waking EEGs were free of epileptic activity. Only a few patients fell asleep without medication, the majority received 2 mg/kg body weight of promazine hydrochloride. Epileptic activity occurred in the sleep EEG of 15 out of 52 patients (29%). Exclusively short generalized paroxysms of high amplitude, mostly irregular and partially abortive 3-4/sec spike-wave complexes and occasional 2.5/sec sharp-slow-wave complexes were recorded. Epileptic discharges were detected in the B stage in 11 patients, in the C stage in 10 patients, in the A stage in 7 patients and in the stage D in two patients. They were recorded more often in cases where more than one seizure had occurred, and where the patients were more than two years of age. Generalized spikes and waves were also seen most frequently in the case of so-called complicated febrile convulsions. Although there were differences in the cases of females, in incidences of a family history of seizures and delayed toilet training, these were not statistically significant. Likewise, a complicated pregnancy and birth as well as a delayed stato-motoric development showed no correlation. These results together with other findings justify the conclusion that the majority of febrile convulsions should be classified among the primary generalized epilepsies.

N2  - The possible effects of work and rest in pregnancy were assessed in a group of women with premature births, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal mortality and other major disorders. From the results it can be concluded that women who work during pregnancy show an increased risk of intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal mortality and major malformations. The risk of intrauterine growth retardation applies mainly to work carried out in a standing position. With regard to the risk of a premature birth, a higher risk level was shown by women who walked a lot in their work during the 2nd trimester. Lifting heavy loads and travelling regularly by bus also appeared to increase risks. Although seven to 10 hours of sleep are suggested as optimal, further research is necessary to assess the risks of too much and too little sleep.

N2  - Real-time scanners have permitted investigators to measure fetal breathing movements during pregnancy in humans. It has been demonstrated that fetal breathing movements are episodic and occur about 30% of the time during the last 10 wk of pregnancy. Design of studies must account for the episodic nature of fetal breathing movements. It will be important to account for the relationship of fetal breathing movements to maternal meals, time of day, and gestational age of fetuses. Furthermore, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and drugs may alter fetal breathing measurements. Finally, fetal breathing movements are absent during accelerated labor and may normally be diminished during the last 3 days prior to spontaneous term labor. Measurement of fetal breathing movements using real-time scanners has helped to understand circadian rhythms in fetal life and may ultimately be of use in the assessment of fetal health. It is important that much more information be obtained concerning factors that normally influence fetal breathing movements before proper strategies can be suggested for the use of these measurements in the clinical assessment of fetal health.

N2  - Diurnal changes in the concentrations of oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2) in maternal peripheral plasma have been measured in samples of blood taken at one hour intervals from women at 30 to 31, 34 to 35 and 38 to 39 weeks of pregnancy. There was a significant effect of time of sampling on the plasma concentration of E1 at all stages of gestation, and circadian changes in the levels of E1 were apparent at 34 to 35 and 38 to 39 weeks. Peak values were measured around 0830 to 0930 hours, and troughs occurred between 0130 and 0530 hours. Significant effects of time of sampling on the plasma concentration of E2 were found at 34 to 35 and 38 to 39 weeks of pregnancy; night-time concentrations were lower than the peak values at 0730 to 0830 hours. The relation of these changes to the circadian rhythms in the concentrations of cortisol and oestriol in maternal plasma are discussed.

N2  - The question is discussed whether odontological manipulations are permissible during pregnancy and menstruation, whether contraindications exist and whether precautionary measures should be taken. For many decades it has been a much-debated question, and not only among laymen, whether odontological treatment or extractions during pregnancy may bring about abortion and whether even minor odontological interventions, impairing the general condition and sleep, may endanger pregnancy.

N2  - Measurement of fetal breathing movements (FBM) has found considerable clinical interest since it is thought to be predictive of fetal health or compromise. However, assessments of FBM within short observation periods of 30 min duration are suspect of being influenced substantially by factors other than fetal distress and therefore may not be representative for fetal health state. From results of previous investigations it was assumed that fetal state behavior might have a major influence on FBM assessment. Simultaneous recordings of FHR and fetal motor activity (for assessment of state behavior) and FBM were performed in 20 patients with uncomplicated pregnancies near term. Duration of recordings was 107.3 ± 39.5 min. In 24.3 ± 16.5% of time FBM were present in our total recordings. During 15 periods of quiet sleep FBM were seen in 13.8% of time. In nearly half of these periods no breathing activity at all was seen. But only in 2 of these periods stop and start of breathing movements coincided with the beginning and end of the period, whereas in 3 of these periods only stop or start of breathing movements coincided with the beginning or end of the period. During 8 periods of active sleep FBM were seen in 29.5% of time. In none of these sleep periods no breathing at all could be seen. Duration of nonbreathing periods ranged from 6 sec to 46 min. Nonbreathing periods of 30 min and longer contributed only .22% to the total number of nonbreathing periods but still 10% to total nonbreathing time. Results of our study revealed that sporadic measurement of FBM for 30 min duration may be inadequate for diagnosis of FBM in 30 min observation periods may be influenced substantially by factors other than fetal health state. Furthermore it revealed that coordination of state behavior and breathing activity in the human fetus is only relative.

N2  - Observations such as those reviewed help define the ontogeny of the fetal and neonatal respiratory system. Obviously, the central and motor pathways of the fetal respiratory systems are active 'in utero' and respiration at birth is part of a continuing process. At the time of birth marked changes take place within the respiratory system leading to a stabilization of respiratory activity and alterations in the processes which control the species' response to hypoxia and carbon dioxide. The striking intervention of periods of diaphragmatic silence as term approaches with periods similar to activity state changes within the central nervous system, emphasizes the important role that the higher neural centers play in the control of fetal respiratory activity. The characteristics of the activity of the fetal diaphragm when it is operating changes little over the last third of gestation suggesting in simple terms a central 'state' generator acting on an otherwise continuously oscillating network of central respiratory neurones. 'In utero' where peripheral afferent input is reduced, the respiratory neurones require the input of an 'active central nervous system' to operate in a behavioral mode (REM sleep). However after birth even when the central nervous system is in a 'quiet' metabolic mode of operation, e.g., non-REM sleep, peripheral afferent input is sufficient to reduce the threshold of the respiratory neurones to permit them to operate. Fetal respiratory activity 'in utero' permits not only neuromuscular and skeletal development of the respiratory system to take place but enables appropriate respiratory epithelial development of the gas exchanging surfaces of the lung.

N2  - The authors interviewed 200 pregnant women and another 200 patients on their own maternity ward to find out their views and wishes regarding pain-reducing procedures during delivery, with or without reduced consciousness in the course of labour. Only 13% of them wanted to sleep during delivery, while almost 90% insisted on being kept fully alert and to play an active role in childbirth. Yet, there has been a growing demand for analgetic treatment among maternity ward patients, which obviously, has been attributable to birth trauma. For example, the percentage of women who asked for peridural anesthesia grew from 36 ante-partum to 64 post-partum. The replies given by the patients were then related to the results of transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TNS) and cerebral electric stimulation (CES). Both methods had good effects on more than 50% of the cases and partial effects on 25 to 30%. The authors feel that those no-risk simple methods should give good results in most cases in terms of less labour pain with full consciousness. Other methods, with a higher risk, might be reserved for patients on whom simple methods fail.

N2  - By the development of highly specific antisera against estrone (E1), estradiol-17β (E2) and estriol (E3) a radioimmunoassay method for the measurement of these homones in maternal blood has been established without preceding chromatographic separation steps. The mean serum level of unconjugated E1, E2 and E3 during the luteal phase amounts to 0.58 ± 0.17 ng/ml (E1), 0.32 ± 0.13 ng/ml (E2) and 0.08 ± 0.02 ng/ml (E3), resp. Until the end of gestation the values rise to 14.3 ± 6.8 ng/ml (E1), 16.0 ± 4.3 ng/ml (E2) and 14.1 ± 4.6 ng/ml (E3). The fluctuations of the unconjugated estrogens, especially E3, exhibit over short and long periods a mean coefficient of variation between 14 and 16%, a significant circadian rhythm being only evident for E1. The surveillance of early pregnancy by determination of estrogens in maternal blood is only of limited diagnostic values, since in the first weeks of gestation estrogen synthesis does not only take place in the placenta but also in the ovary. In the second half of pregnancy especially unconjugated E3 seems to be an excellent parameter for assessment of feto-placental function and thereby the detection of fetal risks. However, determinations in blood must be specific for E3, since the share of unconjugated E3 as compared to the concentration of free E1 and E2 is only 30% and the measurement of E1 and/or E2 for the surveillance of the feto-placental function is only of limited value. Comparing studies of the urinary excretion of total estrogens and inconjugated E3 in blood in 1166 pregnancies demonstrate that either determination gives the same correct information of the fetal state. Our results show that the eminent value of the measurement of E3 has to be seen in the detection of intrauterine growth retardation. This is possible at an early stage in 70-75%.

N2  - Plasma progesterone, pregnancy maintenance, gestation period, and litter size were measured in mice unilaterally ovariectomized on day of pregnancy (plug day = day 0) and then treated daily with dieldrin (2 mg/kg-1, p.o.). By days 15-16, dieldrin had reduced the pentobarbital sleep time by 54% (P < 0.05), increased the liver mass by 8% (P < 0.05), and increased hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 by 66% (P < 0.05). However, the levels of plasma progesterone in the hemiovariectomized, dieldrin-treated mice were not different from those in the hemiovariectomized controls. Other experiments showed that hemiovariectomy decreased plasma progesterone by about 25%. Moreover, hemiovariectomy increased the frequency of premature delivery but it did not affect litter size; dieldrin treatment did not alter these effects. The failure of the induction to reduce plasma progesterone could result from (1) increased progesterone synthesis compensating for its elevated metabolism or (2) no (net) increase in progesterone metabolism.

N2  - This experiment analysed the circadian and ultradian pattern of secretion of cortisol and prolactin in cattle, and from this a meaningful sampling technique for these hormones has been suggested. Two Friesian and two Jersey heifers, non-pregnant and 18 months of age, were bled (2 ml blood) every 10 min for 24 h via an indwelling jugular cannula inserted 6 h before sampling commenced. The concentration of cortisol in plasma showed an ultradian rhythm with an amplitude of approximately 30 ng/ml and a frequency of about 0.6 cycles/h. Elimination of the ultradian component of variation, by taking the mean of the rolling means (last three values) for individual heifers, indicated a diurnal variation in cortisol concentration which was high between midnight and midmorning and low in the afternoon. There were frequent sporadic "bursts' of prolactin secretion but these were inconsistent. There was no evidence of diurnal variation in prolactin concentration, or of a temporal relationship between cortisol and prolactin secretion.

N2  - Female mice (genetically heterogeneous stock) were fed milled mouse food containing 3 g/kg phenobarbital (PhB) and water as their only nutritional source from gestation days 9 - 18. Control dams received milled food and water. Blood PhB levels of treated females and fetuses were 40 - 200 μg/ml. At the age of 50 days, male offspring were injected with 3.5 g/kg ethanol. Sleep time was monitored and in randomly selected individuals, brain ethanol levels were determined upon awakening. To assess the rate of metabolism in the treated and control offspring, blood ethanol levels were determined in other randomly selected individuals at 60 and 120 min post-injection. Offspring who receivied PhB prenatally were resistant to the hyponotic effects of ethanol as evidenced by their 33% shorter sleep time compared to controls (P < 0.001). The brain ethanol levels upon awakening were higher than control in the offspring born to the barbiturate-treated mothers (P < 0.001), indicating that the resistance to ethanol was due to factors residing within the central nervous system.

N2  - The pattern of prolactin (PRL) secretin following mating consists of two daily surges, one nocturnal and the other diurnal. Under a photoperiod of 14L : 10D, the most commonly used lighting regime, the nocturnal PRL surge occurs at about 7 h after the onset of the dark phase. The present study investigated the influence of various photoperiods, constant light and dark and suprachiasmatic nucleus lesion (SCN) on the initiation and expression of the nightly PRL surges. Females were divided into five groups and each group was exposed to a different photoperiod. The five experimental photoperiods were: 22L : 2D, 19L : 5D, 14L : 10D, 8L : 16D and 3L : 21D. Following at least 8 weeks of exposure to a photoperiod the females were mated. Multiple daily blood samples for PRL determination (RIA) were obtained via chronic intra-atrial cannulae. In females exposed to a decreased period of darkness the nocturnal PRL surge was advanced with respect to the onset of the dark phase. Conversely, an increase in the length of the dark period to over 10h/day caused a delay in the appearance of the PRL surge. When the timing of the PRL surge is calculated with respect to the midpoint of the dark or light cycle, it occurs at about the same time under all but the most extreme photoperiod (3L:21D). Prior to the experiments using constant dark or constant light the animals were habituated to the lighting conditions for 4 months. In constant darkness the nocturnal PRL surge was synchronized among all animals and peaked in the early morning; its magnitude and duration were greater than under both constant light and alternating light schedules. In constant light, irregular elevations of PRL were seen throughout the day. No elevation of PRL was found in SCN-lesioned animals following cervical stimulation. The present study demonstrates that the nocturnal PRL surges during pregnancy and pseudopregnancy are entrained to photoperiod, can be shifted within limits under various photoperiods and cannot be initiated following lesions in the SCN. On the basis of this and other studies, it is proposed that the nocturnal PRL surge resembles other endogenous circadian rhythms in the rat, but requires the external stimulation of mating for its occurrence.

N2  - The concentration of ovine placental lactogen (oPL) was measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma samples from chronically catheterized ewes and their fetuses from day 110 of gestation to term (about day 145). Concentrations of oPL in the plasma of the mother and fetus were raised after surgery, and remained raised for 3-5 days after the operation. Concentrations of oPL were greatest in the fetus at days 120-124 of gestation, and then declined until delivery. Mean concentrations of oPL in the fetus in late pregnancy for single, twin and triplet pregnancies were 101 ± 6 (S.E.M.), 100 ± 11 and 117 ± 59 ng/ml respectively and were not significantly different. Mean concentrations of oPL in the mother in late pregnancy for single, twin and triplet pregnancies were 718 ± 227, 1387 ± 160 and 1510 ± 459 ng/ml respectively; the difference between these means was significant (P < 0.05). Peak concentrations were noted at days 130-139 of gestation after which concentrations fell and were significantly lower on the day of delivery (P < 0.01). Concentrations of oPL in the mother showed no circadian rhythm. The mean concentrations of oPL in maternal plasma during late pregnancy were significantly correlated to the combined fetal weight at birth (r = 0.624, P < 0.01).

N2  - Occupational trends in the career of flight attendants are undergoing dramatic changes. Career duration of U.S. flight attendants has extended from approximately 2 years in the 1950's to potentially more than 30 years in the late 1970's. The U.S. Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 As Amended allows flight attendants who are capable of working to continue until the age of 70 if they so desire. Into the 1960's the airlines required female flight attendants to be unmarried, with termination of employment upon marriage, with termination of employment upon marriage, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act ultimately brought an end to this policy in the early 1970's. Now, more than half of the flight attendants are married. Into the 1970's, if a flight attendant became pregnant, her employment was terminated by the airlines. Today several U.S. airlines allow flight attendants with uncomplicated pregnancies to work up to, and sometimes into the third trimester of pregnancy, with return to flight attendant duties several weeks after delivery. Into the 1960's, young Caucasian female flight attendants were sought who were petite and who fell within very restricted height and weight limits. Today there is a much wider range allowed in these dimensions and more males and minority groups are incorporated in the ranks. The flight attendant is universally recognized today as the primary cabine safety factor in the event of inflight or ground emergencies. Indeed, the U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations specify the critical nature of flight attendant safety duties. No longer do various segments of the industry view the flight attendant as primarily an airborn waitress. In actuality, the occupation of flight attendant is performed in an environment that involves exposure to the forces of inflight accelerations, circadian rhythm desynchronosis, and other environment factors plus the ever-present potential for turbulence injuries, decompressions, combative passengers, and accidents. Preventive medicine aspects of the modern flight attendant's occupation include maintaining physical fitness and mental alertness. The flight attendant is an absolutely essential crew member in modern aviation and in the future will have increasing responsibilities. Improved and extended preventive medicine programs for flight attendants are indicated.

MAM-induced microencephalic rats revealed a significant increase of spindle bursts during PS, suggesting that their PS is less deep than that of the controls.

N2  - In order to examine the relationship between circadian rhythms in different steroids, cortisol and estriol were measured by radioimmunoassay in maternal venous plasma taken at 30-to 60-minute intervals over 24 hours from nine healthy women at 30 to 31, 11 at 34 to 35, and 10 at 38 to 39 weeks' gestation. Maternal cortisol was maximal at 0730 to 0830 hours and fell significantly to its lowest concentration between 1830 and 0130 hours. At 30 to 31 and 34 to 35 weeks there was a significant circadian rhythm in estriol concentrations which was inversely related to the circadian rhythm in cortisol. At 38 to 39 weeks mean estriol concentrations were significantly higher than those at 30 to 31 and 34 to 35 weeks but there was no significant circadian pattern. We concluded that there is an inverse relationship between maternal cortisol and estriol at 30 to 31 and 34 to 35 weeks, which would be consistent with a maternal effect on fetal adrenal function. The increase in mean concentration and absence of circadian rhythm in maternal plasma estriol at term might suggest an additional positive stimulus to fetal adrenal function. The existence of patterns in maternal estriol concentrations must be taken into account in the use of sequential measurements of this hormone during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy.

N2  - The relative effects and consequences of split doses of exogenous insulin therapy (two thirds before breakfast and one third before the evening meal) on excursions and diurnal rhythm of circulating glucose during the 24-hour 'metabolic clock' were examined. A longitudinal study in pregnant women with maturity-onset diabetes (N = 7) with substantial endogenous insulin secretion and juvenile onset diabetes (N = 6) with no measurable endogenous insulin secretion (judged by C-peptide measurement) was compared with identical studies performed in nondiabetic pregnant control subjects (N = 6). Plasma glucose levels determined at hourly intervals throughout the 24-hour meal-activity-sleep cycles revealed marked excursions of plasma glucose values with exaggerated hyperglycemia during the day hours and relative hypoglycemia at night in both types of diabetic pregnancies as compared to normal control pregnancies. The magnitude of glucose excursion was surprisingly large relative to the degree of increase in the mean 24-hour glucose levels and mean fasting blood glucose values. A striking disparity in the amount of exogenous insulin required to maintain glucose levels and diurnal rhythm toward the normal range in pregnant diabetic patients from second to the third trimester was observed. The degree of exogenous insulin increment imposed by pregnancy (from the second to third trimester) in juvenile-onset diabetes was relatively small (38%) and comparable to the increase in endogenous insulin (32%) found in nondiabetic pregnancies. In marked contrast, among patients with maturity-onset diabetes, in whom substantial endogenous insulin secretion was present, the corresponding increment in exogenous insulin was surprisingly large (98%) without a proportional reduction in 24-hour integrated glucose values. These findings indicate that the effects and consequences of exogenous insulin therapy between maturity-onset diabetes and juvenile-onset diabetes during pregnancy are clearly different. Our data further suggest that peripheral insulin resistance constitutes the major factor accounting for the persistence of hyperglycemia in maturity-onset diabetes. Although the mechanism by which the exaggeration of insulin resistance in maturity-onset diabetes with superimposed pregnancy remains unclear, there are at least three additive contributing events to consider: the inherent defect of insulin resistance in this type of diabetes, the pregnancy-induced insulin resistance, and the reduction in number or affinity of insulin receptors in target tissues occasioned by excessive exogenous insulin treatment.

N2  - A longitudinal study to quantitate the progressive effects of the second and third trimesters of normal pregnancy on the levels of plasma glucose, immunoreactive insulin (IRI), and C-peptide (C-P) at hourly intervals throughout the 24-hour 'metabolic clock' was made. Identical studies were conducted in each subject at 6 to 11 weeks post partum and these data were used as nonpregnant control values. Data analyses were made to determine the role of meal-activity-sleep cycles as physiologic modifiers. A diurnal rhythm of plasma glucose, IRI, and C-P was demonstrated in all study periods. During meals anabolic values of plasma glucose (increments above the 24-hour mean) in response to meal intake were remarkably small, ranging between 30 and 35 mg/100 ml in the postpartum state, and were not significantly modified by pregnancy. The corresponding IRI levels were similarly small with a mean increase on only 31% in pregnancy. However, during the third but not the second trimester of pregnancy, the peak anabolic values for both plasma glucose and IRI were significantly (p < 0.05) increased and consequently the 2-hour postprandial glucose and IRI levels were significantly elevated after meal ingestion. When values were compared with those of the postpartum state, there was a progressive increase in the degree of catabolic excursion (decrease from 24-hour mean) of plasma glucose during sleeping hours from the second to third trimester of pregnancy. This resulted in a state or relative hypoglycemia, with significantly reduced fasting (8 A.M.) plasma glucose and 24-hour integrated glucose levels. This relative nocturnal hypoglycemia was associated with synchronous IRI values but without concomitant reduction of absolute IRI levels. Consequently, the fasting, premeal, and 24-hour IRI/glucose ratios were increased. Thus, basal insulin secretion is significantly augmented relative to levels of plasma glucose, but a quantitative increase in insulin secretion following food intake is relatively small during pregnancy. These observations together with the finding of a marked diurnal rhythm of plasma glucose and relative nocturnal hypoglycemia provide important insights for the formulation of guidelines for the timing, amount, and mode of delivery of exogenous insulin necessary for the management of diabetic patients during pregnancy.

N2  - Maternal plasma levels of pregnancy specific beta 1 glycoprotein (PSBG) in 166 normal and 169 toxemic pregnancies were measured by radioimmunoassay in the third trimester. Individual PSBG levels were studied in 16 women during weeks 7 through 39 of normal pregnancy. The levels were found to increase as pregnancy progressed. During the third trimester neither normal nor toxemic pregnancies showed any circadian rhythm in PSBG levels. In toxemic pregnancies low PSBG values were seen mainly in cases with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Plasma PSBG concentrations at weeks 39-40 in toxemic patients correlated positively with placental weight. No such correlation was found in normal or toxemic pregnancies at 37-38 weeks or in either group between PSBG level and infant birth weight, birth length, or Apgar score. In toxemic pregnancies with low PSBG values during the last trimester, birth weights were somewhat lower than in those with normal levels. Thus, low levels of maternal plasma PSBG may reflect IUGR, but will be of little value for assessment of fetal condition at birth.

N2  - The influence of the herbicide balagrin on the maternal organism and fetus was experimentally studied on 60 pregnant albino rats of Wistar line. The preparation was given orally throughout the entire gestation period in daily doses of 1/10 - 110 mg/kg, 1/20 - 55 mg/kg and 1/50 - 22 mg/kg of LD50 - 1100 mg/kg. The detoxifying function was studied by the duration of hexabarbital sleep, the excretory function, by the cholic acid content in the bile, and the enzymatic function, by the dehydrogenase activities: LDH, MDH, IDH, GL-6-PDH in the liver of pregnant animals and the fetus, marked toxic effect on the maternal and fetal organism was demonstrable at all balagrin application levels by the liver function disturbances.

N2  - Sleep-awake state distribution during feed intervals over a 24-hour period on the thrid day of life was investigated by means of a continuous non-intrusive bassinet sleep monitor. 31 infants were studied: 14 born to mothers who drank heavily throughout pregnancy (group A), eight whose mothers modified their heavy drinking (group B) and nine whose mothers never were heavy drinkers (group C). Over the 24-hour period, group A infants slept less than those in group B. In comparison with group C, group A infants had a larger proportion of quiet sleep episodes interrupted by awake or unclassified epochs, and were more restless, with more frequent major body movements. These observations suggest that heavy maternal consumption of alcohol, when continued throughout pregnancy, is associated with a disturbance of sleep-awake state distribution. Successful therapy of heavy drinking during pregnancy may improve the physiological competence of the newborn to regulate sleep-awake states and facilitate interaction between mother and infant.

N2  - The action of the diaphragm in inspiration is to decrease intrathoracic pressure and raise abdominal pressure, which elevates the rib cage. In the supine position, the rise in abdominal pressure is smaller because of the lack of abdominal muscle tone. In premature infants the inward pull of the diaphragm on the very compliant ribs causes inward movement on inspiration (i.e. distortion) which is exacerbated by the lack of intercostal muscle activity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, their predominant state. We raised abdominal pressure by means of an inflatable cuff in 12 newborn infants (gestation 28 to 40 weeks) to try to improve inspiratory coupling of the rib cage and diaphragm. There was no significant change in minute ventilation, indicating no ventilatory impairment. In all studies in which there was distortion, abdominal loading produced a reduction or abolition of distortion (P<.01). Abdominal loading may be useful in reducing diaphragmatic activity in premature infants.

N2  - In order to provide normative values of heart and respiratory rate and variability in relation to gestation and sleep states, 32 neonates who were free from cardiopulmonary disease were studied during the 1st-6th day of life. The infants were grouped as follows: group A, 9 infants with gestational ages of 27-33 wk; groups B, 14 infants with gestational ages of 34-36 wk; and group C, 9 infants with gestational ages of 37-40 wk. Recordings and observations were made during a 1-hr postprandial nap. During active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS), heart rate, short-term and long-term variability of the heart rate, respiratory rate, variability of the respiratory rate and apnea density were measured. Both the long- and short-term heart rate variability was less in preterm infants (group A) than the less immature or full term infants (groups B and C, P<.01). Breath-to-breath respiratory variability was not significantly affected by gestational age, whereas percent duration of apnea was less in full term (group C) than the preterm groups of infants during quiet sleep (group A and B, P<0.05). There was no significant difference between baseline heart rate, short-term heart rate variability, and respiratory rate during AS and QS states at any given gestational age. Long-term variations in heart rate, breath-to-breath respiratory variability,and percent duration of apnea were significantly less in QS in comparison to AS at each gestational age group (P<0.01). Systematic monitoring of newborn infants by the techniques presented in this report would further define normal cardiorespiratory functions in relation to maturity and sleep states. Application of these techniques to the study of the distressed newborn should provide an early indication of morbidity and recovery from disease.

N2  - During the last 3 to 4 mth of their pregnancies, six healthy mothers provided a daily record of their own activity together with the amount of fetal movement. Fetal movement increased throughout most of the daytime to reach a peak in the evening. The mothers detected most movement when they were lying, less when they were sitting and least when they were standing. Later in the day the mothers were less likely to be standing and more likely to be sitting; when fetal movement was measured with the mother in the sitting posture, more movement occurred as the day progressed. Mealtimes did not have any effect upon movement. Some implications of these findings, both for the assessment of fetal well-being and for theories of the development of circadian rhythms in the infant, are discussed.

N2  - The spontaneous sleep-waking behaviour of a male infant, normal with respect to pregnancy, delivery and Apgar score, was observed continuously from birth till the first four months of life. Additionally sleep stages were registered polygraphically during several weeks. The infant was allowed to sleep and awake according to his own schedule. It could be demonstrated that the spontaneous sleep-waking behaviour was mainly driven by 3 endogenous rhythms: The Basic rest activity cycle with a period of about 50 minutes, a 4-hour cycle already established during the first 2 weeks of life and a circadian rhythm which developed during the second month of life. So far the presented results support earlier studies of Kleitman and Engelmann, Sterman and Hoppenbrouwers, Hellbrugge etc. the present study, however, gives further evidence, that these rhythms do not run independently, but constitute a system of interacting oscillators.

N2  - In order to examine the relationship between circadian rhythms in different steroids, cortisol (F), estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3) were measured by radioimmunoassay in maternal venous plasma taken at 30 to 60-minute intervals over 24 hours and fell significantly to its lowest weeks' gestation. Maternal F was maximal at 0730 hours and fell significantly to its lowest concentration at 0230 hours. Maternal E3 was lowest between 1000 and 1130 hours and rose significantly to maximal values between 2230 and 0030 hours. Maternal E1 was maximal between 1000 and 1130 hours and showed a significant decrease to reach its lowest concentration at 0430 to 0630 hours. No significant circadian change was measured in uncorrected concentrations of E2. We conclude that there is an inverse relationship between maternal F and E3, which would be consistent with a maternal effect on fetal adrenal function, and the existence of circadian rhythms in F, E1, E2, and E3 must be taken into account in clinical investigations of these hormones during pregnancy.

N2  - The present study concerns the diurnal variations of free plasma oestriol and their relationship to maternal plasma cortisol in late human pregnancy. Four pregnant women volunteered for the study. According to the halflife time oestriol blood was drawn at intervals of 30 and 60 minutes, respectively, over a period of 24 hours. Free oestriol was measured by radioimmunoassay and cortisol was quantitated by a protein binding method. All patients exhibited a circadian rhythm for free oestriol with higher values in the evening and early night (14.4 ± 3.7 ng/ml) than in the morning (11.3 ± 2.4 mg/ml, P < 0.001). The course of oestriol followed plasma cortisol in a significant negative correlation (r = 0.566, P < 0.001). During the period of low cortisol concentration oestriol levels demonstrated the phenomenon of episodic secretion. The results suggest that the maternal adrenals predominantly regulate the circadian rhythm of free oestriol by a negative feed-back on the foetal hypothalamus.
