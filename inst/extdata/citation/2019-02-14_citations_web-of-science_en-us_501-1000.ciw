AB Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is an often-overlooked diagnosis, more prevalent in the obese population. Screening method accuracy, uptake and hence diagnosis is variable. There is limited data available regarding the obese pregnant population; however, many studies highlight potential risks of apnoeic episodes to mother and foetus, including hypertension, diabetes and preeclampsia. A total of 162 women with a body mass index (BMI) >= 35 were recruited from a tertiary referral hospital in the northwest of England. They were invited to attend three research antenatal clinics, completing an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire at each visit. A monitor measuring the apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) was offered at the second visit. Data taken from consent forms, hospital notes and hospital computer records were collated and anonymized prior to statistical analysis. A total of 12.1% of women had an ESS score of >10, suggesting possible OSA. Rates increased throughout pregnancy, although unfortunately, the attrition rate was high; 29.0% of women used the RUSleeping (RUS) meter, and only one (2.1%) met pre-specified criteria for OSA (AHI >= 15). This individual had OSA categorized as severe and underwent investigations for preeclampsia, eventually delivering by emergency caesarean section due to foetal distress. The accuracy of the ESS questionnaire, particularly the RUS monitor, to screen for OSA in the pregnant population remains unclear. Further research on a larger sample size using more user-friendly technology to confidently measure AHI would be beneficial. There are currently no guidelines regarding screening for OSA in the obese pregnant population, yet risks to both mother and foetus are well researched.

AB Importance: Superobesity, defined as body mass index 50 kg/m(2) or greater, is the fastest-growing obesity group in the United States. Currently, 2% of pregnant women in the United States are superobese, and 50% will deliver via cesarean delivery.
   Objective: To review evidence of perioperative care during cesarean delivery among superobese women. Evidence Acquisition: We performed an evidence-based review of maternal and neonatal risks of cesarean delivery and of intraoperative management and immediate postpartum care of superobese pregnant women. We also reviewed bariatric and general literature surgery on perioperative care of superobese patients.
   Results: There is limited information to direct evidence-based care of superobese women who undergo cesarean delivery. Superobese women have a 30% to 50% risk of wound complications, a 20% risk of neonatal intensive care unit admission, and a 1% to 2% risk of maternal intensive care unit admission. Preoperative discussion with superobese women should include a review of maternal and fetal risks associated with cesarean delivery, as well as operative options including skin incision. Preoperative cefazolin with a 3-g dose, chlorhexidine skin preparation, and availability of adequate personnel for patient transfers are important evidence-directed approaches to reducing maternal and personnel morbidity. Postoperatively, early ambulation and chemical prophylaxis are reasonable, although there is a lack of evidence as to whether these measures prevent thromboembolic complications.
   Conclusions and Relevance: Superobese women are at increased risk of cesarean delivery and resultant complications. Most evidence-directed recommendations for perioperative care are extrapolated from studies of obese women undergoing bariatric surgery. As the prevalence of reproductive-age women with superobesity increases, studies directed at this high-risk population are urgently need.
   Target Audience: Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians
   Learning Objectives: After completing this activity, the learner should be better able to describe maternal and neonatal risks of cesarean delivery among superobese women, describe preoperative considerations of cesarean delivery among superobese women, and recall evidence-based recommendations for intraoperative and postoperative management of cesarean delivery among superobese women.

AB Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains the leading cause of postneonatal mortality in the United States, despite reduction in rates of more than 50% since the initiation of the "Back to Sleep" (now called "Safe to Sleep") campaign in 1994. In recent years, the rate of decline in SIDS deaths has plateaued, even with the ongoing educational efforts that promote safe sleep and other risk reduction measures. The 2016 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for reducing the risk of SIDS focus heavily on sleep practices, bedding, and location, but also include factors that often receive less attention (ie, prenatal care, maternal smoking, alcohol and drug use, and childhood vaccinations). This review describes these factors that are less often addressed and identifies interventions that have resulted in positive behavioral changes that not only benefit infants, but also promote the health and well-being of their mothers.

AB Objective: Sleep during pregnancy involves a physiological challenge to provide sufficient gas exchange to the fetus. Enhanced ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia may protect from deficient gas exchange, but sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) may predispose to adverse events. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep and breathing in healthy pregnant women compared to non-pregnant controls, with a focus on CO2 changes and upper-airway flow limitation.
   Methods: Healthy women in the third trimester and healthy non-pregnant women with normal body mass index (BMI) were recruited for polysomnography. Conventional analysis of sleep and breathing was performed. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO2) was determined for each sleep stage. Flow-limitation was analyzed using the flattening index and TcCO2 values were recorded for every inspiration.
   Results: Eighteen pregnant women and 12 controls were studied. Pregnancy was associated with shorter sleep duration and more superficial sleep. Apnea-hypopnea index, arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation, flow-limitation, snoring or periodic leg movements were similar in the two groups. Mean SaO(2) and minimum SaO(2) were lower and average heart rate was higher in the pregnant group. TcCO2 levels did not differ between groups but variance of TcCO2 was smaller in pregnant women during non-rapid eye movement (NREM). TcCO2 profiles showed transient TcCO2 peaks, which seem specific to pregnancy.
   Conclusions: Healthy pregnancy does not predispose to SDB. Enhanced ventilatory control manifests as narrowing threshold of TcCO2 between wakefulness and sleep. Pregnant women have a tendency for rapid CO2 increases during sleep which might have harmful consequences if not properly compensated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To determine GHB levels in breast milk of women taking sodium oxybate (Xyrem) for treatment of narcolepsy and cataplexy.
   Methods: Two women with narcolepsy and cataplexy treated with sodium oxybate before pregnancy collected breast milk for analysis of GHB concentration after resuming sodium oxybate postpartum. One woman collected samples across two consecutive nights (doses: 3.0 gm and 4.5 gm twice per night) five months after delivering her first child; the other collected samples on three separate days (doses: 2.25 gm and 3.0 gm twice per night) nine months after the births of her first two children. GHB concentration was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
   Results: Milk GHB levels before sodium oxybate ranged from 5.81 to 7.60 mu M. Levels were 2-4 times higher four hours after the first sodium oxybate dose (10.44-23.58 mu M) and 35 times higher four hours after the second dose (ie, eight hours after first dose; 14.60-34.01 mu M). GHB levels returned to endogenous levels 6-10 h following the second dose, however variability was observed between patients and pregnancies. Higher breast milk GHB levels were observed with higher doses for both patients.
   Conclusions: Sodium oxybate is transmitted to breast milk. Despite its short half-life, GHB concentrations remained two-to-five times higher than endogenous levels four hours after both nighttime doses. To avoid excess GHB exposure, breastfeeding mothers who take sodium oxybate should consider expressing and discarding their morning milk. Future work should examine milk GHB levels after chronic sodium oxybate and determine whether levels change as milk composition changes across the postpartum period. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

SO PNEUMOLOGIE

DT Article
AB Sleep related breathing disorders include central sleep apnea (CSA), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), sleep-related hypoventilation, and sleep-related hypoxia. These disorders are frequent and growing in clinical relevance. The related chapter of the S3 guideline "Non-restorative sleep/Sleep disorders", published by the German Sleep Society (DGSM), has recently been updated in November 2016. Epidemiology, diagnostics, therapeutic procedures, and classification of sleep related disorders have been revised. Concerning epidemiology, a considerably higher mortality rate among pregnant women with OSA has been emphasized. With regards to diagnostics, the authors point out that respiratory polygraphy may be sufficient in diagnosing OSA, if a typical clinical condition is given. For CSA, recommendations were changed to diagnose CSA with low apnea rates present. Significant changes for treating CSA in patients with left ventricular dysfunction have been introduced. In addition, there is now to be differentiated between sleep-related hypoventilation and sleep-related hypoxaemia. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is discussed in more detail. This article sums up and comments on the published changes.

AB Background: Available evidence from cross-sectional studies suggests that childhood maltreatment may be associated with a range of sleep disorders. However, these studies have not controlled for potential individual-, familial-and environmental-level confounders.
   Aim: To determine the association between childhood maltreatment and lower sleep quality after adjusting for potential confounders.
   Methods: Data for the present study were obtained from a pre-birth cohort study of 3778 young adults (52.6% female) of the Mater Hospital-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy follow up at a mean age of 20.6 years. The Mater Hospital-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy is a prospective Australian pre-birth cohort study of mothers consecutively recruited during their first obstetric clinic visit at Brisbane's Mater Hospital in 1981-1983. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at the 21-year follow up. We linked this dataset to agency-recorded substantiated cases of childhood maltreatment. A series of separate logistic regression models was used to test whether childhood maltreatment predicted lower sleep quality after adjustment for selected confounders.
   Results: Substantiated physical abuse significantly predicted lower sleep quality in males. Single and multiple forms of childhood maltreatment, including age of maltreatment and number of substantiations, did not predict lower sleep quality in either gender in both crude and adjusted models. Not being married, living in a residential problem area, cigarette smoking and internalising were significantly associated with lower sleep quality in a fully adjusted model for the male-female combined sample.
   Conclusions: Childhood maltreatment does not appear to predict young adult poor sleep quality, with the exception of physical abuse for males. While childhood maltreatment has been found to predict a range of mental health problems, childhood maltreatment does not appear to predict sleep problems occurring in young adults. Poor sleep quality was accounted for by concurrent social disadvantage, cigarette smoking and internalising.

AB Day-night cycled light improves health outcomes in preterm infants, yet the best time to institute cycled light is unclear. The hypothesis of this study was that extremely preterm infants receiving early cycled light would have better health and developmental outcomes than infants receiving late cycled light. Infants born at <= 28 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to early cycled light (ECL) starting at 28 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA] or late cycled light (LCL), starting at 36 weeks PMA. Daylight was 200-600 lux and night was 5-30 lux. Primary outcomes were weight over time and length of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were hospital costs, sleep development, and neurodevelopment at 9, 18, and 24 months corrected age. Of 121 infants randomized, 118 were included in analysis. Weight gain in the two groups did not differ significantly but increased across time in both groups. In PMA weeks 36-44, the mean weight gain was 193.8 grams in the ECL group compared to 176.3 grams in the LCL group. Effect sizes for weight were Cohen d = 0.26 and 0.36 for 36 and 44 weeks PMA. Infants in the ECL group went home an average of 5.5 days earlier than the LCL group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were no group differences on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although statistically non-significant, clinically important differences of improved weight gain and decreased hospital stay were observed with ECL. The small observed effect sizes on weight during hospitalization should be considered in future cycled light research with extremely preterm infants. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   METAANALYSIS
AB The growing prevalence of childhood obesity has become a serious health problem over the past decades. As the immune system is greatly affected by excess weight, in this review of reviews, we discuss the findings of review articles about the relationship between childhood/maternal obesity and children's immune system. We searched English-language articles in PubMed, Scopus, ISI Thomson Reuters, and Google Scholar databases. All relevant reviews, either systematic or narrative, were retrieved. Then their quality was assessed by using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews and International Narrative Systematic Assessment tools, respectively. In the final step, 26 reviews were included. Our review suggests that childhood obesity is associated with extensive changes in the serum levels of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and proteins, as well as the number of immune cells and their behavior. Therefore, it might cause or exacerbate diseases such as asthma, allergy, atopic dermatitis (AD), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Moreover, childhood obesity may reduce the immune system responsiveness to vaccines and microorganisms. Furthermore, studies suggest that maternal obesity increases the risk of asthma in offspring. Future studies are needed to determine different associations of childhood obesity with allergy, atophic dermatitis, and autoimmune diseases.

AB During normal pregnancy, the mechanism by which the fetus escapes immunological rejection by the maternal womb remains elusive. Given the biological complexities, the immunological mechanism is unlikely to be simply an allograft response in acceptance or rejection of the early pregnancy. Circadian clock responsible for the mammalian circadian rhythm is an endogenously generated rhythm associated with almost all physiological processes including reproduction. There is now growing evidence to suggest that the circadian clocks are intricately linked to the immune system and pregnancy. When perturbed, the role of immune cells can be affected on maintaining the enriched vascular system needed for placentation. This alteration can be triggered by the irregular production of maternal and placental melatonin. Hence, the role of circadian rhythm modulators such as melatonin offers intriguing opportunities for therapy. In this review, we evaluate the complex interaction between the circadian clock and melatonin within the immune system and their roles in the circadian regulation and maintenance of normal pregnancy.

AB The consequences of childhood maltreatment are profound and long lasting. Not only does the victim of abuse suffer as a child, but there is mounting evidence that a history of maltreatment places the next generation at risk for significant psychopathology. Research identifies postnatal factors as affecting this intergenerational transmission of trauma. However, emerging evidence suggests that part of this risk may be transmitted before birth, passed on via abuse-related alterations in the in utero environment that are as yet largely unidentified. To date, no study has directly assessed the influence of pregnant women's abuse history on fetal neurobehavioral development, nor considered trauma-associated poor sleep quality as a mediator reflecting established physiological dysregulation. Using data from 262 pregnant adolescents (ages 14-19), a population at elevated risk for childhood maltreatment, the current study examined maternal emotional abuse history and sleep quality in relation to third-trimester fetal resting heart rate variability, an index of parasympathetic nervous system functioning. The results indicate that maternal emotional abuse history is indirectly associated with lower fetal heart rate variability via abuse-related sleep disturbances. These data demonstrate an association between maternal abuse histories and fetal development, showing that at least part of the intergenerational transmission of risk occurs during pregnancy.

AB Objective Pregnant women often suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD symptoms are known to influence the quality of life; however, there is a lack of data in pregnant women. The aim of this study was to establish the impact of GERD symptoms on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during pregnancy.
   Participants and methods A prospective longitudinal cohort study to investigate the impact of GERD symptoms on the HRQOL was carried out in 510 pregnant women and 330 nonpregnant women as controls. Two validated questionnaires, the Reflux Disease Questionnaire and the Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia Questionnaire, were used.
   Results The study showed a significant negative impact on HRQOL in pregnant women with GERD symptoms. All five areas, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, vitality, food/drink problems, and physical/social functioning, were significantly reduced, but the most significant impact was on sleep (Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia Questionnaire score - 35%). Overall, quality of life in women with GERD worsened throughout pregnancy.
   Conclusion GERD is frequently seen in pregnant women and has a negative impact on HRQOL, especially in late pregnancy. Therefore, there is a need for adequate therapy of GERD in pregnant women and HRQOL could be an adequate monitoring tool in this population. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB The organization of functional brain networks changes across human lifespan. The present study analyzed functional brain networks in healthy full-term infants (N = 139) within 1-6 days from birth by measuring neural synchrony in EEG recordings during quiet sleep. Large-scale phase synchronization was measured in six frequency bands with the Phase Lag Index. Macroscopic network organization characteristics were quantified by constructing unweighted minimum spanning tree graphs. The cortical networks in early infancy were found to be significantly more hierarchical and had a more cost-efficient organization compared with MST of random control networks, more so in the theta and alpha than in other frequency bands. Frontal and parietal sites acted as the main hubs of these networks, the topological characteristics of which were associated with gestation age (GA). This suggests that individual differences in network topology are related to cortical maturation during the prenatal period, when functional networks shift from strictly centralized toward segregated configurations.

AB Objective. The study of electroencephalographic (EEG) bursts in preterm infants provides valuable information about maturation or prognostication after perinatal asphyxia. Over the last two decades, a number of works proposed algorithms to automatically detect EEG bursts in preterm infants, but they were designed for populations under 35 weeks of post menstrual age (PMA). However, as the brain activity evolves rapidly during postnatal life, these solutions might be under-performing with increasing PMA. In this work we focused on preterm infants reaching term ages (PMA. 36 weeks) using multi-feature classification on a single EEG channel. Approach. Five EEG burst detectors relying on different machine learning approaches were compared: logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machines (SVM) and thresholding (Th). Classifiers were trained by visually labeled EEG recordings from 14 very preterm infants (born after 28 weeks of gestation) with 36-41 weeks PMA. Main results. The most performing classifiers reached about 95% accuracy (kNN, SVM and LR) whereas Th obtained 84%. Compared to human-automatic agreements, LR provided the highest scores (Cohen's kappa = 0.71) using only three EEG features. Applying this classifier in an unlabeled database of 21 infants. 36 weeks PMA, we found that long EEG bursts and short inter-burst periods are characteristic of infants with the highest PMA and weights. Significance. In view of these results, LR-based burst detection could be a suitable tool to study maturation in monitoring or portable devices using a single EEG channel.

AB Background
   During pregnancy, many women experience sleep problems and anxiety that require treatment. The long-term safety for the child of maternal benzodiazepine (BZD) and z-hypnotic use during pregnancy remains controversial.
   Method
   We conducted a cohort and a sibling control study using data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Data on use of BZD and z-hypnotics, internalizing and externalizing outcomes, and covariates were collected from mothers at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and when children were 0.5, 1.5, and 3 years of age. The total sample consisted of 71,996 children (19,297 siblings) at 1.5 years and 55,081 children (13,779 siblings) at 3 years. Shortterm use was defined as use in one pregnancy period only. Long-term use was defined as use in two or more pregnancy periods. Linear full cohort random-effect and sibling-matched fixed-effect regression models were used to compare internalizing and externalizing behavior in children prenatally exposed compared to those unexposed in the full cohort of pregnancies accounting for family clusters, as well as within sibling clusters comparing pregnancies with discordant exposures. Propensity score (PS) adjustment included variables on indication for use (sleep problems, symptoms of anxiety and depression) and other potential confounding factors.
   Results
   Long-term prenatal exposure to BZD or z-hypnotics was associated with increased internalizing behavior in crude cohort analyses and at age 1.5 years after PS adjustment in siblingmatched fixed-effect models [beta 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.17-0.95]. Analyses on specific drug groups showed that prenatal exposure to BZD-anxiolytics was associated with increased internalizing problems at both 1.5 years [beta 0.25, 0.01-0.49] and 3 years [beta 0.26, 0.002-0.52] while exposure to z-hypnotics was not associated with any adverse outcomes after adjustment.
   Conclusion
   The findings suggest a moderate association between BZD-anxiolytic exposure and child internalizing problems that is not likely due to stable familial confounding factors.

AB Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep occurs throughout a relatively large proportion of early development, and normal REM activity appears to be required for healthy brain development. The eye movements (EMs) observed during REM sleep are the most distinctive characteristics of this state. EMs are used as an index of neurological function postnatally, but no specific indices of EM activity exist for fetuses. We aimed to identify and characterize EM activity, particularly EM bursts suggestive of REM periods, in fetuses with a gestational age between 24 and 39 weeks. This cross- sectional study included 84 normal singleton pregnancies. Fetal EMs were monitored using real- time ultrasonography for 60 min and recorded as videos. The videos were manually converted into a time series of EM events, which were then analyzed by piecewise linear regression for various EM characteristics, including EM density, EM burst density, density of EMs in EM bursts, and continuous EM burst time. Two critical points for EM density, EM burst density, and density of EMs in EM bursts were evident at gestation weeks 28 - 29 and 36 - 37. Overall EM activity in human fetuses increased until 28 - 29 weeks of gestation, then again from 36 - 37 to 38 - 39 weeks of gestation. These findings may be useful for creating indices of fetal neurological function for prognostic purposes.

AB Objectives: Good maternal health and fetal development require sufficient and good quality of sleep during pregnancy. This study investigated sleep duration and quality in pregnant women, assessing factors with possibly influence on sleep. Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on pregnant women between June and August in 2015 in 16 hospitals in five provinces in China. A total of 2345 pregnant women aged 18 years and older were surveyed. Insufficient sleeping duration was defined as sleeping of less than 7 h per day. Excessive sleep duration was defined as sleeping of more than 9 h per day. Results: A total of 561 (23.9%) participants reported insufficient sleeping duration, whereas 485 (20.9%) claimed excessive sleep duration. A total of 358 (15.2%) of pregnant women reported problems regarding sleep quality. Compared to pregnant women with sufficient sleeping duration, those with insufficient sleeping duration were prone to have poor sleep quality, whereas those with excessive sleeping duration featured low possibility of poor sleep quality. High-risk groups of insufficient sleep duration include women of Han nationality, with siblings, in their first trimester of pregnancy, receiving care in low-capacity/quality hospital settings, and with daily or 1-3 days of secondhand smoke exposure. High-risk groups of excessive sleep duration include women living in rural areas, unemployed, in their third trimester of pregnancy, and receiving care in medium-capacity/quality hospital settings. High-risk groups of poor sleep quality include women of non-Han nationality, low income level, in their third trimester of pregnancy, and with insufficient sleep duration. Conclusions: Insufficient/excessive sleep duration and poor sleep quality commonly occur during pregnancy in China. Findings provide a better understanding of the influencing factors of insufficient/excessive sleep duration and poor quality of sleep. These findings have some implications for future interventions on sleep among pregnant women.

AB Background: Synchrony between daily feeding-fasting signals and circadian rhythms has been shown to improve metabolic health in animals and adult humans, but the potential programming effect on fetal growth is unknown.
   Objective: We examined the associations of the maternal night-fasting interval during pregnancy with offspring birth size and adiposity.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of mother-offspring dyads within the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort. For 384 mothers aged 30.8 +/- 4.8 y (mean +/- SD), the night-fasting interval at 26-28 wk of gestation was determined from a 3-d food diary based on the average of the fasting duration at night (1900-0659). Offspring birth weight, length, and head circumference were measured and converted to weight-for-gestational age (GA), length-for-GA, and head circumference-for-GA z scores, respectively, by using local customized percentile charts. The percentage of neonatal total body fat (TBF) was derived by using a validated prediction equation. Multivariable general linear models, stratified by child sex, were performed.
   Results: The mean +/- SD maternal night-fasting interval was 9.9 +/- 1.3 h. In infant girls, each 1-h increase in the maternal night-fasting interval was associated with a 0.22-SD (95% CI: 0.05-, 0.40-SD; P = 0.013) increase in birth head circumference-for-GA and a 0.84% (95% CI: 0.19%, 1.49%; P = 0.012) increase in TBF at birth, after adjustment for confounders. In infant boys, no associations were observed between the maternal night-fasting interval and birth size or TBF.
   Conclusions: An increased maternal night-fasting interval in the late second trimester of pregnancy is associated with increased birth head circumference and TBF in girls but not boys. Our findings are in accordance with previous observations that suggest that there are sex-specific responses in fetal brain growth and adiposity, and raise the possibility of the maternal night-fasting interval as an underlying influence.

AB Objective: To evaluate the frequency, severity, distress, and correlates of common and rare symptoms reported by nulliparous women during the last month of pregnancy.
   Design: Secondary cross-sectional analysis of data obtained in a larger randomized clinical trial.
   Setting: San Francisco Bay area.
   Participants: Nulliparous, ethnically diverse, predominantly low-income pregnant women 18 to 47 years of age (N = 151).
   Methods: Participants at or beyond 36 weeks gestation used the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) to provide self-reports of general symptom experience. Other symptom measures were also completed for comparison. Demographic characteristics, including gestational weight gain, were also collected. Gestational weight gain was categorized in relation to the Institute of Medicine's 2009 recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy.
   Results: Women endorsed an average of 10.6 +/- 5.6 symptoms on the MSAS. Prevalent symptoms (reported by at least half the sample) included lack of energy, pain, difficulty sleeping, worrying, irritability, drowsiness, shortness of breath, and nervousness. Among the women who reported these symptoms, relatively few described them as occurring with high frequency or severity or as causing much distress. One of the most prevalent symptoms (reported by 68% of women) was difficulty sleeping, which also had among the greatest ratings for frequency, severity, and distress. Although few maternal characteristics were associated with symptom experience, women who gained more weight than the Institute of Medicine's recommendation had worse MSAS total scores than women who gained the recommended amount or less.
   Conclusion: In nulliparas, symptom frequency, severity, and distress varied and were related to excessive gestational weight gain.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of diabetes that affects pregnant women. GDM tends to resolve after delivery, but has an impact on the health of the mother and her offspring. Considering the potential association between noise and diabetes and the susceptibility of the pregnant state to diabetogenesis, noise pollution may be associated with the risk of GDM; however, there is no evidence of the effect of noise pollution on GDM. In this study, we investigated the association between residential exposure to noise during the first trimester and incidence of GDM using the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHISNSC), a representative sample of South Koreans. We analyzed the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (2002-2013), a population-wide health insurance claim data. Study population was a total of 18 165 pregnant women. GDM was defined as ICD-10 code O244, and noise exposure levels were categorized as daytime (07:00-19:00) and nighttime (23:00-7:00). Other known risk factors for GDM were age, income, residential area, physical activity, smoking, drinking, blood sugar levels, and body mass index before getting pregnant. The study population included 18 165 pregnant women, of which 8.8% developed gestational diabetes. After adjustment, the adjusted OR (95% CI) for GDM associated with 1 dB increase in nighttime noise was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.05-1.10). Compared with the reference group (Quartile 1), the adjusted ORs for GDM in those exposed to the highest quartile of noise exposure (Quartile 4) was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.38-1.87) at nighttime noise. However, no significant association was observed between daytime noise exposure (07:00-19:00) and the incidence of GDM. We observed that the odds of gestational diabetes during the first trimester was 1.6 times higher for pregnant women exposed to elevated nighttime noise compared to similar women exposed to normal baseline noise levels in South Korea. Although this finding should be replicated, residential noise exposure at night may be a diabetogenic risk for pregnant women.

AB Maternal use of smoked tobacco during pregnancy causes significant morbidity and mortality in the human infant including alterations in autonomic control with increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome. We hypothesized that maternal snus (smokeless tobacco) use during pregnancy affects autonomic cardiac regulation in the infant, as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) and the low frequency and high frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio).
   A prospective observational study of 56 infants of women who used snus (n = 23) or cigarettes (n = 13) during pregnancy versus tobacco- and nicotine-free controls (n = 19). The nicotine dose was estimated by questionnaires at 4 timepoints pre- and post-natally. The infants' urine cotinine concentration and HRV during 2 hours of sleep were studied 1-2 months after birth.
   LF/HF ratio was higher in snus (mean 3.31; 95% CI 2.78-3.83) and smoke (3.51;2.54-4.47) compared to controls (2.15; 1.76-2.54, p = .002). Early prenatal nicotine exposure "without" any further exposure increased the LF/HF ratio (3.19; 2.55-3.84, p = .02). Continuous prenatal nicotine exposure "without" postnatal exposure was also associated with a residual increase in LF/HF ratio (4.40; 3.38-5.42, p < .001). There was no difference between infants exposed to smokeless versus smoked tobacco, suggesting a common constituent (nicotine) altering autonomic cardiac regulation.
   Infants to mothers who used snus during pregnancy showed lower vagal activity with an increased LF/HF ratio compared to controls, and similar to infants of smokers. Even early prenatal exposure to snus has a lasting impact on autonomic cardiac regulation suggesting a fetal "re-programing" of the developing autonomic nervous system.
   The results indicate that smokeless tobacco (Swedish snus) affects the developing autonomic nervous system during gestation. Even if exposure is interrupted during the first or second trimester, effects in autonomic cardiac regulation are seen in the 1-2 month-old infant. This underlines the importance of abstaining from all types of tobacco use during the whole pregnancy. Our findings may also have more general relevance to other routes by which nicotine can be delivered to a fetus and newborn.

AB Objectives To assess the associations of perceived financial satisfaction and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and depressive symptoms in an unselected pregnant population in early pregnancy. Methods 750 consecutive pregnant women attending the first communal ultrasound examination before gestational week 14 were invited to participate. Questionnaires assessing HRQoL (15D), depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Depression Scale, EPDS), medical, obstetric, and socioeconomic status were handed out. The participants were divided into three groups according to their satisfaction with their financial status, (unsatisfied, somewhat satisfied, and satisfied). Main outcome measures were 15D and EPDS-scores and dimensions of HRQoL. Results 325 (43,3%) questionnaires were returned. The mean 15D-score for HRQoL was 0,926 (SD 0,056). The financially unsatisfied women had lower HRQoL than women in more satisfied groups (0.906, 0.923 and 0.931, p = 0.012). The result remained significant, even after adjusting for age and education(p = 0.032). The unsatisfied women had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) (25.4, 24.4 and 23.2 kg/m(2), p for linearity = 0.002), were more often smokers, (13 vs. 4 and 3%, p = 0.029), and had experienced at least one abortion (18, 14 and 7%, p = 0.017). Dimensions of depression, distress and sleep explained the differences between the groups. 27% of unsatisfied women scored EPDS ae<yen>10 points suggesting increased risk of depression. Conclusions Financial satisfaction in early pregnancy associates with HRQoL and risk of perinatal depressive symptoms. Unsatisfied women more often have risk factors for unfavourable pregnancy outcomes which may influence the later health and wellbeing of the mother and child.

AB Community chemotherapy campaigns to reduce malaria transmission often exclude pregnant women due to safety concerns related to the drugs. However, pregnant women might represent an important source of human-to-mosquito infection due to frequent parasite carriage with higher densities of parasites (often detectable by microscopy), attractiveness to mosquitoes, and modified sleeping behaviour. Accumulating evidence of the safety of artemisinin-based combination therapies for the treatment of malaria during gestation suggests that malaria elimination programmes should reconsider this exclusion. Including pregnant women will increase intervention coverage and impact, and may thereby accelerate progress towards the desired endpoint (e.g., elimination) or increase the chances of success. Studies assessing infectiousness of pregnant women and gametocyte dynamics during different trimesters of pregnancy will be valuable to support the planning of community treatment campaigns.

AB Objective: To ascertain adult outcomes in 10 domains reflecting symptomatology (internalizing, externalizing, self-injury, substance use), attainment (education, employment), and impairment (health, social, driving, overall) as a function of both childhood diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and persistence of ADHD symptoms across time. Method: We prospectively followed 140 grade-school-aged girls with rigorously diagnosed childhood ADHD and 88 age- and ethnicity-matched comparison girls for 16 years. Outcome measures were obtained via self- and parent-report questionnaires, interviews, and objective tests. Results: Childhood AMID, whether it remitted or persisted, was a pernicious risk factor for a limited number of poor outcomes, including low educational attainment, unplanned pregnancy, body mass index (HMI), and clinician-rated impairment. Childhood ADHD that persisted over time, whether completely or partially, was associated with a number of additional detrimental outcomes in the externalizing, internalizing, self-injury, occupational, social, and overall impairment domains. Finally, in this all-female sample, ADIID was not associated with objective measures of employment, substance use, or driving outcomes. Conchtsions: We discuss the considerable impairments accruing from both childhood-limited and adult-persisting ADHD, with major implications for the health and well-being of females with this neurodevelopmental disorder.
   What is the public health significance of this article?
   Although a minority of girls no longer meet symptom criteria for ADIID in adulthood, they still show substantial educational underachievement over time, as well as increased body mass index and much greater likelihood of at least 1 unplanned pregnancy. Among girls, childhood ADHD that persists into adulthood is associated with these educational and health problems (increased body mass index and unplanned pregnancy) as well as substantially increased risk for internalizing problems (e.g., anxiety and depression), externalizing problems (e.g., aggression and defiance), self-injury, and occupational impairment. On average, however, girls with childhood ADHD are not at increased risk for later substance use problems, at least in the present sample.

AB Postpartum psychosis has long-lasting consequences for mother and child. Beside depression, sleep and eating disturbances, exhaustion, social withdrawal, and anxiety, postpartum depression can also interfere with normal maternal-infant bonding and adversely affect child development. Recent reports show that most affected pregnant women are hesitant about taking antidepressant drugs, with a high percentage discontinuing their use. Some authors suggest that the reluctance of pregnant women to take antidepressant drugs should encourage clinicians to discuss with their patients the use of psychological interventions or alternative forms of treatment. In this article, a case of severe postpartum depression, treated successfully with homeopathic therapy, is presented. Considering the high noncompliance of women suffering from postpartum depression with conventional antidepressant medication, research in safe complementary medical methods is justified. One of these methods should be homeopathy.

AB Introduction
   Placental histologic examination can assist in revealing the mechanism leading to preterm birth. Accumulating evidence suggests an association between intrauterine pathological processes, morbidity and mortality of premature infants, and their long term outcome. Neonatal brain activity is increasingly monitored in neonatal intensive care units by amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) and indices of background activity and sleep cycling patterns were correlated with long term outcome. We hypothesized an association between types of placental lesions and abnormal neonatal aEEG patterns.
   Objective
   To determine the association between the placental lesions observed in extreme preterm deliveries, and their neonatal aEEG patterns and survival.
   Patients and methods
   This prospective cohort study included extreme premature infants, who were born <= 28 weeks of gestation, their placentas were available for histologic examination, and had a continues aEEG, soon after birth)n = 34). Infants and maternal clinical data were collected. aEEG data was assessed for percentage of depressed daily activity in the first 3 days of life and for sleep cycling. Associations of placental histology with clinical findings and aEEG activity were explored using parametric and non-parametric statistics.
   Results
   Twenty two out of the 34 newborns survived to discharge. Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) or chorioamnionitis were associated with placental lesions consistent with fetal amniotic fluid infection (AFI) or maternal under perfusion (MUP) (P < 0.05). Lesions consistent with fetal response to AFI were associated with absence of SWC pattern during the 1st day of life. Fetal-vascular-thrombo-occlusive lesions of inflammatory type were negatively associated with depressed cerebral activity during the 1st day of life, and with aEEG cycling during the 2nd day of life (P<0.05). Placental lesions associated with MUP were associated with depressed neonatal cerebral activity during the first 3 days of life (P = 0.007).
   Conclusions
   Depressed neonatal aEEG patterns are associated with placental lesions consistent with maternal under perfusion, and amniotic fluid infection of fetal type, but not with fetal thrombo-oclusive vascular disease of inflammatory type. Our findings highlight the association between the intrauterine mechanisms leading to preterm parturition and subsequent depressed neonatal cerebral function early after birth, which eventually may put premature infants at risk for abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome.

AB Background: The Auckland Stillbirth study demonstrated a two-fold increased risk of late stillbirth for women who did not go to sleep on their left side. Two further studies have confirmed an increased risk of late stillbirth with supine sleep position. As sleep position is modifiable, we surveyed self-reported late pregnancy sleep position, knowledge about sleep position, and views about changing going-to-sleep position.
   Methods: Participants in this 2014 survey were pregnant women (n = 377) in their third trimester from South Auckland, New Zealand, a multi-ethnic and predominantly low socio-economic population. An ethnically-representative sample was obtained using random sampling. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with non-left sided going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy.
   Results: Respondents were 28 to 42 weeks' gestation. Reported going-to-sleep position in the last week was left side (30%), right side (22%), supine (3%), either side (39%) and other (6%). Two thirds (68%) reported they had received advice about sleep position. Non-left sleepers were asked if they would be able to change to their left side if it was better for their baby; 87% reported they would have little or no difficulty changing. Women who reported a non-left going-to-sleep position were more likely to be of Maori (aOR 2.64 95% CI 1.23-5.66) or Pacific (aOR 2.91 95% CI 1.46-5.78) ethnicity; had a lower body mass index (BMI) (aOR 0.93 95% CI 0.89-0.96); and were less likely to sleep on the left-hand side of the bed (aOR 3.29 95% CI 2.03-5.32).
   Conclusions: Maternal going-to-sleep position in the last week was side-lying in 91% of participants. The majority had received advice to sleep on their side or avoid supine sleep position. Sleeping on the left-hand side of the bed was associated with going-to-sleep on the left side. Most non-left sleepers reported their sleeping position could be modified to the left side suggesting a public health intervention about sleep position is likely to be feasible in other multi- ethnic communities.

AB Objective
   Our objective was to test the primary hypothesis that maternal non-left, in particular supine going-to-sleep position, would be a risk factor for late stillbirth (>= 28 weeks of gestation).
   Methods
   A multicentre case-control study was conducted in seven New Zealand health regions, between February 2012 and December 2015. Cases (n = 164) were women with singleton pregnancies and late stillbirth, without congenital abnormality. Controls (n = 569) were women with on-going singleton pregnancies, randomly selected and frequency matched for health region and gestation. The primary outcome was adjusted odds of late stillbirth associated with self-reported going-to-sleep position, on the last night. The last night was the night before the late stillbirth was thought to have occurred or the night before interview for controls. Going-to-sleep position on the last night was categorised as: supine, left-side, right-side, propped or restless. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for known confounders.
   Results
   Supine going-to-sleep position on the last night was associated with increased late stillbirth risk (adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 3.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74 to 7.78) with a population attributable risk of 9.4%. Other independent risk factors for late stillbirth (aOR, 95% CI) were: BMI (1.04, 1.01 to 1.08) per unit, maternal age >= 40 (2.88, 1.31 to 6.32), birth-weight < 10(th) customised centile (2.76, 1.59 to 4.80), and < 6 hours sleep on the last night (1.81, 1.14 to 2.88). The risk associated with supine-going-to-sleep position was greater for term (aOR 10.26, 3.00 to 35.04) than preterm stillbirths (aOR 3.12, 0.97 to 10.05).
   Conclusions
   Supine going-to-sleep position is associated with a 3.7 fold increase in overall late stillbirth risk, independent of other common risk factors. A public health campaign encouraging women not to go-to-sleep supine in the third trimester has potential to reduce late stillbirth by approximately 9%.

AB Background: Universal coverage of the targeted malaria-endemic areas with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is implemented as one of the key interventions for malaria control and elimination in Yemen. In 2013, through a mass campaign, LLINs were distributed to the targeted communities in Al Hudaydah governorate. This study aimed to assess the ownership of, access to, and use of LLINs. It also aimed to identify factors associated with not using LLINs in malaria-endemic areas of Al Hudaydah in the Tihama region, west of Yemen.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in four districts (Ad Durayhimi, Al Marawi'ah, Al Mansuriyah and Bayt Al Faqiah) in Al Hudaydah during February 2016. A total of 701 households were included in this study. Data on socio-demographic characteristics and availability of LLINs were collected by interview and observation. Four indicators for malaria prevention using LLINs; proportion of households with at least one LLIN, proportion of households with at least one LLIN for every two people, proportion of population with access to LLINs in the surveyed households and proportion of population who slept under LLINs the previous night of the survey were calculated as indicated by Roll Back Malaria Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group. Use to access ratio was assessed. Factors associated with not using LLINs among people with access were also investigated.
   Results: Of 701 households with 4900 de facto population, ownership of at least one LLIN was 90.6%, while 24.1% owned at least one for every two people during the survey in 2016. The overall proportion of people with access to LLINs was 51.5% (95% CI 50.1-52.9). Only 19.0% (95% CI 17.9-20.1) slept under LLINs the night before the survey and the overall use to access ratio was 0.37. The proportions of children under 5 years of age with access to and use of LLINs were 13.7 and 42.5%, respectively. On the other hand, the proportions of pregnant women with access to and use of LLINs were 16.4 and 20.0%, respectively. Multivariable analysis identified that people living in Al Mansuriyah district [ adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-8.01; P = 0.009)], having three or more damaged LLINs in the house (AOR = 2.76, 95% CI 1.79-4.25; P < 0.001), aged between 16 and 45 years old (AOR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.26-3.75; P = 0.005) or older (AOR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.09-4.29; P = 0.026) and living in huts (AOR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.09-2.32; P = 0.015) were significantly less likely to use LLINs.
   Conclusions: This study shows a low LLIN access rate among local communities targeted for universal LLIN coverage in Al Hudaydah, a malaria-endemic area of high transmission. This finding necessitates additional distribution channels following mass campaigns to maintain the universal coverage. Reduced use of LLINs among people with access in these communities together with the identified risks of non-use highlight the importance of conducting behaviour change communication campaigns to enhance using LLINs in areas with universal coverage.

TI The combination of bed sharing and maternal smoking leads to a greatly
   increased risk of sudden unexpected death in infancy: the New Zealand
   SUDI Nationwide Case Control Study
SO NEW ZEALAND MEDICAL JOURNAL

ID COT DEATH; SLEEPING POSITION; MORTALITY; PROGRAM
AB BACKGROUND: Despite a major reduction in overall infant mortality, sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) continues to be of concern in New Zealand, as the rate is high by international standards, and is even higher in indigenous Maori.
   AIM: To identify modifiable risk factors for SUDI.
   METHODS: A three-year (1 March 2012-28 February 2015) nationwide case-control study was conducted in New Zealand.
   RESULTS: There were 137 SUDI cases, giving a SUDI mortality rate of 0.76/1,000 live births. The rate for Maori was 1.41/1,000, Pacific 1.01/1,000 and non-Maori non-Pacific (predominantly European) 0.50/1,000. The parent(s) of 97% of the SUDI cases were interviewed. Six hundred and forty-nine controls were selected and 258 (40%) were interviewed. The two major risk factors for SUDI were: maternal smoking in pregnancy (adjusted OR=6.01, 95% CI=2.97, 12.15) and bed sharing (aOR=4.96, 95% CI=2.55, 9.64). There was a significant interaction (p=0.002) between bed sharing and antenatal maternal smoking. Infants exposed to both risk factors had a markedly increased risk of SUDI (aOR=32.8, 95% CI=11.2, 95.8) compared with infants not exposed to either risk factor. Infants not sharing the parental bedroom were also at increased risk of SUDI (aOR=2.77, 95% CI=1.45, 5.30). Just 21 cases over the three-year study were not exposed to smoking in pregnancy, bed sharing or front or side sleeping position.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that many of the risk factors that were identified in the original New Zealand Cot Death Study (1987-1989) are still relevant today. The combination of maternal smoking in pregnancy and bed sharing is extremely hazardous for infants. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the SUDI prevention messages are still applicable today and should be reinforced. SUDI mortality could be reduced to just seven p.a. in New Zealand (approximately one in 10,000 live births).

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a common neurological sensorimotor disorder in western countries, has gained more and more attention in Asian countries. The prevalence of RLS is higher in older people and females. RLS is most commonly related to iron deficiency, pregnancy and uremia. The RLS symptoms show a significant circadian rhythm and a close relationship to periodic limb movements (PLMs) in clinical observations, while the pathophysiological pathways are still unknown. The diagnostic criteria have been revised in 2012 to improve the validity of RLS diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested an important role of iron decrease of brain in RLS pathophysiology. Dopaminergic (DA) system dysfunction in A11 cell groups has been recognized long ago from clinical treatment and autopsy. Nowadays, it is believed that iron dysfunction can affect DA system from different pathways and opioids have a protective effect on DA system. Several susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms such as BTBD9 and MEIS1, which are thought to be involved in embryonic neuronal development, have been reported to be associated with RLS. Several pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment are discussed in this review. First-line treatments of RLS include DA agents and alpha 2 delta agonists. Augmentation is very common in long-term treatment of RLS which makes prevention and management of augmentation very important for RLS patients. A combination of different types of medication is effective in preventing and treating augmentation. The knowledge on RLS is still limited, the pathophysiology and better management of RLS remain to be discovered.

AB Introduction Sleep is important to promote optimal health and avoid negative health outcomes. Short-duration and low-quality sleep may be more common and more detrimental among women compared with men. Identifying the determinants of behaviour is one of the first steps in designing effective interventions. To our knowledge, no systematic review has identified the individual, social and environmental determinants of sleep among adult women.
   Methods and analysis Studies reporting data on adult women from 18 to 64 years of age will be included. On the basis of ecological models of health behaviour and sleep, the types of determinants that will be included in the review are individual (eg, demographic, psychological and behavioural), social (eg, family) and environmental (eg, physical environment and policies) determinants. Observational (cross-sectional and longitudinal) and experimental studies will be included. MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and Proquest Dissertations and Theses will be investigated. Data will be extracted independently by two reviewers using a standardised data extraction form. The quality of observational studies will be assessed using the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and CrossSectional Studies and the quality of experimental studies will be assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Study. If there is a sufficient number of studies reporting data on a similar determinant among a similar population (k>5), a meta-analysis of the results will be performed with a random-effects model. If between-study heterogeneity is high (I-2 = 75%), it will be investigated through sensitivity analyses and meta-regression.
   Ethics and dissemination Formal ethical approval is not required as no primary data will be collected. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. This review will provide valuable information to those interested in developing empirically based sleep interventions among women.

AB Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD) are the most common, yet under-diagnosed and undertreated complication of pregnancy, affecting up to 50% of pregnant and parenting teens. PMAD are a global health issue that can have devastating effects on the mental, physical, emotional, developmental health, and social life of the mother, infant, and family. Adolescents present with similar symptoms of PMAD as their adult counterparts, but also experience isolation from their peer group and lack of resources and coping strategies, as well as difficulty sleeping and lack of concentration and ability to focus. Nurses and nurse practitioners are in an ideal position to assess preexisting risk factors for PMAD. The current applied evidence-based article addresses the diagnosis of PMAD, provides a conceptual framework for understanding the intra- and interpersonal dynamics affecting teens with PMAD, and suggests a new screening tool to guide diagnosis. An easy to recall mnemonic for diagnosis and referral (SAIL AHEAD) is proposed. By using the SAIL AHEAD mnemonic, providers will impact adolescents' parenting success and resiliency, thereby enhancing their future success in life.

AB PURPOSE: To investigate hair cortisol concentration (HCC), a biochemical correlate of chronic psychological stress, and its relationship to the progression of keratoconus.
   METHODS: Eighty-six participants were included in this prospective observational study (32 patients with progressive keratoconus, 32 patients with stable keratoconus, and 22 healthy controls). Hair cortisol concentrations were determined from 3-cm hair strands collected near the scalp from patients and controls as an index of cumulative cortisol secretion during the 3-month period prior to hair sampling. In addition, self-reported chronic stress was assessed using the Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress screening scale.
   RESULTS: Patients with progressive keratoconus exhibited higher hair cortisol concentrations (mean value: 29.11 pg/mg; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.13 to 38.28) than patients with stable keratoconus (mean value: 15.88 pg/mg; 95% CI: 12.25 to 20.65; P = .007) and healthy controls (mean value: 16.98 pg/mg; 95% CI: 12.30 to 23.44; P = .049). There were no significant differences in hair cortisol concentrations between healthy controls and patients with stable keratoconus (P = .991). Group differences were not affected by relevant covariates (body mass index, age, or sex).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that increased hair cortisol concentration seems to be associated with the progression of keratoconus. There are a variety of causes of increased hair cortisol concentration.

AB Objective: Evaluate benefit and risk of low dose growth hormone treatment (GHT, 4.5 mg/m(2)/week) in very young children with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS).
   Design: Prospective longitudinal clinical intervention.
   Methods: We evaluated 31 infants (aged 2-12 months) and 42 toddlers (13-24 months) from the PWS-OZGROW database for height, weight and BMI using the World Health Organization standard deviation scores (SDSWHO) and PWS specific BMI (SDSPWS), bone age, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) levels and adverse events over 3 years of GHT.
   Results: At commencement of GHT infants had a lower BMI SDSWHO (-0.88 vs 0.40) than toddlers, while toddlers had a lower height SDSwHo (-1.44 vs - 2.09) (both P < 0.05). All increased height SDSWHO (2 year delta height infants +1.26 SDS, toddlers + 121 SDS), but infants normalised height sooner, achieving a height SDS of - 0.56 within 1 year, while toddlers achieved a height SDS of - 0.88 in two years. BMI SDSwHo increased, while BMI SDSPWS decreased (both P < 0.0001) and remained negative. The GHT response did not differ with gestation (pre-term 23%) or genetic subtype (deletion vs maternal uniparental disomy). Bone age advancement paralleled chronological age. All children had low serum IGF-I at baseline which increased, but remained within the age-based reference range during GHT (for 81% in first year). Four children had spinal curvature at baseline; two improved, two progressed to a brace and two developed an abnormal curve over the observation period. Mild to severe central and/or obstructive sleep apnoea were observed in 40% of children prior to GHT initiation; 11% commenced GHT on positive airway pressure (PAP), oxygen or both. Eight children ceased GHT due to onset or worsening of sleep apnoea: 2 infants in the first few months and 6 children after 6-24 months. Seven resumed GHT usually after adjusting PAP but five had adenotonsillectomy. One child ceased GHT temporarily due to respiratory illness. No other adverse events were reported. Two children substantially improved their breathing shortly after GHT initiation.
   Conclusion: Initiation of GHT in infants with 4.5 mg/m(2)/week was beneficial and comparable in terms of auxological response to a dose of 7 mg/m(2)/week. Regular monitoring pre and post GH initiation assisted in early detection of adverse events. IGF-I levels increased with the lower dose but not excessively, which may lower potential long-term risks.

AB (Pro)renin receptor ((P)RR) is a multi-functional molecule that is related to both the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and vacuolar H+-ATPase (v-ATPase), an ATP-dependent multi-subunit proton pump. Soluble (P)RR (s(P)RR), which consists of the extracellular domain of (P)RR, is present in blood and urine. Elevated plasma s(P)RR concentrations are reported in patients with chronic kidney disease and pregnant women with hypertension or diabetes mellitus. In addition, we have shown that plasma s(P)RR concentrations are elevated in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Interestingly, the levels are elevated in parallel with the severity of OSAS, but are not related to the presence of hypertension or the status of the circulating RAS in OSAS. It is known that v-ATPase activity protects cells from endogenous oxidative stress, and loss of v-ATPase activity results in chronic oxidative stress. We hypothesize that hypoxia and subsequent oxidative stress, perhaps in the brain, may be one of the factors that elevate plasma s(P)RR levels in OSAS.

AB This article reviews three new and emerging risk factors for stillbirth that may be modifiable or might identify a compromised fetus. We focus on fetal movements, maternal sleep, and maternal diet. Recent studies have suggested than a sudden increase in vigorous fetal activity may be associated with increased risk of stillbirth. We review the papers that have reported this finding and discuss the implications as well as potential future directions for research. There is emerging literature to suggest that maternal sleep position may be a risk for stillbirth, especially if the woman settles to sleep supine. This risk is biologically plausible. How this knowledge may be utilized to assist stillbirth reduction strategies is discussed. Finally, we examine the somewhat limited literature regarding maternal diet and pregnancy outcome. Introducing probiotics into the diet may prove useful, but further work is required. The possible next steps for research are considered, as well as some potential intervention strategies that may ultimately lead to stillbirth reduction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Reduced sleep is a strong and independent risk factor for weight gain and obesity. Maternal obesity preconception and throughout gestation can increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and impact on offspring health in later life. This study investigated the relationship between sleeping behaviour and macronutrient intake in childbearing aged women.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health 1973-78 cohort, aged 31-36 years in 2009 (n = 8200). Subjective sleeping behaviour was reported and macronutrient intake was measured using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to derive sleeping patterns. Multivariate regression analysis was used to investigate the relationships between sleep and macronutrient intake.
   RESULTS: LCA identified three sleep patterns: (LC1) average sleep (similar to 8 h) with no adverse sleep-related symptoms (n = 3570); (LC2) average sleep (similar to 8 h) with sleeping difficulties and severe tiredness (n = 2109); and (LC3) short sleep (similar to 6 h) with sleeping difficulties and severe tiredness (n = 915). In fully adjusted models, LC2 was inversely associated with percentage energy as protein (b = -0.24; P = 0.01) and the protein-to-carbohydrate ratio (b = -0.01; Po0.05). LC3 was positively associated with percentage of energy as fat (b = 0.29; P = 0.01), saturated fat (b = 0.24; P = o0.001) and monounsaturated fat (b = 0.09; P = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: Sleeping behaviour patterns were associated with macronutrient intake in childbearing aged women. Improved sleep patterns, together with diet and physical activity strategies, may make it easier for women to achieve a balanced diet and optimise their weight status in preparation for pregnancy.

AB To critique the evidence from recent and ongoing obesity prevention interventions in the first 1000 days in order to identify evidence gaps and weaknesses, and to make suggestions for more informative future intervention trials.
   Completed and ongoing intervention trials have had fairly modest effects, have been limited largely to high-income countries, and have used relatively short-term interventions and outcomes. Comparison of the evidence from completed prevention trials with the evidence from systematic reviews of behavioral risk factors shows that some life-course stages have been neglected (pre-conception and toddlerhood), and that interventions have neglected to target some important behavioral risk factors (maternal smoking during pregnancy, infant and child sleep). Finally, while obesity prevention interventions aim to modify body composition, few intervention trials have used body composition measures as outcomes, and this has limited their sensitivity to detect intervention effects. The new WHO Healthy Lifestyles Trajectory (HeLTI) initiative should address some of these weaknesses.
   Future early obesity prevention trials should be much more ambitious. They should, ideally: extend their interventions over the first 1000 days; have longer-term (childhood) outcomes, and improved outcome measures (body composition measures in addition to proxies for body composition such as the BMI for age); have greater emphasis on maternal smoking and child sleep; be global.

AB Purpose We evaluate the impact of maternal and post-weaning high-fat (HF) diet on ovarian follicular population, steroidogenesis, and gene expression with a focus on the circadian clock system and insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) in adult offspring ovaries, and to elucidate whether a maternal and post-weaning diet confers similar risks.
   Methods Virgin Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with normal chow (C) diet or HF diet for 5 weeks before mating, during gestation, and lactation. Female offspring were fed with the C or HF diet from weaning to 6 months of age, resulting in four study groups (n = 6 per group): C/C, C/HF, HF/C, and HF/HF.
   Results Ovaries from offspring exposed to post-weaning HF diet (i.e., the C/HF and HF/HF groups) had a decrease in small follicle numbers, but with similar numbers of antral follicles and corpora lutea. Offspring from HF-fed dams (i.e., the HF/C and HF/HF groups) had increased plasma estradiol concentrations and decreased luteinizing hormone levels at 6 months of age. In addition, Igf2 and each of the circadian rhythm core genes Clock, Per1, Per2, and Per3 were increased in the ovaries of offspring exposed to maternal HF diet (both HF/C and HF/HF groups).
   Conclusions Maternal and post-weaning HF diet programs the reproductive profile of the female offspring in adult life through different manners. Post-weaning HF intake resulted in the reduction of small follicles in adulthood, whereas maternal HF diet had long-term deleterious consequences on female offspring steroidogenesis and coincided with alteration of the upregulation of the imprinted gene Igf2 and changes in ovarian circadian rhythms.

DE genocide; trauma; Rwanda; HIV/AIDS; PTSD
AB The study investigated the trauma inflicted by the Rwandan genocide and its aftermath among Rwandans who nowadays reside in the Diaspora in Finland, their ways of coping with their trauma, and whether they thought reconciliation possible. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through interviews of 40 Rwandans, 20 males (mean age 37.6 years, SD 16.4 years) and 20 females (mean age 47.6 years, SD 14.9 years), selected representatively from 14 different locations of Finland. It was found that 57.5% of the respondents had lost one or more family member during the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi. In this sample, 72.5% reported being traumatized, and of these, 37.5% extremely traumatized. Fifty percent reported having sleeping problems often, and of these, 22.5% very often. Seventy-five percent reported having bad dreams at least sometimes, 30% of these often, and 20% very often. Thirty percent of women and 5% of men reported having been raped. Of these, 15% of the women became pregnant due to the rape, and 10% were contaminated with HIV/AIDS. Ten percent of the respondents were born as a result of rape. Although 50% reported living peacefully with other Rwandans, 35% considered reconciliation difficult or extremely difficult. In conclusion, the Rwandan Diaspora living in Finland were severely traumatized by the genocide, and still, 22 years later, reconciliation appears difficult.

AB Background In 2007, we published an opinion document to review the role of pegvisomant (PEG) in the treatment of acromegaly. Since then, new evidence emerged on the biochemical and clinical effects of PEG and on its long-term efficacy and safety.
   Aim We here reviewed the emerging aspects of the use of PEG in clinical practice in the light of the most recent literature.
   Results The clinical use of PEG is still suboptimal, considering that it remains the most powerful tool to control IGF-I in acromegaly allowing to obtain, with a pharmacological treatment, the most important clinical effects in terms of signs and symptoms, quality of life and comorbidities. The number of patients with acromegaly exposed to PEG worldwide has become quite elevated and the prolonged follow-up allows now to deal quite satisfactorily with many clinical issues including major safety issues, such as the concerns about possible tumour (re) growth under PEG. The positive or neutral impact of PEG on glucose metabolism has been highlighted, and the clinical experience, although limited, with sleep apnoea and pregnancy has been reviewed. Finally, the current concept of somatostatin receptor ligands (SRL) resistance has been addressed, in order to better define the acromegaly patients to whom the PEG option may be offered.
   Conclusions PEG increasingly appears to be an effective and safe medical option for many patients not controlled by SRL but its use still needs to be optimized.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Objectives: To examine the association between sleep duration in early pregnancy and fetal growth in a prospective cohort study of 3567 Chinese women.
   Methods: Pregnant women at 8-16 weeks of gestation were interviewed using a semi-quantitative questionnaire to assess sleep duration. Birth weight and birth length were measured by a midwife in the delivery room at birth; low birth weight (LBW) was defined as birth weight <2500 g and small for gestational age (SGA) was defined as <10th customized centile.
   Results: The average age of participants was 28.21 +/- 3.38 years old. The mean sleep duration was 8.39 +/- 1.13 h/day. A total of 1290 women sleeping >= 9 h/day, 1563 sleeping 8 to <9 h/day, 550 sleeping 7 to <8 h/day, and 164 sleeping <7 h/day. Compared to the sleeping 8 to <9 h/day group, birth length and birth weight of the sleeping <7 h/day group decreased by 2.42 mm (95% CI: -4.27, -0.58, p = 0.010) and 42.70 g (95% CI: -103.02, 17.62, p = 0.165), respectively; and rislc of LBW and SGA of the sleeping <7 h/day group increased by 83% (95% CI: 0.59, 5.73, p = 0.297) and 56% (95% CI: 0.84, 2.92, p = 0.159), respectively; birth length of the sleeping <7 h/day group was decreased more in male babies, and among mothers without a midday napping habit or with a history of abortion (all p for interaction <0.05).
   Conclusions: Shorter sleep duration in early pregnancy was associated with birth length. Our findings indicate that midday napping may be a protective factor for birth length among pregnant women with shorter sleep duration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundPoor sleep during pregnancy has been associated with poorer birth outcomes. High body mass index (BMI) is often associated with poor sleep, but little is known about the relationship between gestational weight gain and sleep in late pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationships of both gestational weight gain and pre-pregnancy BMI to objective and subjective measures of sleep during late pregnancy.
   MethodsPregnant women (n=128) were recruited from prenatal clinics and childbirth classes primarily serving low-income women. Their sleep (disruption and duration) was objectively assessed in their last month of pregnancy with 72hours of wrist actigraphy monitoring. Their perceived sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Pre-pregnancy and late pregnancy height and weight were assessed by self-report and used to calculate BMI and gestational weight gain, which were then grouped into standardized categories.
   ResultsMean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score was 6.83.1 (range 2-16). Sixty percent had excess gestational weight gain and it was associated with poorer perceived sleep quality, but was unrelated to objective measures of sleep duration and disruption. Pre-pregnancy BMI was unrelated to all sleep parameters. However, analyses of the interaction of pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain indicated that excess weight gain was associated with shorter sleep duration and more sleep disruption, but only among women who were overweight before pregnancy.
   ConclusionPregnancy is an opportunity to promote long-term women's health with a better understanding of the relationship between weight management and healthy sleep habits.

AB This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of parenting interventions on parent, infant and parent-infant relationship outcome measures for parents of infants under 12 months old. Parent outcomes examined included competence, and confidence; baby outcomes included infant behaviours of crying, settling, and sleeping problems and parent-infant relationship outcomes included parental responsiveness. Systematic searches of five databases were carried out. In total, 36 randomised controlled trials over the past 35 years were included in the meta-analyses, with a total of 4880 participants. Interventions were carried out either during pregnancy or within the first 12 months after birth and involved teaching specific strategies and provision of information on infant development and behaviour. Mean effect sizes were obtained using a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach to meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was found on parent responsiveness and infant sleep. Potential moderator variables were assessed for these two outcomes using the SEM approach. Results showed that early parenting interventions are effective in improving parental responsiveness (d = 0.77), and improving or preventing infant sleep problems (d = 0.24), but not crying problems (d = 0.27) possibly due to low power. No conclusions could be drawn in regards to parental competence or confidence. Moderator analysis showed that for interventions aimed at improving responsiveness, briefer interventions were more effective than longer ones; and studies published more recently reported smaller effects than older studies. No other moderators influenced the assessed intervention outcomes. The findings of this study provide further evidence for the positive effects of early parenting interventions for infants under 12 months of age, however future research is needed to assess intervention effects on parental competence and confidence.

AB Introduction: Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a sensory motor disorder. Patients with this syndrome have serious and uncontrollable desire to move their legs, which is mostly due to an uncomfortable feeling intensified when they are motionless. It may be a genetic disorder or secondary to iron deficiency, neurodegenerations, pregnancy, some drugs and severe kidney diseases.
   Objectives: This study was designed to find out the prevalence and its risk factors of RLS in hemodialysis patients.
   Patients and Methods: This multicenter cross-sectional study was done on 260 hemodialysis patients. The prevalence of RLS was measured using International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG)'s RLS Questionnaire (RLSQ). Potential risk factors for RLS including underlying cause of chronic renal failure, duration on dialysis, biochemical tests, dialysis adequacy, and erythropoietin and also venofer dosage in recent month and demographic data were also evaluated.
   Results: The prevalence of RLS was 55% including 59.4% males and 40.6% females. Their mean age of RLS patients and their dialysis duration were significantly higher than other group (P < 0.05). Their body mass index (BMI) and serum calcium were significantly higher (P < 0.05). However erythropoietin dosage and serum hemoglobin level were lower in RLS patients (P < 0.05). Significant predictors of RLS were history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), smoking (P < 0.05). There was not significant relation between RLS and dialysis adequacy, serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), urea, ferritin and venofer dosage (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion: According to the results, RLS is a common disorder in hemodialysis patients which can affect strongly on their life. So particular attention and sooner diagnosis of RLS in high risk patients for better management is necessary.

   RAT SKELETAL-MUSCLE; CATCH-UP GROWTH; FACTOR 21 FGF21
AB The regulation of linear growth by nutritional and inflammatory influences is examined in terms of growth-plate endochondral ossification, in order to better understand stunted growth in children. Linear growth is controlled by complex genetic, physiological, and nutrient-sensitive endocrine/paracrine/autocrine mediated molecular signalling mechanisms, possibly including sleep adequacy through its influence on growth hormone secretion. Inflammation, which accompanies most infections and environmental enteric dysfunction, inhibits endochondral ossification through the action of mediators including proinflammatory cytokines, the activin A-follistatin system, glucocorticoids and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). In animal models linear growth is particularly sensitive to dietary protein as well as Zn intake, which act through insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its binding proteins, triiodothyronine, amino acids and Zn2+ to stimulate growth-plate protein and proteoglycan synthesis and cell cycle progression, actions which are blocked by corticosteroids and inflammatory cytokines. Observational human studies indicate stunting to be associated with nutritionally poor, mainly plant-based diets. Intervention studies provide some support for deficiencies of energy, protein, Zn and iodine and for multiple micronutrient deficiencies, at least during pregnancy. Of the animal-source foods, only milk has been specifically and repeatedly shown to exert an important influence on linear growth in both undernourished and well-nourished children. However, inflammation, caused by infections, environmental enteric dysfunction, which may be widespread in the absence of clean water, adequate sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and endogenous inflammation associated with excess adiposity, in each case contributes to stunting, and may explain why nutritional interventions are often unsuccessful. Current interventions to reduce stunting are targeting WASH as well as nutrition.

TI PHQ-8 minor depression among pregnant women: association with somatic

SO ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH

DE Antenatal; Minor depression; Pregnancy; Somatic symptoms; BRFSS
ID PERINATAL DEPRESSION; PREVALENCE; ANXIETY; RISK
AB It was recently reported that pregnant women were more likely to have minor depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 depression scale (PHQ-8), (as reported by Kroenke and Spitzer (Psychiatr Ann 32(9):1-7, 2002), and Kroenke et al. (J Affect 114(1-3):163-173, 2009)) compared to women who were not pregnant (as reported by Ashley et al. (Arch Womens Ment Health 19(2):395-400, 2015)). The present study is designed to investigate if somatic symptoms (energy level, appetite, sleep) associated with both pregnancy and depression were responsible for this increased prevalence of minor depression. A sample of pregnant women (n = 404) was compared to women who were not pregnant (n = 6754). Both groups scored within the minor depression range on the PHQ-8 and comparisons were based on participants' responses to PHQ-8 items. Results indicate that of the somatic symptoms of depression, only changes in energy level accounted for the elevated prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women compared to women who are not pregnant. Removing the decreased energy item from the score determination reduces the prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women to a level significantly below that of women who are not pregnant. Emotional symptoms such as feeling down and feeling like a failure were less likely to be reported by pregnant women compared to women who were not pregnant. Implications for depression screening during pregnancy are discussed.

AB We describe the case of a 23-year-old white female, 10-12 weeks pregnant, with a history of intravenous drug use and a recently diagnosed pneumonia, who was found deceased in her bed after a night of sleep. Although postmortem serum toxicology tested positive for alprazolam, tetrahydrocannabinol, and morphine, the ultimate cause of death was determined to be cardiac tamponade secondary to an isolated abscess in the ascending aorta. The patient had several risk factors for aortic rupture and cardiac tamponade including intravenous drug use, pneumonia, and pregnancy. However, an autopsy of the patient showed an isolated abscess of the ascending aorta without evidence of infective endocarditis, coronary artery rupture, aortic aneurysm, or aortic dissection making this an unusual case of cardiac tamponade. The aim of this case report is to encourage providers to obtain a tissue culture of any aortic abscesses so that the organisms involved can be identified. The identification of such organisms may help guide antimicrobial treatment in similar presentations in the future.

AB Sleep problems during pregnancy impair maternal health and increase the risk for adverse pregnancy outcome. The circadian preference toward eveningness has been associated with sleep problems in previous studies. Here, we studied whether evening-type women had more sleep problems during their pregnancy, as compared with other chronotypes, in a sample consisting of 1653 pregnant women from the Finnish CHILD-SLEEP Birth Cohort. Chronotype was assessed with a shortened version of the morningness-eveningness questionnaire. Pregnant evening-type women reported more sleep problems, including troubles of falling asleep ( OR = 3.4, p < 0.0001), poor sleep quality ( OR = 2.9, p < 0.01) and daily tiredness ( OR = 3.2, p < 0.0001) than the morning-type women, even after controlling for sleep duration and sleep deprivation. They had higher scores on Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( p < 0.05), Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire ( p < 0.0001) and Global Seasonality Score ( p < 0.01) and were also more often smokers, also during pregnancy ( p < 0.001) and reported poorer general health ( p < 0.001) than the morning-type women. They also reported having had more sleep problems during their childhood ( OR = 1.5, p < 0.05) and adolescence ( OR = 2.0, p < 0.001) than the morning-type women. Our results indicate that eveningness is associated with more sleep problems and unhealthy life habits during pregnancy.

AB The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea is unknown during pregnancy, but the syndrome is likely underdiagnosed and rising in frequency along with the obesity epidemic. Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with adverse outcomes, including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, preterm, and cesarean delivery. Obese pregnant women should be screened and referred to a sleep medicine specialist for evaluation. Continuous positive airway pressure is the treatment of choice with demonstrated safety and compliance in pregnancy. Early anesthesia consultation allows for preparation and implementation of a peripartum plan that includes early labor analgesia, avoidance of respiratory depressants, and closer monitoring of oxygenation.

AB We investigated the regulation of hepatic ER stress in healthy liver and adult or perinatally programmed diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Female mice were fed either obesogenic or control diet before mating, during pregnancy and lactation. Post-weaning, offspring from each maternal group were divided into either obesogenic or control diet. At six months, offspring were sacrificed at 4-h intervals over 24h. Offspring fed obesogenic diets developed NAFLD phenotype, and the combination of maternal and offspring obesogenic diets exacerbated this phenotype. UPR signalling pathways (IREa, PERK, ATF6) and their downstream regulators showed different basal rhythmicity, which was modified in offspring exposed to obesogenic diet and maternal programming. The double obesogenic hit increased liver apoptosis measured by TUNEL staining, active caspase-3 and phospho-JNK and GRP78 promoter methylation levels. This study demonstrates that hepatic UPR is rhythmically activated. The combination of maternal obesity (MO) and obesogenic diets in offspring triggered altered UPR rhythmicity, DNA methylation and cellular apoptosis.

AB Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive drug in the world. Natural sources of caffeine include coffee, tea, and chocolate. Synthetic caffeine is also added to products to promote arousal, alertness, energy, and elevated mood. Over the past decade, the introduction of new caffeine-containing food products, as well as changes in consumption patterns of the more traditional sources of caffeine, has increased scrutiny by health authorities and regulatory bodies about the overall consumption of caffeine and its potential cumulative effects on behavior and physiology. Of particular concern is the rate of caffeine intake among populations potentially vulnerable to the negative effects of caffeine consumption: pregnant and lactating women, children and adolescents, young adults, and people with underlying heart or other health conditions, such as mental illness. Here, we review the research into the safety and safe doses of ingested caffeine in healthy and in vulnerable populations. We report that, for healthy adults, caffeine consumption is relatively safe, but that for some vulnerable populations, caffeine consumption could be harmful, including impairments in cardiovascular function, sleep, and substance use. We also identified several gaps in the literature on which we based recommendations for the future of caffeine research.

AB Health-related quality of life (QOL) is reported to be reduced during pregnancy. Associations between QOL, physical activity (PA), insomnia, depression and worry are insufficiently investigated among pregnant women. The aim of this study was to evaluate QOL and PA patterns among healthy pregnant women, and to examine how QOL might correlate to PA, sleep, worry and depression. This is an observational cross-sectional study, conducted among a convenient sample of 141 healthy pregnant women using five questionnaires: WHOQOL-brief (WHO quality of life questionnaire, brief version, ISI (Insomnia Severity Index), PSWQ (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), ZSRDS (Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale), and Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ). Pre-gestational BMI was inversely correlated to overall health while education was positively correlated to psychological health, social relationships and environment domains. Smoking before and during pregnancy significantly impacted the general health and psychological health. Total and light PA were positively correlated to psychological health and social relationships. Sports/exercise showed positive correlations with several QOL domains. Insomnia and depression were significantly associated with a decrease in all domains of QOL, while worries were associated with a decrease in physical, psychological and environmental domains. There were significant negative correlations between ZSRDS scores and total activity. PA, worries, depression and insomnia affected QOL during pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnant women presenting depression had a reduced total PA. Sleep and mental health as well as encouraging PA during pregnancy are necessary to improve the quality of life of pregnant women.

AB Background: Pregnant women with depression and/or anxiety prior to pregnancy are at higher risk of preterm birth, breastfeeding problems, postpartum depression, and disruption of the mother-infant attachment. It is well documented that exercise improves psychological well-being in nonpregnant subjects with symptoms of depression. However, in only a few small studies have researchers examined the effect of exercise on symptoms of depression among pregnant women. We hypothesize that physiotherapist-supervised group exercise for pregnant women at risk of antenatal depression increases their psychological well-being. This paper describes the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a supervised group exercise intervention for pregnant women with a current or previous history of depression and/or anxiety.
   Methods/design: The RCT is being carried out at the Department of Obstetrics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, in the period 2016-2019. The inclusion criteria are pregnant women >= 18 years of age with depression and/or anxiety requiring treatment by a psychiatrist or a psychologist within the last 10 years and/or intake of antidepressants in the 3 months prior to conception and/or during pregnancy. The women must have appropriate Danish language skills, be pregnant with a single fetus, give written informed consent, and be at 17-22 gestational weeks when the intervention begins. The primary outcome is psychological well-being (the five-item World Health Organization Well-being Index). Secondary outcomes are symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), functional ability (General Health Questionnaire), clinical symptoms of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), sleep quality and sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and pregnancy and delivery outcomes. The intervention is supervised group exercise twice weekly for 12 weeks. The control group will receive standard antenatal care. On the basis of sample size calculation, a total of 300 women will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group in a ratio of 1:1.
   Discussion: The trial is expected to contribute to the body of knowledge used in planning antenatal care for pregnant women at risk of depression.

AB An affordable, user-friendly fertility-monitoring tool remains an unmet need. We examine in this study the correlation between pulse rate (PR) and the menstrual phases using wrist-worn PR sensors. 91 healthy, non-pregnant women, between 22-42 years old, were recruited for a prospective-observational clinical trial. Participants measured PR during sleep using wrist-worn bracelets with photoplethysmographic sensors. Ovulation day was estimated with "Clearblue Digital-Ovulation-urine test". Potential behavioral and nutritional confounders were collected daily. 274 ovulatory cycles were recorded from 91 eligible women, with a mean cycle length of 27.3 days (+/- 2.7). We observed a significant increase in PR during the fertile window compared to the menstrual phase (2.1 beat-per-minute, p < 0.01). Moreover, PR during the mid-luteal phase was also significantly elevated compared to the fertile window (1.8 beat-per-minute, p < 0.01), and the menstrual phase (3.8 beat-per-minute, p < 0.01). PR increase in the ovulatory and mid-luteal phase was robust to adjustment for the collected confounders. There is a significant increase of the fertile-window PR (collected during sleep) compared to the menstrual phase. The aforementioned association was robust to the inter-and intra-person variability of menstrual-cycle length, behavioral, and nutritional profiles. Hence, PR monitoring using wearable sensors could be used as one parameter within a multi-parameter fertility awareness-based method.

AB This study explores how women consider embodied knowledge about their "biological clocks" alongside personal and professional goals as they make decisions about whether, when, and how to have children in the future. Based on 71 in-depth interviews with childless women between the ages of 25 and 40, the author proposes a holistic understanding of fertility inclusive of the biological limitations of the body as well as sociocultural factors including access to family leave, childcare, finances, housing, employment, and relationship status. By expanding our understanding of fertility to include the social, we can better understand why women considering having children advocate for social structural changes just as much as if not more than increased access to reproductive technologies.

AB Drugs used in the treatment of depression can cross the placenta giving rise to questions regarding the effects these drugs exert on the fetus. Hypericum perforatum L., Hypericaceae, is a natural product used to treat depression. However, information about its toxicity and the occurrence of alterations in the central nervous system development of the offspring is scarce. This work assessed the behavior of adult male rats born from mothers treated with Hypericum extract during gestation and analyzed the fluorescence of the extract in different organs of mothers and fetuses. Male pups were divided into three treated groups, corresponding to the administration of the Hypericum extract to mothers at the dose levels of 36 mg/kg, 72 mg/kg and 144 mg/kg, and one control group in which the mothers received distilled water. At 90 days of age, the offspring underwent the following tests: rotarod, pentobarbital-induced sleep time, elevated plus maze, hole-board and forced swimming test. The observed fluorescence indicated the presence of the extract in all tissues analyzed. The obtained results suggest lasting changes in the performances displayed in the CNS, depression and anxiety tests, indicating that the use of Hypericum during gestation could interfere with the behavioral development of the offspring reducing anxiety and depression when they become adults. We suggest that these alterations are associated with the reprogramming of the brain regions related to changes in emotional reactivity. (C) 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Farmacognosia.

   Design Sleep intervention within a randomised controlled trial for the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) study.
   Participants 802 families were randomly allocated to one of four groups: usual care (control), sleep intervention (sleep), food, activity and breastfeeding intervention (FAB), and combined group receiving both interventions (combination).
   Interventions All groups received standard Well Child care. The sleep intervention groups (sleep and combination) received an antenatal group education session (all mothers and most partners) emphasising infant self-settling and safe sleeping, and a home visit at 3 weeks reinforcing the antenatal sleep education. FAB and combination groups received four contacts providing education and support on breast feeding, food and activity up to 4 months postpartum.
   Outcome measures Here we report secondary sleep outcomes from the POI study: the prevalence of parent-reported infant sleep problems and night waking, and differences in sleep duration. Additional outcomes reported include differences in infant self-settling, safe sleep practices, and maternal and partner reports of their own sleep, fatigue and depression symptoms.
   Results Linear or mixed linear regression models found no significant intervention effects on sleep outcomes, with 19.1% of mothers and 16.6% of partners reporting their infant's sleep a problem at 6 months. Actigraphy estimated the number of night wakings to be significantly reduced (8%) and the duration of daytime sleep increased (6 min) in those groups receiving the sleep intervention compared with those who did not. However, these small differences were not clinically significant and not observed in 24 hours infant sleep diary data. No other differences were observed.
   Conclusion A strategy delivering infant sleep education antenatally and at 3 weeks postpartum was not effective in preventing the development of parent-reported infant sleep problems.

AB Objective: To determine pregnant women's preferences for the treatment of insomnia: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-I), pharmacotherapy, or acupuncture.
   Design: A cross-sectional survey of pregnant women.
   Setting: We recruited participants in person at a low-risk maternity clinic and a pregnancy and infant trade show and invited them to complete an online questionnaire.
   Participants: The sample (N = 187) was primarily White (70%), married or common-law married (96%), and on average 31 years of age; the mean gestational age was 28 weeks.
   Methods: Participants read expert-validated descriptions of CBT-I, pharmacotherapy, and acupuncture and then indicated their preferences and perceptions of each approach.
   Results: Participants indicated that if they experienced insomnia, they preferred CBT-I to other approaches, chi(2) (2) = 38.10, p < .001. They rated CBT-I as the most credible treatment (eta(2)(partial) = .22, p < .001) and had stronger positive reactions to it than to the other two approaches (eta(2)(partial) = 37, p <. 001).
   Conclusion: Participants preferred CBT-I for insomnia during pregnancy. This preference is similar to previously reported preferences for psychotherapy for treatment of depression and anxiety during pregnancy. It is important for clinicians to consider women's preferences when discussing possible treatment for insomnia.

AB How nonhuman primates deal with birth, at the moment of delivery, and during the following days, remains poorly explored because of the unpredictability of this event, particularly for forest-dwelling arboreal species. Available studies highlight intra-and interspecific variation which suggest flexibility of the timing of delivery, of behavior associated with labor contractions and parturition, and the social context and ambient noise surrounding delivery. Here, we present the findings of a two-decade survey of reproduction in a population of captive Campbell's monkeys. Analysis of 34 births (with a female-biased sex ratio) showed that deliveries occurred systematically at night and more frequently during week-ends and in fall (September-November). This suggests the existence of both circadian and infradian biological rhythms. We present the first detailed description of a birth for this species and its short-term social consequences. In line with previous findings for other monkeys and apes, labor (estimated by unusual stretching postures) and parturition were rapid, and delivery occurred in a clear social and vocal context. During the following days, the new mother became the center of attention of for young (kin and non-kin) females and rose through the hierarchy. Wediscuss socio-ecological factors, notably captivity conditions and the high degree of tolerance in the species' social system, and confirm the existence of both "rigidity" and "flexibility" in the primates' adaptive reproductive strategies.

AB Background: The college experience is often the first time when young adults live independently and make their own lifestyle choices. These choices affect dietary behaviors, exercise habits, techniques to deal with stress, and decisions on sleep time, all of which direct the trajectory of future health. There is a need for effective strategies that will encourage healthy lifestyle choices in young adults attending college.
   Objective: This preliminary randomized controlled trial tested the effect of coaching and text messages (short message service, SMS) on self-selected health behaviors in the domains of diet, exercise, stress, and sleep. A second analysis measured the ripple effect of the intervention on health behaviors not specifically selected as a goal by participants.
   Methods: Full-time students aged 18-30 years were recruited by word of mouth and campuswide advertisements (flyers, posters, mailings, university website) at a small university in western Pennsylvania from January to May 2015. Exclusions included pregnancy, eating disorders, chronic medical diagnoses, and prescription medications other than birth control. Of 60 participants, 30 were randomized to receive a single face-to-face meeting with a health coach to review results of behavioral questionnaires and to set a health behavior goal for the 8-week study period. The face-to-face meeting was followed by SMS text messages designed to encourage achievement of the behavioral goal. A total of 30 control subjects underwent the same health and behavioral assessments at intake and program end but did not receive coaching or SMS text messages.
   Results: The texting app showed that 87.31% (2187/2505) of messages were viewed by intervention participants. Furthermore, 28 of the 30 intervention participants and all 30 control participants provided outcome data. Among intervention participants, 22 of 30 (73%) showed improvement in health behavior goal attainment, with the whole group (n=30) showing a mean improvement of 88% (95% CI 39-136). Mean improvement in any behavioral domains was not seen in the control group. Intervention participants also increased their exercise significantly compared with controls, regardless of their self-selected goal category. The increased exercise was paralleled by significantly lower fasting glucose levels.
   Conclusions: The health coaching session plus tailored SMS text messages improved self-selected health behaviors with a modest ripple effect to include unselected health behaviors.

AB Study Objectives: To characterize sleep duration, timing and continuity measures in pregnancy and their association with key demographic variables.
   Methods: Multisite prospective cohort study. Women enrolled in the nuMoM2b study (nulliparous women with a singleton gestation) were recruited at the second study visit (16-21 weeks of gestation) to participate in the Sleep Duration and Continuity substudy. Women < 18 years of age or with pregestational diabetes or chronic hypertension were excluded from participation. Women wore a wrist activity monitor and completed a sleep log for 7 consecutive days. Time in bed, sleep duration, fragmentation index, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep midpoint were averaged across valid primary sleep periods for each participant.
   Results: Valid data were available from 782 women with mean age of 27.3 (5.5) years. Median sleep duration was 7.4 hours. Approximately 27.9% of women had a sleep duration of < 7 hours; 2.6% had a sleep duration of > 9 hours. In multivariable models including age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, insurance status, and recent smoking history, sleep duration was significantly associated with race/ethnicity and insurance status, while time in bed was only associated with insurance status. Sleep continuity measures and sleep midpoint were significantly associated with all covariates in the model, with the exception of age for fragmentation index and smoking for wake after sleep onset.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the relationship between sleep and important demographic characteristics during pregnancy.

AB Objective/Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate medical comorbidity patterns in patients with a narcolepsy diagnosis in the United States.
   Patients/Methods: This was a retrospective medical claims data analysis. Truven Health Analytics MarketScan (R) Research Databases were accessed to identify individuals >= 18 years of age with >= 1 diagnosis code for narcolepsy (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9, 347.0, 347.00, 347.01, 347.1, 347.10, or 347.11) continuously insured between 2006 and 2010, and controls without narcolepsy matched 5:1 on age, gender, region, and payer. Narcolepsy and control subjects were compared for frequency of co-morbid conditions, identified by the appearance of >1 diagnosis code(s) mapped to a Clinical Classification System (CCS) level 1 category any time during the study period, and on specific subcategories, including recognized narcolepsy comorbidities of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and depression.
   Results: The final study group included 9312 subjects with narcolepsy and 46,559 controls (each group: average age, 46.1 years; 59% female). As compared with controls, patients with narcolepsy showed a statistically significant excess prevalence in all the CCS multilevel categories, the only exceptions being conditions originating in the perinatal period and pregnancy/childbirth complications. The greatest excess prevalence in the narcolepsy cohort was seen for mental illness (31.1% excess prevalence; odds ratio (OR) 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6, 4.0), followed by diseases of the digestive system (21.4% excess prevalence; OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.5, 2.8) and nervous system/sense organs (excluding narcolepsy; 20.7% excess prevalence; OR 3.7, 95% CI 3.4, 3.9).
   Conclusions: In this claims analysis, a narcolepsy diagnosis was associated with a wide range of comorbid medical illness claims, at significantly higher rates than matched controls. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Allostatic load in early pregnancy is associated with poor sleep quality

AB Background: Allostatic load (AL) measures the cumulative impact of chronic stress and is associated with adverse health outcomes. A novel scoring system has previously been developed for AL in early pregnancy that is associated with pre-eclampsia. It was hypothesized that AL, as identified by the present model, is associated with psychosocial stressors and, specifically, poor sleep quality.
   Methods: Women were selected from a low-risk, community-dwelling study population who enrolled at <15 weeks gestation. Nine physiologic components were divided among the domains of cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory function. Spearman's rank correlations were used to examine the association of AL with age, income, the Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ), Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare AL by race and educational attainment.
   Results: A total of 103 women were identified, with: a mean age of 29.8 +/- 5.0 years, 17.5% black, and mean gestational age 12.2 +/- 1.1 weeks. Allostatic load was positively correlated with the PSQI (rho = 0.23, p = 0.018). There were no associations with age, income, prenatal distress, race, or depression scores. College-educated women had lower AL compared with those with less education (0.57 +/- 0.43 vs 0.81 +/- 0.55, p = 0.045).
   Conclusion: Higher AL, measured by the pregnancy-specific model, was associated with poorer sleep quality and lower educational attainment, both of which were considered to be chronic stressors. These relationships were consistent with previous findings in non-pregnant populations, and suggest that AL may be useful for capturing the physiologic impact of chronic stress in early pregnancy.

AB We sought to synthesize a comprehensive literature review comprising recent research linking fetal programming to fetal telomere length. We also explored the potential effects fetal telomere length shortening has on fetal phenotypes. Utilizing the PubMed database as our primary search engine, we retrieved and reviewed 165 articles of published research. The inclusion criteria limited the articles to those that appeared within the last ten years, were pertinent to humans, and without restriction to language of publication. Our results showed that socio-demographic factors like age, sex, genetic inheritance, and acquired disease impact telomere length. Further, we found several maternal characteristics to be associated with fetal telomere length shortening, and these include maternal chemical exposure (eg, tobacco smoke), maternal stress during pregnancy, maternal nutritional and sleeping disorders during pregnancy as well as maternal disease status. Due to paucity of data, our review could not synthesize evidence directly linking fetal phenotypes to telomere length shortening. Although the research summarized in this review shows some association between determinants of intrauterine programming and fetal telomere length, there is still significant work that needs to be done to delineate the direct relationship of telomere attrition with specific fetal phenotypes.

AB Background: Understanding risk factors that may vary culturally can help improve preventive strategies for obesity. This is the first cross-sectional study aimed to determine the risk factors for overweight/obesity in children aged 2-6 years in a central Anatolian city in Turkey.
   Methods: A total of 1582 children (1351 healthy, 231 overweight/ obese) aged 2-6 years were included from the Anthropometry of Turkish Children aged 0-6 years database. Age, gender, birth weight, birth order, mother's age, mother's body mass index (BMI), weight gain of mothers during pregnancy, presence of gestational diabetes, breastfeeding duration, history of formula feeding, mother's and father's education, mother's job, monthly income, smoking at home and physical activity, sleep duration and duration of television (TV) watching of the children were evaluated as independent risk factors. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate risk factors for overweight/obesity.
   Results: Having a high family income compared to bad [odds ratio (OR) = 1.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.237-3.106], increased the time of watching TV during the weekend (OR = 1.094; 95% CI: 1.032-1.159), and similar physical activity level according to their peers compared to less (OR = 2.957; 95% CI: 1.056-8.282) were found to be significantly associated with a higher risk of overweight/ obesity in children aged 2-6 years old.
   Conclusions: The early childhood period seems to be important in the establishment of healthy behavioral patterns, especially limitation of TV watching and encouragement of physical activity. Obesogenic environment in families with high incomes need to be revealed.

AB Objectives: To determine at the peak age for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) the ventilatory response to hypoxia of infants whose mothers substance misused in pregnancy (SM infants), or smoked during pregnancy (S mothers) and controls whose mothers neither substance misused or smoked. In addition, we compared the ventilatory response to hypoxia during the neonatal period and peak age of SIDS. Working hypothesis: Infants of S or SMmothers compared to control infantswould have a poorer ventilatory response to hypoxia at the peak age of SIDS. Study Design: Prospective, observational study. Patient-subject selection: Twelve S; 12 SM and 11 control infants were assessed at 6-12 weeks of age and in the neonatal period. Methodology: Changes in minute volume, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and end tidal carbon dioxide levels on switching from breathing room air to 15% oxygen were assessed. Maternal and infant urine samples were tested for cotinine, cannabinoids, opiates, amphetamines, methadone, cocaine, and benzodiazepines. Results: The S and SM infants had a greater decline in minute volume (P = 0.037, P = 0.016, respectively) and oxygen saturation (P = 0.031) compared to controls. In all groups, the magnitude of decline in minute volume in response to hypoxia was higher in the neonatal period compared to at 6-12 weeks (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Both maternal substance misuse and smoking were associated with an impaired response to a hypoxic challenge at the peak age for SIDS. The hypoxic ventilatory decline was more marked in the neonatal period compared to the peak age for SIDS indicating a maturational effect. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BackgroundSevere post-caesarean pain remains an important issue associated with persistent pain and postpartum depression. Women's sleep quality prior to caesarean delivery and its influence on postoperative pain and analgesic intake have not been evaluated yet.
   MethodsWomen undergoing caesarean delivery with spinal anaesthesia (bupivacaine 12mg, fentanyl 20g, morphine 100g) were evaluated preoperatively for sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire (PSQI 0-5 indicating good sleep quality, PSQI 6-21 poor sleep quality). Peak and average postoperative pain scores at rest, movement and uterine cramping were evaluated during 24h using a verbal numerical pain score (VNPS; 0 indicating no pain and 100 indicating worst pain imaginable), and analgesic intake was recorded. Primary outcome was peak pain upon movement during the first 24h.
   ResultsSeventy-eight of 245 women reported good sleep quality (31.2%; average PSQI 3.51.2) and 167 poor sleep quality (68.2%; average PSQI 16.03.4; p<0.001). Women with poor sleep quality had significantly higher peak pain scores upon movement (46.7 +/- 28.8 vs. 36.2 +/- 25.6, respectively; p=0.006). With multivariable logistic regression analysis, poor sleep quality significantly increased the risk for severe peak pain upon movement (VNPS 70; OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.2-6.0; p=0.02).
   DiscussionA significant proportion of women scheduled for caesarean delivery were identified preoperatively as having poor sleep quality, which was associated with more severe pain and increased analgesic intake after delivery. The PSQI score may therefore be a useful tool to predict increased risk for acute post-caesarean pain and higher analgesic requirements, and help tailor anaesthetic management.
   SignificanceMultiple studies have evaluated predictors for severe acute pain after caesarean delivery that may be performed in a clinical setting, however, sleep quality prior to delivery has not been included in predictive models for post-caesarean pain. The PSQI questionnaire, a simple test to administer preoperatively, identified that up to 70% of women report poor sleep quality before delivery, and poor sleep quality was associated with increased post-caesarean pain scores and analgesic intake, indicating that PSQI could help identify preoperatively women at risk for severe pain after caesarean delivery.

AB Introduction To determine the association of fruit and vegetable consumption with overall sleep duration among pregnant women. Methods Data from the 2011 and 2012 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) were used. All women (n = 2951) of childbearing age (18-44 years) who were pregnant and responded to all fruit and vegetable consumption and sleep duration questions were included. Covariates included age, race, education level, exercise, and marital status. Data were analyzed using linear and ordinal logistic regression. Results Total daily fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with sleep duration among pregnant women, controlling for confounders [beta = -0.03, (-0.07, 0.00)]. Orange and green vegetable consumption were both inversely associated with sleep duration [beta = -0.19, (-0.38, -0.01) and beta = -0.20, (-0.33, -0.08) respectively]. Ordinal logistic regression found that the odds of meeting or exceeding sleep time recommendations increased slightly with each unit increase in total fruit and vegetable consumption [OR = 1.05 (1.003, 1.092)] and for every unit increase in fruit consumption [OR = 1.12 (1.038, 1.208)]. Women who exercised within the past 30 days reported approximately 20 min of additional sleep compared to those who did not [beta = 0.32 (0.16, 0.49)]. Age, employment status, and marital status were also independently associated with sleep duration. Discussion Sleep duration in pregnant women was associated with exercise and other demographic factors, but only mildly associated with fruit and vegetable consumption. Future research should investigate the effects of additional factors including sleep quality, gestational age, family status and other medications as potential confounders.

AB Objectives Sleep problems and deprivation are common during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies are mostly descriptive or focused on specific clinical groups and late pregnancy. We aimed to identify sleep duration trajectories during the pregnancy period, their associated factors, and impact on pregnancy and birth outcomes. Methods We studied 200 women from a mother-child cohort recruited in 2009-2011 from the French general population. We used semi-parametric models to analyze data collected through questionnaires. Results We detected three sleep duration trajectories during pregnancy: short-decreasing (< 6.5h/night, 10.8% of the sample), medium-decreasing (6.5-8h/night, 57.6%), and long-increasing (> 8h/night, 31.6%) trajectories. Factors associated with the short-decreasing trajectory relative to the medium-decreasing trajectory were older age (odds-ratio/year = 1.13 [95%Confidence-Interval 1.00-1.29]) and working > 28 weeks of gestational age (odds-ratio = 0.30 [0.10-0.90]). Sleep duration during pregnancy in this trajectory group was modified by insomniac symptoms (regression coefficient/trimester = -0.74 [Standard-Error 0.12]) and naps (regression coefficient/trimester = 0.58 [0.25]). Restless legs syndrome was the only factor associated with the long-increasing trajectory and decreased sleep duration (regression coefficient/trimester = -0.88 [0.25]). Assisted delivery (i.e. cesarean section and/or instrumental delivery) and post-partum depression were more frequent among women with the short-decreasing and long-increasing trajectories whereas cesarean section alone was more prevalent among those with the short-decreasing trajectory. Proportion of premature births was higher in the short-decreasing trajectory group. Birth-weight-z-score was lower in the long-increasing trajectory group. Conclusion We identified sleep trajectories among pregnant women with specific risk factors that could affect both pregnancy and birth outcomes. Taking these into consideration could improve both maternal and child health.

   LIPID-METABOLISM; OBESITY; DISEASE
AB Pregnancy, particularly late gestation (LG), has been associated with a relatively high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Intermittent hypoxia (IH), a hallmark of OSA, could impose significant long-term effects on somatic growth, energy homeostasis, and metabolic function in offspring. We hypothesized that IH during late pregnancy (LG-IH) may increase the propensity for metabolic dysregulation and obesity in adult offspring via epigenetic modifications. Time-pregnant female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to LG-IH or room air (LG-RA) during days 13-18 of gestation. At 24 weeks, blood samples were collected from offspring mice for lipid profiles and insulin resistance, indirect calorimetry was performed and visceral white adipose tissues (VWAT) were assessed for inflammatory cells as well as for differentially methylated gene regions (DMRs) using a methylated DNA immunoprecipitation on chip (MeDIP-chip). Body weight, food intake, adiposity index, fasting insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol levels were all significantly higher in LG-IH male but not female offspring. LG-IH also altered metabolic expenditure and locomotor activities in male offspring, and increased number of pro-inflammatory macrophages emerged in VWAT along with 1520DMRs (P < 0.0001), associated with 693 genes. Pathway analyses showed that genes affected by LG-IH were mainly associated with molecular processes related to metabolic regulation and inflammation. LG-IH induces metabolic dysfunction as reflected by increased body weight and adiposity index in adult male offspring that is paralleled by epigenomic alterations and inflammation in VWAT. Thus, perturbations to fetal environment by OSA during pregnancy can have long-term detrimental effects on the fetus, and lead to persistent metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.

AB Background: Maternal and paternal depression has been associated with infants' behavioral sleep problems. Behavioral sleep interventions, which alter parental cognitions about infant sleep, have improved infant sleep problems. This study reports relationships between parental depression, fatigue, sleep quality, and cognitions about infant sleep pre and post-intervention for a behavioral sleep problem.
   Methods: This secondary analysis of data from Canadian parents (n = 455), with healthy infants aged 6-to-8-months exposed to a behavioral sleep intervention, examined baseline data and follow-up data from 18 or 24 weeks post intervention (group teaching or printed material) exposure. Parents reported on sleep quality, fatigue, depression, and cognitions about infant sleep. Data were analyzed using Pearson's r and stepwise regression analysis.
   Results: Parents' fatigue, sleep quality, sleep cognitions, and depression scores were correlated at baseline and follow-up. At baseline, sleep quality (b =.52, 95% CI .19-. 85), fatigue (b =.48, 95% CI .33-. 63), doubt about managing infant sleep (b =.44, 95% CI .19-. 69), and anger about infant sleep (b =.69, 95% CI .44-.94) were associated with mothers' depression. At baseline, fathers' depression related to sleep quality (b =.42, 95% CI .01-.83), fatigue (b =.47, 95% CI .32-.63), and doubt about managing infant sleep (b =.50, 95% CI .24-.76). At follow-up, mothers' depression was associated with sleep quality (b =.76, 95% CI .41-1.12), fatigue (b =.25, 95% CI .14-.37), doubt about managing infant sleep (b =.44, 95% CI .16-.73), sleep anger (b =.31, 95% CI .02-.59), and setting sleep limits (b = -.22, 95% CI -.41-[-. 03]). At follow-up, fathers' depression related to sleep quality (b =.84, 95% CI .46-1.22), fatigue (b =.31, 95% CI.17-. 45), sleep doubt (b =.34, 95% CI .05-.62), and setting sleep limits (b =.25, 95% CI .01-.49).
   Conclusions: Mothers' and fathers' cognitions about infant sleep demonstrate complex relationships with their depression scores. While mothers' setting sleep limit scores are associated with decreased depression scores, fathers' setting limits scores are associated with increased depression scores. Parental doubts about managing infant sleep and difficulties with setting sleep limits require attention in interventions.

AB Objective: The quality and quantity of sleep represent important health issues in pregnant women. Sleep disturbances could be associated, beyond alteration of quality of life, with poor pregnancy outcome. Our aim was to investigate the effect of a regular, specific, medium-term physical training program on sleep characteristics in healthy pregnant women.
   Materials and methods: A total of 132 healthy pregnant women, with gestational age between 18 weeks and 22 weeks, were enrolled in a prospective study. They were allocated into two groups; the first group involved 79 women (average.age, 29.4 years) who performed a specific gymnastics program of 10 weeks, and the second group involved 53 pregnant women (average age, 27.9 years) who did not perform gymnastics. All participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire at baseline and after 10 weeks concerning general data, sleep characteristics, and psycho-emotional status. The changes arising within a diverse set of characteristics were followed and compared for the two groups using parametric and nonparametric statistics.
   Results: In the control group, we observed significant worsening of 12 out of the 14 studied parameters during the 10-week period. In comparison with the women who did not perform gymnastics, women who performed specific gymnastics showed the following characteristics: (1) significantly less deterioration of psycho-emotional status (stress and anxiety levels); (2) the same general pattern of decrease in sleep quality, which is related to the progression of pregnancy; and (3) a significant attenuation of the worsening of several sleep characteristics, such as restless sleep, snoring, diurnal tiredness, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Nocturnal and diurnal sleep quantity increased significantly in both groups.
   Conclusion: The 10-week training program designed for pregnant women has an overall beneficial effect on sleep characteristics, not by improving them but by attenuating their general deterioration related to the progression of pregnancy. Our data strengthen the general recommendation regarding participation of pregnant women in specific exercise programs, mainly for maintaining their psycho-emotional and general well-being.

AB Pregnancy rhinitis (PR), a common condition in pregnant women, is defined as long-lasting nasal congestion due to mucosal swelling and increased secretion without any signs of infection, allergy or tumor, starting at any time during pregnancy and disappearing within 2 weeks of delivery. Smoking and a sensitization to house dust mites are known risk factors. While a definitive pathophysiological concept for PR does not exist, hormonal influences are discussed. We present a stepwise therapeutic strategy for PR and an overview to the latest literature.

AB Background: Human milk is the subject of many studies, but procedures for representative sample collection have not been established. Our improved methods for milk micronutrient analysis now enable systematic study of factors that affect its concentrations.
   Objective: We evaluated the effects of sample collection protocols, variations in circadian rhythms, subject variability, and acute maternal micronutrient supplementation on milk vitamin concentrations.
   Methods: In the BMQ (Breast-Milk-Quality) study, we recruited 18 healthy women (aged 18-26 y) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, at 2-4 mo of lactation for a 3-d supplementation study. On day 1, no supplements were given; on days 2 and 3, participants consumed; similar to 1 time and 2 times, respectively, the US-Canadian Recommended Dietary Allowances for vitamins at breakfast (0800-0859). Milk was collected during every feeding from the same breast over 24 h. Milk expressed in the first 2 min (aliquot I) was collected separately from the remainder (aliquot II); a third aliquot (aliquot III) was saved by combining aliquots I and II. Thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamins B-6, B-12, A, and E and fat were measured in each sample.
   Results: Significant but small differences (14-18%) between aliquots were found for all vitamins except for vitamins B-6 and B-12. Circadian variance was significant except for fat-adjusted vitamins A and E, with a higher contribution to total variance with supplementation. Between-subject variability accounted for most of the total variance. Afternoon and evening samples best reflected daily vitamin concentrations for all study days. Acute supplementation effects were found for thiamin, riboflavin, and vitamins B-6 and A at 2-4 h postdosing, with 0.1-6.17% passing into milk. Supplementation was reflected in fasting, 24-h postdose samples for riboflavin and vitamin B-6. Maximum amounts of dose-responding vitamins in 1 feeding ranged from 4.7% to 21.8% (day 2) and 8.2% to 35.0% (day 3) of Adequate Intake.
   Conclusions: In the milk of Bangladeshi mothers, differences in vitamin concentrations between aliquots within feedings and by circadian variance were significant but small. Afternoon and evening collection provided the most-representative samples. Supplementation acutely affects some breast-milk micronutrient concentrations.

AB Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) deficiency, poor sleep quality, and night-time eating, have been independently associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but their inter-relationships are yet to be evaluated. We aimed to investigate the associations between maternal plasma 25OHD status and sleep quality and circadian eating patterns during pregnancy. Data on pregnant women (n = 890) from a prospective cohort (Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes) were analyzed. Plasma 25OHD concentration was measured, while the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and 24-h dietary recall were administered to women at 26-28 weeks' gestation. Plasma 25OHD status was defined as sufficient (>75 nmol/L), insufficient (50-75 nmol/L), or deficient (<50 nmol/L). Poor sleep quality was defined by a total global PSQI score >5. Predominantly day-time (pDT) and predominantly night-time (pNT) were defined according to consumption of greater proportion of calories (i.e., >50%) from 07:00-18:59 and from 19:00-06:59, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, women with plasma 25OHD deficiency had higher odds of poor sleep quality (odds ratio (OR) 3.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.84-6.63) and pNT eating (OR: 1.85; 95% CI 1.00-3.41) than those who were 25OHD sufficient. Our findings show the association of maternal plasma 25OHD deficiency with poor sleep quality and pNT eating at mid-pregnancy.

AB Some studies have reported that recumbent position may have advantages in patients with heart disease and in pregnancy. However, it remains controversial whether recumbent position affects autonomic nervous system activity and hemodynamics in healthy adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate alterations in heart rate variability (HRV) and hemodynamics in the supine, left recumbent and right recumbent positions in healthy young adults. A total of 80 participants aged 22.8 +/- 3.1 years were enrolled in this observational study. Fifty-eight volunteers (29 men and 29 women) maintained the supine position followed by the left and right recumbent positions, while electrocardiographic data were recorded for spectral analysis of HRV to assess cardiac vagal nerve and sympathetic nerve activities. The heart rate (HR) was significantly lower in the left recumbent position than in the other positions. There were no statistically significant differences in HRV among the three positions. Considering the possibility that the echographic procedure affects autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, the other 22 participants (11 men and 11 women) underwent an echographic evaluation of hemodynamics in the heart and inferior vena cava (IVC) across the three positions. Although a low HR was also observed, there were no statistically significant differences in the IVC or the heart blood volume between the supine and the left recumbent positions. A postural change to the left recumbent position does not affect the cardiac blood circulation or ANS activity, though it does decrease HR in healthy young adults. This finding indicates that the lower HR in the left recumbent position is not attributable to the ANS activity.

AB This study investigated the correlation between the body surface temperature (BST) and core body temperature of ewes and changes in BST during the prepartum stage in pregnant ewes. Four non-pregnant adult ewes were used in the first experiment. The BST of the upper neck, vaginal temperature (VT), and ambient temperature (AT) were measured every 10 min for seven days and analyzed for correlations. The mean (+/- SD) BST and VT of ewes during the study period were 35.4 +/- 1.7 degrees C and 39.1 +/- 0.4 degrees C, respectively, with a correlation of r = 0.62, P < 0.001. This finding suggested that the BST was associated with core body temperature in ewes. In the subsequent experiment, seven pregnant ewes in their third trimester were used to evaluate changes in BST measured at the upper neck 72 h before parturition. The mean BST at 24-0 h (0 h = time of parturition) was significantly lower than that at -72- -48 h and -48- -24 h (P < 0.05). The BST tended to decrease toward parturition; all BST measurements at -16- -3 h were significantly lower than those at 72 h (P < 0.05). A clear circadian rhythm in the BST was observed at two days and the day before parturition and an unclear circadian rhythm was observed on the day of parturition. Therefore, these findings indicate that the BST also decreases before parturition, as do vaginal and rectal temperatures.

TI Maternal salivary cortisone to cortisol ratio in late pregnancy: An
   improved method for predicting offspring birth weight

DE Pregnancy; Cortisone; Cortisol; 11-beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase;
   Offspring birth weight
ID FETAL-GROWTH; NEW-ZEALAND; STRESS; DEPRIVATION; HEALTH
AB Overexposure to maternal cortisol in utero has been associated with lower birth weight of offspring. In order to regulate fetal exposure to this hormone, placental expression of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2, an enzyme that converts active cortisol to inactive cortisone, increases across pregnancy. Because of this increase in 11-beta HSD2 activity, measuring maternal cortisol in isolation may not reflect actual fetal exposure to the hormone. Previous work by Hellgren et al. (2016) has shown that maternal serum cortisone:cortisol ratio was a better predictor of offspring birth weight than cortisol measured in isolation. This paper sought to replicate these results when examining maternal salivary cortisone:cortisol ratio. Data come from 55 pregnant women from Auckland, New Zealand. Cortisol and cortisone were measured in saliva samples collected at waking and prior to going to sleep on two consecutive weekdays between 34 and 36 weeks of gestation. We found that salivary cortisol and cortisone followed the expected diurnal rhythm and that cortisone was higher than cortisol at both times of day. Maternal bedtime cortisone:cortisol ratio was significantly and inversely related to offspring birth weight. However, waking and bedtime cortisol, as well as waking cortisone:cortisol ratio, were unrelated to birth weight. These results show that maternal salivary cortisone:cortisol ratio, like serum cortisone:cortisol ratio, is a more sensitive biomarker for predicting infant birth weight than cortisol measured in isolation. This ratio could be a valuable, minimally-invasive measurement for future studies interested in understanding the relationship between maternal HPA-axis function and offspring birth weight.

AB BACKGROUND: Both short and prolonged sleep duration have been linked to impaired glucose metabolism. Sleep patterns change during pregnancy, but prospective data are limited on their relation to gestational diabetes.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to prospectively examine the trimester-specific (first and second trimester) association between typical sleep duration in pregnancy and subsequent risk of gestational diabetes, as well as the influence of compensatory daytime napping on this association.
   STUDY DESIGN: In the prospective, multiracial Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort, 2581 pregnant women reported their typical sleep duration and napping frequency in the first and second trimesters. Diagnosis of gestational diabetes (n = 107; 4.1%) was based on medical records review. Adjusted relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for gestational diabetes were estimated with Poisson regression, adjusting for demographics, prepregnancy body mass index, and other risk factors.
   RESULTS: From the first and second trimester, sleep duration and napping frequency declined. Sleeping duration in the second but not first trimester was significantly related to risk of gestational diabetes. The association between second-trimester sleep and gestational diabetes differed by prepregnancy obesity status (P for interaction = .04). Among nonobese but not obese women, both sleeping >8-9 hours or <8-9 hours were significantly related to risk of gestational diabetes: 5-6 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-4.99); 7 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.68); or >= 10 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.67). Significant effect modification by napping frequency was also observed in the second trimester (P for interaction = .03). Significant and positive association between reduced sleep (5-7 hours) and gestational diabetes was observed among women napping rarely/never (adjusted relative risk, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.13), whereas no comparable associations were observed among women napping most/sometimes.
   CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a U-shaped association between sleep duration and gestational diabetes, and that napping and prepregnancy obesity status may modify this association.

AB Objective: To examine the frequency of physical and emotional health problems associated with labor and their relationship with self-rated health measures. Methods: Four hundred women were enrolled. Data collection was accomplished through the completion of a form on sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics, a questionnaire that measured the self-rated health level as well as physical health problems, and Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale. Results: Most commonly reported health problems in the initial six-week period were fatigue (77.5%), sleep disturbance (76.0%), and dysuria (61.3%). At one-year postpartum, fatigue (33.9%), sleep disturbance (32.8%) and constipation (15.5%) were the most commonly reported complaints. Those who self-reported a poor health at six weeks and one year comprised of 40.0% and 19.8% of the participants, respectively. Conclusion: Further studies in other populations are warranted to better delineate the prevalence rates, which will provide useful data for developing policies aimed at improving postpartum care.

AB Aim: Guidance on reducing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) was successfully introduced to a number of countries in the early 1990s. The most important recommendations were supine sleeping for infants and non-smoking for mothers. This 2012-2014 study examined adherence to the national Swedish SIDS advice.
   Methods: We asked 1000 parents with infants registered at child healthcare centres in western Sweden to complete a questionnaire on infant care from birth to 12 months of age.
   Results: We analysed 710 responses and found that, in the first three months, 1.3% of the infants were placed in the prone sleeping position and 14.3% were placed on their side. By three to five months, this had risen to 5.6% and 23.6%. In the first three months, 83.1% were breastfed, 84.1% used a pacifier and 44.2% shared their parents' bed, while 5.8% slept in another room. Bed sharing was more likely if infants were breastfed and less likely if they used pacifiers. During pregnancy, 2.8% of the mothers smoked and the mothers who had smoked during pregnancy were less likely to bed share.
   Conclusion: Overall adherence to the SIDS advice was good, but both prone and side sleeping practices should be targeted.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) is estimated to affect one in twenty people worldwide. MDD is highly comorbid with cardiovascular disease (CVD), itself one of the single largest causes of mortality worldwide. A number of pathological changes observed in MDD are believed to contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease, although no single mechanism has been identified. There are also no biological markers capable of predicting the future risk of developing heart disease in depressed individuals. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a prothrombotic plasma protein secreted by endothelial tissue and has long been implicated in CVD. An expanding body of literature has recently implicated it in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder as well. In this study, we review candidate pathways implicating MDD in CVD and consider how PAI-1 might act as a mediator by which MDD induces CVD development: chiefly through sleep disruption, adiposity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) metabolism, systemic inflammation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis dysregulation. As both MDD and CVD are more prevalent in women than in men, and incidence of either condition is dramatically increased during reproductive milestones, we also explore hormonal and sex-specific associations between MDD, PAI-1 and CVD. Of special interest is the role PAI-1 plays in perinatal depression and in cardiovascular complications of pregnancy. Finally, we propose a theoretical model whereby PAI-1 might serve as a useful biomarker for CVD risk in those with depression, and as a potential target for future treatments.

AB Prenatal psychosocial health has been linked with health behaviors, maternal health, and birth outcomes. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of a prenatal depression intervention on birth outcomes and maternal physical and psychological status at 42 days postpartum. Three hundred fifty-two high-risk pregnant women exposed to obstetric complications with an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) >= 9 or a Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) >= 60 were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 176) and control group (n = 176). The intervention group underwent a six-session couple-separated psycho-educational program; the control group received the usual care. All participants were asked to complete questionnaires at late pregnancy (> 28 weeks), 3 days postpartum, and 42 days postpartum. The intervention group had a significantly lower cesarean rate and shorter third stage of labor (p < .05). At 42 days after delivery, only 5.1% of participants were lost to follow-up, and the intervention group had significantly less minor and major depression, more sleep time, more satisfaction with their husband and other family members, less concern about taking care of baby, and less breast milk insufficiency than the control group (p < .05). A prenatal psychological intervention model for high-risk pregnant women holds potential as a preventive program that addresses maternal health and birth outcomes.

AB Antidepressants are commonly recommended for prevention of postpartum depression; however, there is a lack of clarity about their role in the reduction of postpartum recurrences. Surprisingly, there are only two randomized controlled trials, one open trial, and one prospective cohort study on the subject. Evidence in support of the use of antidepressants is limited to a study of only 22 women. Due to the paucity of extant literature, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the prophylactic efficacy of antidepressants.

AB Maternal metabolic adaptations are essential for successful pregnancy outcomes. We investigated how metabolic gestational processes are coordinated, whether there is a functional linkwithinternal clocks, andwhether disruptions are related to metabolic abnormalities in pregnancy, by studying day/night metabolic pathways in murine models and samples from pregnant women with normally grown and large-for-gestational age infants. In early mouse pregnancy, expression of hepatic lipogenic genes was up-regulated and uncoupled from the hepatic clock. In latemouse pregnancy, rhythmicity of energymetabolism-relatedgenes inthemuscle followed the patterns of internal clock genes in this tissue, and coincided with enhanced lipid transporter expression in the fetoplacental unit. Diurnal triglyceride patterns were disrupted in human placentas from pregnancies with large-for-gestational age infants and this overlapped with an increase in BMAL1 expression. Metabolic adaptations in early pregnancy are uncoupled fromthe circadian clock, whereas in late pregnancy, energy availability is mediated by coordinated muscle-placenta metabolic adjustments linked to internal clocks. Placental triglyceride oscillations in the third trimester of human pregnancy are lost in large-for-gestational age infants and may be regulated by BMAL1. In summary, disruptions in metabolic and circadian rhythmicity are associated with increased fetal size, with implications for the pathogenesis of macrosomia.-Papacleovoulou, G., Nikolova, V., Oduwole, O., Chambers, J., Vazquez-Lopez, M., Jansen, E., Nicolaides, K., Parker, M., Williamson, C.

AB Sleep disorders are a common problem during pregnancy and may affect quality of life. This study aimed to determine the status of sleep quality and its relationship with quality of life in Iranian pregnant women. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 565 women recruited using 2-stage cluster sampling methods. Data were collected using sociodemographic characteristics; quality of life; and Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire between March and May 2015. About 6% of the women had a sleep disorder. There were significant correlations between quality of life and total score of sleep quality, subdomains of habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction. Paying attention to the sleep quality as an effective factor of quality of life can promote sleep quality and hence quality of life of pregnant women.

AB Background. Late gestational sleep fragmentation (SF) is highly prevalent particularly in obese women, and induces metabolic dysfunction in adult offspring mice. SF induces activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), which might be involved in metabolic disorders. We hypothesized that adult offspring of double mutant mice (DM) involving the critical ISR genes CHOP and GADD34 would be protected from developing obesity and insulin resistance following SF.
   Methods. Time-pregnant CHOP/GADD34 DM and wild type (WT) mice were randomly assigned to sleep control (SC) or SF conditions during the last 5 days of gestation. At 24-weeks of age, body weight, fat mass, and HOMA-IR were assessed in the offspring. Tregs lymphocytes, Lyc6c(high), M1 and M2 macrophages were examined in visceral white adipose tissues (vWAT) using flow cytometry. The effects of plasma exosomes on adipocyte cell line proliferation, differentiation and insulin sensitivity were also evaluated.
   Results. SF-WT male showed significant increases in body weight, vWAT mass and HOMA-IR compared to SC-WT mice, while SF had no effect in SF-DM mice. Inflammatory macrophages (Ly-6c(high)) and the ratio of MI/M2 macrophages were increased while FoxP3+ Tregs counts were decreased in SF-WT but not in SF-DM mice. Exosomes from SF-WT, but not from the SF-DM offspring increased pre-adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, and decreased in vitro adipocyte insulin sensitivity.
   Conclusion. Activation of the ISR during late gestation, as induced by late gestational SF, appears to underlie some of the transgenerational modifications in metabolic genes ultimately contributing to a metabolic syndrome phenotype in adult offspring. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Artificial milk supplementation remains a popular practice in spite of the well documented and indisputable advantages of breast feeding for both mother and child. However, the association between maternal sleep, fatigue and feeding method is understudied and remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate whether perceived sleep and fatigue differ between breast-and bottle feeding post partum women. In addition, the relationship between subjective sleep characteristics and fatigue is examined.
   Methods: Post partum women (four to 16 weeks) filled out a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS).
   Findings: Sixty-one within the past week exclusively breast-and 44 exclusively bottle-feeding mothers were included. The first group showed better subjective sleep quality, but lower habitual sleep efficiency as measured by the PSQI. Global PSQI, as well as subjective fatigue and global CIS, did not differ between the two groups. Significant positive correlations were found between global CIS and the number of night feeds and global PSQI. However, only global PSQI significantly predicted global CIS in relation to the number of night feeds.
   Conclusions: Within a general pattern of deteriorated sleep quality, breast-feeding women showed better subjective sleep quality, but lower habitual sleep efficiency, between four and fourteen weeks after childbirth. However, the PSQI component scores compensated for each other, resulting in absence of any difference in global PSQI sleep quality between the two groups. Global PSQI significantly predicted global CIS, resulting in an absence of any difference in post partum fatigue according to feeding method.
   Implications for practice: Midwives and nurses should, together with the parents, continue to focus on exploring ways to improve maternal sleep quality and to reduce postnatal fatigue.

AB Postpartum sleep and fatigue have bidirectional relationships with depressive symptoms and challenge women's everyday functioning. The everyday process of managing postpartum sleep and fatigue in the context of depressive symptoms remains unexplored. We conducted a grounded theory study with a sample of 19 women who screened positive on the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) Short Form at 3 weeks postpartum. Women completed semi-structured in-home interviews and the full PDSS and Modified Fatigue Symptoms Checklist at 1, 3, and 6 months postpartum. The sample was on average 27 years old, with 2.8 children, and 63% were African-American. They described a basic social process of Finding a Routine Together, during which women's experiences with their infants progressed from Retreating at month 1 toward Finding a New Normal at month 6. In their work to Find a Routine Together, mothers' patterns of change over time were continuous, gradual, or prolonged. Their progress was influenced by depressive symptoms, social support, work and daycare, stability in social circumstances, and underlying stressors. This study's findings suggest the need to allocate resources and tailor interventions to meet the needs of women who are most vulnerable to the health effects of ongoing persistent severe fatigue, disordered sleep, and sub-clinical and clinical levels of depressive symptoms.

AB Cell transfer between mother and fetus were demonstrated previously in several species which possess haemochorial placenta (e.g. in humans, mice, rats, etc.). Here we report the assessment of fetal and maternal microchimerism in non-transgenic (non-TG) New Zealand white rabbits which were pregnant with transgenic (TG) fetuses and in non-TG newborns of TG does. The TG construct, including the Venus fluorophore cDNA driven by a ubiquitous cytomegalovirus enhancer, chicken -actin promoter (CAGGS), was previously integrated into the rabbit genome by Sleeping Beauty transposon system. Three different methods [fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR)] were employed to search for TG cells and gene products in blood and other tissues of non-TG rabbits. Venus positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were not detected in the blood of non-TG littermates or non-TG does by flow cytometry. Tissue samples (liver, kidney, skeletal and heart muscle) also proved to be Venus negative examined with fluorescence microscopy, while histology sections and PBMCs of TG rabbits showed robust Venus protein expression. In case of genomic DNA (gDNA) sourced from tissue samples of non-TG rabbits, CAGGS promoter-specific fragments could not be amplified by QPCR. Our data showed the lack of detectable cell transfer between TG and non-TG rabbits during gestation.

AB Objectives: Many anatomic and physiologic changes occur in women's bodies during pregnancy that make them vulnerable both physically and mentally. Depression is a common disorder that can be accompanied with obstetric, neonatal and postnatal complications. This study aimed to determine the relationship between depression and sleep quality among pregnant women in Tabriz- Iran, 2014.
   Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 565 pregnant women who referred to Tabriz health centers by 2-stage cluster sampling. The data were collected using socio-demographic questionnaire, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). General linear model was used in order to estimate the effect of independent variables (sleep quality and socio-demographic characteristics) on dependent variable (depression).
   Results: The mean (SD) of sleep quality score was 3.6 (1.4) from possible score range of 0-21 and the mean (SD) of depression score was 4.7 (3.7) from attainable score of 0-30. A significant correlation was found between depression score and total score of sleep quality and all its sub-domains except delay in sleeping. Also, according to adjusted general linear model, the variables of sleep quality, age, marital relationship, satisfaction of husband job, place of residence and place of receiving prenatal care were predictors of depression.
   Conclusion: Considering that the relationship between depression and sleep quality in pregnant women and also maternal and neonatal complications of depression, sleep hygiene education will be necessary in order to improve the quality and quantity of mothers sleep.

AB Background. Daily rhythmicity has been observed for a number of hormonal and behavioral variables in mammals. It can be entrained by several external factors, such as light-dark cycle and scheduled feeding. In dromedary camels, daily rhythmicity has been documented only for melatonin secretion and body temperature. In this study, the daily rhythmicity of behavioral repertoire, cortisol and testosterone levels was investigated in captive male camels.
   Methods. Six clinically healthy male dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) were used. The animals were housed in single boxes for 24 h daily and fed twice a day. Over a period of 48 h, behavioral observations were made and blood samples taken every two hours. The data were analyzed using diurnality index, conisor analysis and PROC mixed procedure.
   Results. The diurnality index for rumination and lying down was close to 0 (respectively, 0.09 and 0.19), while the indices for stereotypy, standing, feeding and walking were close to 1 (respectively, 0.74, 0.84, 0.92 and 0.85). Cosinor analysis revealed daily rhythmicity for all behaviors and for cortisol levels (acrophase at 12: 57) but not for testosterone. Rumination and lying down (inactive behaviors) reached a peak during the scotophase, whereas feeding, walking and stereotypy (active behaviors) reached a peak during the photophase around midday. Cortisol level and expression of stereotypies peaked before and after food distribution and were negatively correlated (r = -0.287, P = 0.005). Testosterone levels and expression of sexual behaviors were stimulated by the visual and olfactory contacts with the females and were positively correlated (r = 0.164, P = 0.040). Testosterone was also negatively correlated with cortisol (r = -0.297; P = 0.003).
   Discussion. These preliminary results provided new knowledge about the daily rhythm of behaviors in camels housed in boxes, suggesting that camels exhibit diurnal behavior pattern in the maintenance conditions outlined in the study. Daily rhythmicity seemed to be entrained not only by the light-dark cycle but also by scheduled feeding. The rise in stereotypy after food distribution could be due to the persistence of feeding motivation and frustration after the ingestion of food. Therefore, feeding practices should be improved to satisfy the foraging and feeding motivation of these camels. Behavioral and hormonal daily patterns in camels should be taken in consideration to adapt the management system, giving the animals more freedom during the light period and a diet richer in fiber, so as to improve reproductive performance, health and welfare.

AB Human sleep-wake cycles are entrained by both natural and artificial light-dark cycles. However, little is known regarding when and how the photoperiod changes entrain the biological clock after conception. To investigate the dependence of sleep patterns in young infants on the natural and artificial light-dark cycles, 1,302 pairs of one-month-old infants and their mothers were asked to answer a questionnaire. Birth in spring, longer daytime sleep duration, early/regular light-off times, and longer maternal nighttime sleep duration were identified as independent variables for longer infant nighttime sleep duration in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Longer maternal nighttime sleep duration was dependent on shorter naps and early/regular bed times but not on the season. We found that nighttime sleep duration depended on both natural and artificial diurnal photoperiod changes in one-month-old infants. Although sleep patterns of infants mimicked those of their mothers, nighttime sleep duration depended on the season, and was positively associated with daytime sleep duration, only in the infants. These specific variables, which render sleep patterns of the infants different from those of their mothers, might be a clue to reveal the covert acquisition process of mature circadian rhythms after birth.

DE model; logistic regression; malaria; pregnant women
AB Malaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite called Plasmodium. It has been the main concern of health problem in Indonesia, especially to the high-risk groups; the infants, under-five-years-old children and pregnant women. If a pregnant woman is infected to malaria, it might affect the pregnancy and cause abnormalities to the baby. This analysis is aimed to determine the factors associated with malaria among pregnant women in Indonesia. The data which used for this research is taken from National Basic Health research (Riskesdas) 2013 and the samples are all of pregnant women who'schosen as the respondents in Riskesdas 2013. The data was analyzed using binary logistic regression analysis and backward elimination method. The result shows that the factors associated with malaria among pregnant women in Indonesia are health monitoring of pregnant women by midwives which implemented in the possessing of KIA book, the usage of electric/coil mosquito repellent when sleeping in the night, the economic status, and the presence of midwives/maternity hospital. The lower the economic status of pregnant women, the higher the risk they tend to get infected with malaria. Pregnant women are advised to check their health status routinely and avoid contact with the vectors of malaria, by using mosquito repellent at night.

AB The cardiovascular parameters of canine bitches were assessed during the estrous cycle. A total of eleven mongrel female dogs were enrolled in a longitudinal prospective investigation. Six animals were bred during the study and were assigned into group I, in which evaluations were performed during proestrus, estrus, gestational diestrus and anestrus. The five remaining bitches were not bred and underwent evaluations during proestrus, estrus, nongestational diestrus and anestrus. The holter data showed a gradual increase in the minimum and mean heart rate along pregnancy, as well as a reduction during anestrus, which differed significantly among the distinct periods. The values for maximal heart rate documented during pregnancy were significantly lower than those recorded during anestrus, and a variation in the heart rate circadian rhythm was also found, as demonstrated by decreases at night and rises during the day. Cardiac rhythm had a similar performance in both pregnancy and anestrus. Likewise, the blood pressure, electrocardiography, and echocardiography data did not vary during the estrous cycle. The results support the role played by the autonomic nervous system during these two distinct periods in order to attain a heart rate that provides the blood needed by the female's body during the various stages of the reproductive cycle. Further studies are needed to better clarify the cardiovascular compensatory neuroendocrine events that accompany gestation in this species.

AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in non obstetrical and obstetrical patients.
   Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of OSA and its relationship with pregnancy-related complications in a general obstetric population of Department of Defense beneficiaries receiving direct-care at military treatment facilities.
   Study design: A retrospective cohort study of all women (N = 305,001) who gave birth at a military treatment facility from 2008 to 2014. OSA cases were randomly selected and matched on age (3:1 ratio) to non OSA cases. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes (cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, postoperative wound complications, hospital stay greater than five days, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, preterm delivery, poor fetal growth, and stillbirth) between pregnant women with and without a diagnosis of OSA. Cases were identified using ICD-9 codes, while controlling for demographics, obesity, and medical comorbidities associated with OSA and the outcomes of interest.
   Results: We identified 266 cases of OSA (OSA rate = 8.7 per 10,000; increased from 6.4 to 9.9 per 10,000 from 2009 to 2013). OSA was associated with a higher odds of cesarean delivery (AOR,1.60; 95% CI, 1.062.40), gestational hypertension, (AOR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.30-4.68), preeclampsia (AOR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.43-4.09), and preterm delivery (AOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.09-3.30).
   Conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objective: To examine if insomnia before and after childbirth predicts the development of postpartum bodily pain.
   Methods: This study is part of a longitudinal cohort study, the Akershus Birth Cohort Study, which targeted all women giving birth at Akershus, University Hospital in Norway. The current sample is comprised of 1480 women who participated at all three time points, yielding a participation rate of 32% of the 4662 women who originally consented to participate. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) was used to measure insomnia and a latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to identify subsets of women who shared a similar pattern of responses on the BIS-scale across the three time points. Pain was measured using the bodily pain scale, derived from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) and symptoms of depression were measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).
   Results: Using a latent profile analysis a three class model showed the best fit and identified one major group (55.6%) with a low BIS scores across all three time points, one group with intermediate BIS scores (32.9%), and a smaller group (11.5%) with higher BIS scores across all three times. The chronic high insomnia group had a 2.8-fold increased risk of reporting high levels of bodily pain. The chronic intermediate group was associated with a 2.2-fold increased risk of bodily pain at two years postpartum. Adjusting for demographics and lifestyle behaviors did not reduce any of the associations, while adjusting for depression significantly attenuated the associations. Additional adjustment for pain at eight weeks postpartum further reduced the magnitude of the associations, but both chronic intermediate insomnia and chronic high insomnia remained strongly associated with the onset of bodily pain in the fully adjusted models (RR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.37-2.23) and RR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.15-2.32, respectively).
   Conclusions: The high prevalence of insomnia among women during and after childbirth, in combination with the strong prospective association with impaired physical health, emphasizes the importance of adequately identifying, preventing and treating insomnia for this population.

AB Introduction: By the time children start school, inequities in learning, development and health outcomes are already evident. Sustained nurse home visiting (SNHV) offers a potential platform for families experiencing adversity, who often have limited access to services. While SNHV programmes have been growing in popularity in Australia and internationally, it is not known whether they can improve children's learning and development when offered via the Australian service system. The right@ home trial aims to investigate the effectiveness of an SNHV programme, offered to women from pregnancy to child age 2 years, in improving parent care of and responsivity to the child, and the home learning environment.
   Methods and analysis: Pregnant Australian women (n=722) are identified after completing a screening survey of 10 factors known to predict children's learning and development (eg, young pregnancy, poor mental or physical health, lack of support). Consenting women-surveyed while attending clinics at 10 hospitals in Victoria and Tasmania-are enrolled if they report having 2 or more risk factors. The intervention comprises 25 home visits from pregnancy to 2 years, focusing on parent care of the child, responsivity to the child and providing a good quality home learning environment. The standard, universal, Australian child and family health service provides the comparator (control). Primary outcome measures include a combination of parent-reported and objective assessments of children's sleep, safety, nutrition, parenting styles and the home learning environment, including the Home Observation of the Environment Inventory and items adapted from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children.

AB Objectives Infant developmental outcomes may be influenced by a range of prenatal maternal characteristics. While there is some evidence to suggest that maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, there is a need to systematically review this evidence to guide future research and clinical practice. Methods Five electronic databases were systematically scanned. Key journals and reference lists were hand-searched. Papers were included if: (1) pregnant women were assessed for maternal-foetal attachment; (2) the infants were later assessed, under 2 years old, for any developmental outcome (e.g., social-emotional, cognition, motor, language, adaptive behaviour); and (3) they were published in English. Two independent reviewers used the STROBE checklist to appraise the quality of each paper. Results Of the 968 papers identified, eight were included in the review, and four of these were of low quality (< 60 %) based on the STROBE. The developmental domains that were examined included: infant temperament (n = 5), adaptive behaviour (e.g., colic, sleep) (n = 2), and milestone attainment (n = 1). There is some evidence to suggest that lower maternal-foetal attachment is related to suboptimal developmental outcomes. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited and low quality studies available. Conclusions Although maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, future research is required which: (1) considers a range of developmental outcomes, (2) has increased scientific rigour, (3) assesses mother-infant dyads at different prenatal and postnatal time points, and (4) examines different target populations.

AB Preconception health refers to the health of males and females at any point in time prior to a potential pregnancy. A goal of preconception health research is to use preventive behaviour and healthcare to optimize the health of future offspring that result from both planned and unplanned pregnancies. This paper briefly reviews evidence of the importance of various preconception health behaviours, and examines the extent to which specific preconception health behaviours have been included in recent studies of such knowledge, behaviours, and intentions. To describe this recent research in highly developed countries, a scoping review of the literature was completed of studies published within the past seven years. A total of 94 studies on preconception health were identified and reviewed: (a) 15 examined knowledge and attitudes, (b) 68 studied behaviours, (c) 18 examined interventions designed to improve knowledge or behaviour, and (d) no studies examined intentions to engage in preconception health behaviours. Over 40% of studies examining preconception health behaviour focussed exclusively on folic acid. Overall, folic acid, alcohol, and cigarettes have consistently been topics of focus, while exposure to harmful environmental substances, stress, and sleep have been largely neglected. Despite strong evidence for the importance of men's health during the preconception period, only 11% of all studies included male participants. Based on existing gaps in the research, recommendations are provided, such as including men in future research, assessing a wider variety of behaviours, consideration of behavioural intentions, and consideration of the relationships between preconception health knowledge, intentions, and behaviour.

AB Introduction: The aim of this article is to investigate the determinants of sleeping patterns in children up to age 9 on a large and geographically homogeneous sample of British children and parents, focusing in particular on the role of economic and social factors, specifically on income.
   Aims and Methods: The data of this study come from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a long-term health research project that recruited over 14 000 pregnant women who were due to give birth between April 1991 and December 1992 in Bristol and its surrounding areas, including some of Somerset and Gloucestershire. Logistic regression models for the sleep problem dummies and log-linear models for the sleep quantity.
   Results: One additional item in the material deprivation index is associated to an increase of around 10-20% in the odds of having at least 1 sleep problem. Similarly, children from the richest families are less likely to have any sleep problem up to 115 months (around 20% reduction in the odds). Mother's characteristics (i.e., education and mental health in the pregnancy period) are also significant predictors. Sleep quantity does not vary much and is not sensitive to socioeconomic factors.
   Conclusion: Exposure to income-related inequalities affects child sleep. Further research is needed to understand if sleep in early life influences future health and economic trajectories.

DE plagiocephaly; positional skull deformity; brachycephaly; cranial;

ID HELMET THERAPY; DEFORMATION; MANAGEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE Following institution of the Back to Sleep Campaign, the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome decreased while the prevalence of positional skull deformation increased dramatically. The management of positional deformity is controversial, and treatment recommendations and outcomes reporting are variable. The authors reviewed their institutional experience (2008-2014) with the treatment of positional plagiocephaly to explore factors associated with measured improvement.
   METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted with risk factors and treatment for positional head shape deformity recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the impact of these variables on the change in measured oblique diagonal difference (ODD) on head shape surface scanning pre-and posttreatment.
   RESULTS A total of 991 infants aged less than 1 year were evaluated for cranial positional deformity in a dedicated clinical program. The most common deformity was occipital plagiocephaly (69.5%), followed by occipital brachycephaly (18.4%) or a combination of both deformities (12.1%). Recommended treatment included repositioning (RP), physical therapy (PT) if indicated, or orthotic treatment with a customized cranial orthosis (CO) according to an age-and risk factor dependent algorithm that the authors developed for this clinic. Of the 991 eligible patients, 884 returned for at least 1 follow-up appointment. A total of 552 patients were followed to completion of their treatment and had a full set of records for analysis: these patients had pre-and posttreatment 2D surface scanner evaluations. The average presenting age was 6.2 months (corrected for prematurity for treatment considerations). Of the 991 patients, 543 (54.8%) had RP or PT as first recommended treatment. Of these 543 patients, 137 (25.2%) transitioned to helmet therapy after the condition did not improve over 4-8 weeks. In the remaining cases, RP/PT had already failed before the patients were seen in this program, and the starting treatment recommendation was CO. At the end of treatment, the measured improvements in ODD were 36.7%, 33.5%, and 15.1% for patients receiving CO, RP/PT/CO, and RP/PT, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that sex, race, insurance, diagnosis, sleep position preference, torticollis history, and multiple gestation were not significantly associated with magnitude of ODD change during treatment. On multivariate analysis, corrected age at presentation and type of treatment received were significantly associated with magnitude of ODD change. Orthotic treatment corresponded with the largest ODD change, while the RP/PT group had the least change in ODD. Earlier age at presentation corresponded with larger ODD change.
   CONCLUSIONS Earlier age at presentation and type of treatment impact the degree of measured deformational head shape correction in positional plagiocephaly. This retrospective study suggests that treatment with a custom CO can result in more improvement in objective measurements of head shape.

   INTERVENTION; OVERWEIGHT; BEHAVIORS; PATTERNS; IMPACT; PERCEPTIONS;

AB OBJECTIVE: The few existing early-life obesity prevention initiatives have concentrated on abstract nutrition and physical activity, with little examination of sleep.
   METHODS: This community-based, randomized controlled trial allocated 802 pregnant women (>= 16 years, <34 weeks' gestation) to: control, FAB (food, activity, and breastfeeding), sleep, or combination (both interventions) groups. All groups received standard well-child care. FAB participants received additional support (8 contacts) promoting breastfeeding, healthy eating, and physical activity (antenatal-18 months). Sleep participants received 2 sessions (antenatal, 3 weeks) targeting prevention of sleep problems, as well as a sleep treatment program if requested (6-24 months). Combination participants received both interventions (9 contacts). BMI was measured at 24 months by researchers blinded to group allocation, and secondary outcomes (diet, physical activity, sleep) were assessed by using a questionnaire or accelerometry at multiple time points.
   RESULTS: At 2 years, 686 women remained in the study (86%). No significant intervention effect was observed for BMI at 24 months (P =.086), but there was an overall group effect for the prevalence of obesity (P =.027). Exploratory analyses found a protective effect for obesity among those receiving the " sleep intervention" (sleep and combination compared with FAB and control: odds ratio, 0.54 [95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.82]). No effect was observed for the " FAB intervention" (FAB and combination compared with sleep and control: odds ratio, 1.20 [95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.81]).
   CONCLUSIONS: A well-developed food and activity intervention did not seem to affect children's weight status. However, further research on more intensive or longer running sleep interventions is warranted.

   The aim of the study was to compare parameters of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in women of childbearing age with and without a diagnosis of PCOS. Cross-sectional study using a questionnaire containing demographic information, symptoms related to PMS, anthropometric data, food consumption and dichotomized clinical diagnosis of PCOS. The results were tabulated in Microsoft Excel((R)) in SPSS 20.0. The research involved the participation of 42 university students, randomly selected, with an average age of 25.29 +/- observed 6.56 years. According to the body mass index 71.4% (n = 30) were eutrophic. As the presence of diagnostic SOP 50% (9n = 21) had the syndrome and 71.4% (n = 30) of these reported using oral contraceptive. It is observed in the study, statistical significance (p < 0.05) between the dissatisfaction of body image of university with and without PCOS, which is greater dissatisfaction among those without PCOS. During the menstrual period there was greater consumption of cereals (95.5%), fats (71.4%) and chocolate (52.4%) by participants who have PCOS and cereals (90.5%), vegetables (66.7%) and fat (61.9%) consumed by the university without PCOS. Note a positive relationship in the presence of common symptoms of PCOS that produces depression, emotional instability, difficulty concentrating, headaches, edema and increased sleep. Besides a greater consumption of food especially more caloric food as chocolate.

AB Purpose To gain further understanding of the general medical comorbidity of binge eating disorder (BED) beyond its association with obesity.
   Method We reviewed studies of general medical comorbidity in people with BED or clinically significant binge eating behavior beyond obesity. We also reviewed studies of BED in specific medical conditions.
   Results Three broad study categories of medical comorbidity in BED were found: cross-sectional studies of medical conditions in BED; prospective studies of medical conditions in BED; and studies of BED in specific medical conditions. Cross-sectional epidemiologic data suggest that BED is associated with medical conditions related to obesity, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, sleep problems/disorders, and pain conditions, and that BED may be related to these conditions independent of obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Prospective data suggest that BED may be associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. BED or binge eating behavior is also associated with asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders, and among women, menstrual dysfunction, pregnancy complications, intracranial hypertension, and polycystic ovary syndrome.
   Conclusions BED is associated with substantial medical comorbidity beyond obesity. Further study of the general medical comorbidity of BED and its relationship to obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders is greatly needed.

ID UPPER AIRWAY; RESPIRATORY CONTROL; MEDROXYPROGESTERONE; SYMPTOMS;
   HYPOXIA; LEPTIN; RISK
AB Background: Pregnancy is a risk factor for sleep disordered breathing, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Progesterone, one of the key hormones in pregnancy, a known respiratory drive stimulant, increases ventilation and may protect against OSA. We aimed to examine the relationship between circulating progesterone and OSA, after accounting for body weight and gestational age.
   Methods: A case control study was conducted of pregnant women with OSA and those at low risk for the disorder. Cases were identified by ICD-9 code and review of medical record. Controls were identified if they scored zero (never) for snoring, apnea, and gasping on the multivariable apnea prediction index questionnaire immediately following delivery. Subjects with available stored first and/or second trimester residual serum samples were then included in this study and serum analyzed for progesterone. Raw progesterone levels were adjusted for the effects of gestational age and maternal weight.
   Results: Twenty-seven cases and 64 controls with available serum were identified. Women with OSA had greater maternal weight and higher rates of related comorbidities, compared to controls. Progesterone levels correlated positively with gestational age and negatively with greater weight. Progesterone levels, adjusted for gestational age and maternal weight and expressed as multiples of median (MoM), were significantly lower in OSA cases compared to controls in both the first trimester (MoM= 0.71, confidence interval [95% CI] 0.60-0.83) relative to the MoM in controls of 1.00. In the second trimester levels were also lower in OSA cases (MoM= 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.96) compared to the MoM of 1.00 in controls.
   Conclusions: Progesterone levels, after accounting for weight and gestational age, were lower in women with OSA than controls. Progesterone may play a protective role against OSA.

AB Background: Preterm delivery may affect the development of the upper airways resulting in a higher risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). We investigated whether children born at early term (37-38 6/7 weeks' gestation) are at an increased risk for childhood OSA as compared with those born later.
   Methods: In this population-based cohort analysis all singleton deliveries occurring between 1991-2013 at a single regional tertiary medical centre were included. Gestational age upon delivery was sub-divided into: early preterm (< 33 6/7 weeks' gestation), late preterm (34-36 6/7), early term, full term (39-40 6/7), late term (41-41 6/7), and post term (> 42 0/7). Incidence of OSA related hospitalizations of the offspring, up to the age of 18 years, was evaluated. A survival curve and a Cox model were used to assess the association.
   Results: During the study period 240 953 deliveries met the inclusion criteria. OSA hospitalization (n = 1320) rates decreased as gestational age increased from 1.1% in the early preterm group, 0.8% in late preterm, 0.7% at early term, 0.5% in full term, 0.4% in late term, to 0.3% in post term born children. In the Cox regression, early term delivery exhibited an increased risk for paediatric OSA (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.3 95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.5) while late and post term deliveries were associated with significantly lower OSA risk when compared with full term (HR 0.8 95% CI 0.6, 0.9 and HR 0.6 95% CI 0.4, 0.8, respectively).
   Conclusions: Early term deliveries are associated with higher rates of paediatric OSA, which decrease gradually as gestational age advances.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) may have a role in persistent breeding-induced endometritis in mares through an inhibitory effect on uterine contractility. The objectives of this study were to test the effect of NO on spontaneous uterine contractility in-vitro and to evaluate whether this effect varied between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers of the uterus. Reproductive tracts were collected from eight euthanized non-pregnant mares (age 4-19 years; body weight 405-530 kg). Transrectal examination of the reproductive tract was performed before euthanasia to evaluate stage of the estrous cycle and presence of any apparent abnormality. After euthanasia, one uterine tissue sample was collected for histological evaluation and four full-thickness uterine tissue strips (10-12 mm x 2 mm), two parallel to each muscle layer, were excised for in-vitro contractility evaluation. Strips were suspended in tissue chambers containing Krebs Henseleit solution, with continuous aeration (95% 02-5% CO2; pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C. After equilibration, spontaneous contractility was recorded (pre-treatment) and strips excised in each direction were randomly allocated to each of two groups: 1) SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, an NO donor); or 2) NAP (N-acetyl-o-penicillamine, vehicle and time-matched control). These were treated at 15 min intervals with increasing concentrations (10(-7) M to 10(-3) M) of SNAP and NAP, respectively. Contractility data was recorded throughout the experiment. An interaction effect of group by -concentration was observed (P < 0.0001). The mean contractility after treatment with 10(-4) M and 10(-3) M SNAP were significantly lower than the pre-treatment contractility and the mean contractility after treatment with lower SNAP concentrations. In contrast, contractility did not change significantly in the NAP treated controls. The effect of treatment on uterine contractility was not influenced by age or weight of the mare, stage of estrous cycle, uterine histology grade, or muscle layer. Secondary findings included significant main effects of stage of estrous cycle (increased contractility in estrus compared to diestrus), uterine histology grade (decreased contractility in grade IIB compared to grade I) and age (decreased contractility in mares aged > 8 years compared to mares aged <= 8 years). In conclusion, results of this study indicate that NO has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on spontaneous uterine contractility irrespective of the muscle layer in the mare. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective To assess the association between maternal birth country and adherence to the American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep recommendations in a national sample of Hispanic mothers, given that data assessing the heterogeneity of infant care practices among Hispanics are lacking.
   Study design We used a stratified, 2-stage, clustered design to obtain a nationally representative sample of mothers from 32 US intrapartum hospitals. A total of 907 completed follow-up surveys (administered 2-6 months postpartum) were received from mothers who self-identified as Hispanic/Latina, forming our sample, which we divided into 4 subpopulations by birth country (US, Mexico, Central/South America, and Caribbean). Prevalence estimates and aORs were determined for infant sleep position, location, breastfeeding, and maternal smoking.
   Results When compared with US-born mothers, we found that mothers born in the Caribbean (aOR 4.56) and Central/South America (aOR 2.68) were significantly more likely to room share without bed sharing. Caribbean-born mothers were significantly less likely to place infants to sleep supine (aOR 0.41). Mothers born in Mexico (aOR 1.67) and Central/South America (aOR 2.57) were significantly more likely to exclusively breastfeed; Caribbean-born mothers (aOR 0.13) were significantly less likely to do so. Foreign-born mothers were significantly less likely to smoke before and during pregnancy.
   Conclusions Among US Hispanics, adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep recommendations varies widely by maternal birth country. These data illustrate the importance of examining behavioral heterogeneity among ethnic groups and have potential relevance for developing targeted interventions for safe infant sleep.

AB BACKGROUND: Neuraxial morphine is the most commonly used analgesic technique after cesarean delivery. The incidence of respiratory depression is reported to be very low (0%-1.2%) in this patient population as measured by pulse oximetry and respiratory rates. However, hypercapnia may be a more sensitive measure of respiratory depression. In the current study, the incidence of hypercapnia events (transcutaneous CO2 [TcCO2] >50 mm Hg) for >= 2-minute duration was evaluated using the Topological Oscillation Search with Kinematical Analysis monitor in women who received intrathecal morphine for postcesarean delivery analgesia.
   METHODS: Healthy women (>37 weeks of gestation) scheduled for a cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine were recruited. Baseline STOP-BANG sleep apnea questionnaire and TcCO2 readings were obtained. Spinal anesthesia was initiated with 12 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine, 15 mu g fentanyl, and 150 mu g morphine. The Topological Oscillation Search with Kinematical Analysis monitor was reapplied in the postanesthesia care unit and TcCO2 measurements obtained for up to 24 hours. Supplemental opioid administration and adverse respiratory events were recorded. The primary outcome was the incidence of hypercapnia events, defined as a TcCO2 reading >50 mm Hg for >= 2 minutes in the first 24 hours after delivery.
   RESULTS: Of the 120 women who were recruited, 108 completed the study. Thirty-five women (32%; 99.15% confidence interval, 21%-45%) reached the primary outcome of a sustained hypercapnia event. The median time (interquartile range [IQR]) from intrathecal morphine administration to the hypercapnia event was 300 (124-691) minutes. The median (IQR) number of events was 3 (1-6) and longest duration of an event was 25.6 (8.4-98.7) minutes. Baseline median (IQR) TcCO2 measurements were 35 (30-0) mm Hg and postoperatively, median (IQR) TcCO2 measurements were 40 (36-43) mm Hg, a difference of 5 mm Hg (99.15% confidence interval of the difference 2-8 mm Hg, P < .001). The incidence of hypercapnia events was 5.4% in women with a baseline TcCO2 value <= 31 mm Hg, 22.5% with a baseline TcCO2 between 32 and 38 mm Hg, and 77.4% with a baseline TcCO2 >38 mm Hg (P < .001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Hypercapnia events (>50 mm Hg for >= 2-minute duration) occurred frequently in women receiving 150 mu g intrathecal morphine for postcesarean analgesia. Higher baseline TcCO2 readings were observed in women who had hypercapnia events.

AB To develop an animal model for studies on peri-partum sleep disorders, sleep patterns in female Wistar rats during pregnancy, post-partum and after weaning, were assessed and associated adaptive changes in their anxiety were examined. Adult nulliparous female rats, maintained in standard laboratory conditions with ad libitum food and water, were surgically implanted with electroencephalogram and electromyogram electrodes under anaesthesia for objective assessment of sleep-wakefulness (S-W). After post-surgical recovery, three control recordings of S-W were taken for 24 h before the animals were kept for mating. After confirmation of pregnancy, S-W recordings were acquired during different days of pregnancy, post-partum lactation/nursing days, and also after weaning. Their anxiety levels were tested in the elevated plus maze. During pregnancy, sleep increased primarily due to increase in light non-REM sleep during dark period. There was an increase in non-REM sleep delta power after parturition, though the sleep was fragmented, especially during daytime. Simultaneous behavioural recording showed increased anxiety during third trimester of pregnancy and gradual reversal of it after parturition. This is the first report where diurnal and nocturnal variations in S-W and delta power, along with adaptive changes in anxiety, were studied before, during and after pregnancy. This study also provides an animal model for drug trials and studies on sleep disorders during peri-partum window. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of sleep disturbances during pregnancy with cesarean delivery and preterm birth.
   Methods: In this prospective study, 688 healthy women with singleton pregnancy were selected from three hospitals in Chengdu, China 2013-2014. Self-report questionnaires, including the sleep quantity and quality as well as exercise habits in a recent month were administered at 12-16, 24-28, and 32-36 weeks' gestation. Data on type of delivery, gestational age, and the neonates' weight were recorded after delivery. After controlling the potential confounders, a serial of multi-factor logistic regression models were performed to evaluate whether sleep quality and quantity were associated with cesarean delivery and preterm birth.
   Results: There were 382 (55.5%) women who had cesarean deliveries and 32 (4.7%) who delivered preterm. Women with poor sleep quality during the first (OR: 1.87, 95% CI [1.02-3.43]), second (5.19 [2.25-11.97]), and third trimester (1.82 [1.18-2.80]) were at high risk of cesarean delivery. Women with poor sleep quality during the second (5.35 [2.10-13.63]) and third trimester (3.01 [1.26-7.19]) as well as short sleep time (<7h) during the third trimester (4.67 [1.24-17.50]) were at high risk of preterm birth.
   Conclusions: Sleep disturbances are associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery and preterm birth throughout pregnancy. Obstetric care providers should advise women with childbearing age to practice healthy sleep hygiene measures.

LA English
DT Article
ID GASTRIC BYPASS; COMPLICATIONS; HYPOGLYCEMIA
AB Bariatric surgery is an effective therapy for obesity but is associated with long-term complications such as dumping syndromes and nutritional deficiencies. We report a case of a 26-year-old caucasian female, with history of morbid obesity and gestational diabetes (GDM), who became pregnant 4 months after Roux-en-Y bypass surgery. She developed GDM during subsequent pregnancy, which was initially managed with metformin and insulin. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia causing sleep disturbance and daytime somnolence occured at 19 weeks of pregnancy (19/40). Treatment with rapid-acting carbohydrates precipitated further hypoglycaemia. Laboratory investigations confirmed hypoglycaemia at 2.2 mmol/L with appropriately low insulin and C-peptide, intact HPA axis and negative IgG insulin antibodies. The patient was seen regularly by the bariatric dietetic team but concerns about compliance persisted. A FreeStyle Libre system was used from 21/40 enabling the patient a real-time feedback of changes in interstitial glucose following high or low GI index food intake. The patient declined a trial of acarbose but consented to an intraveneous dextrose infusion overnight resulting in improvement but not complete abolishment of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemias subsided at 34/40 and metformin and insulin had to be re-introduced due to high post-prandial blood glucose readings. An emergency C-section was indicated at 35 + 1/40 and a small-for-gestational-age female was delivered. There have been no further episodes of hypoglycaemia following delivery. This case illustrates challenges in the management of pregnancy following bariatric surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first use of FreeStyle Libre in dumping syndrome in pregnancy following bariatric surgery with troublesome nocturnal hypoglycaemia.

ID INFERTILITY
AB The article presents the results of a study of clinical and psychological factors of mental and emotional states among women (N=127) with the extracorporal fertilization (IVF) treatment. There are analyzed data from clinical interviews (type of infertility (female, male), cause of infertility, the planning time of pregnancy, number of attempts and the kind of IVF experiences of relationships in the parent family and with husband, self-relationship and health) and socio-demographic indicators (nature of work, type of marriage and number of marriages, the availability and scheduling of children). There are analyzed the relationship of these indicators with personal and situational anxiety. In the group among women with a female infertility a personal and situational anxiety were higher. Personal anxiety is higher among women with negative mental states (apathy, depression, emotional fatigue, high anxiety, and sleep disturbance, obsessive thoughts about pregnancy, fears, panic attacks), than among women with somatic problems (physical fatigue, lack of sexual desire, hormonal imbalance, endocrine disorders, vascular dystonia, cystitis, eye problems, problems with the musculoskeletal system). There is a need in further research to clarify causal relationships between personal characteristics and negative mental states, and other risk factors, such as problems in the relationship. Personal anxiety is higher among women who indicated relationship problems with their husbands. More severe anxiety among women with children (their own, husband's) can indicate the complexity of personal experiences and the system of motives of pregnancy that requires a differentiated approach in the psychological support to this category of women with the treatment on the IVF program.
   The obtained data testify that the characteristics and dynamics of the mental states among women in the program of IVF treatment can be associated with the causes of infertility; negative experience of relationships in the parent family, especially the authoritarian and emotionally cold relationship with the mother; the personal qualities among women, the nature of the dominant reproductive motives, which in turn are connected with the peculiarities of the social situation (marriage, children); the time of pregnancy planning, which may be due to the type (female, male) reproductive health problems and the number of IVF attempts. The identification of the relationships and interdependency of these factors, the nature of their impact on the treatment process, the course and outcome of pregnancy in cases of external reproductive technologies need further study in longitudinal and comparative studies on larger samples of respondents.
   The obtained data allow: to carry out early diagnostics of social and psychological factors that impede the process of infertility treatment methods of assisted reproduction; to carry out psychological prevention of the formation of negative mental states and targeted psychological assistance in medical treatment with the IVF program.

AB Study Objectives: To examine independent associations of sleep duration with total and abdominal adiposity, and the bidirectionality of these associations, in a young biethnic sample of children from a disadvantaged location.
   Methods: Child sleep duration (h/day) was parent-reported by questionnaire and indices of total (body weight, body mass index, percent body fat (%BF), sum of skinfolds) and abdominal adiposity (waist circumference) were measured using standard anthropometric procedures at approximately 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age in 1,338 children (58% South Asian; 42% White). Mixed effects models were used to quantify independent associations (expressed as standardised beta-coefficients (95% confidence interval (CI)) of sleep duration with adiposity indices using data from all four time-points. Factors considered for adjustment in models included basic demographics, pregnancy and birth characteristics, and lifestyle behaviours.
   Results: With the exception of the sum of skinfolds, sleep duration was inversely and independently associated with indices of total and abdominal adiposity in South Asian children. For example, one standard deviation (SD) higher sleep duration was associated with reduced % BF by -0.029 (95% CI: -0.053, -0.0043) SDs. Higher adiposity was also independently associated with shorter sleep duration in South Asian children (for example, % BF: beta = -0.10 (-0.16, -0.028) SDs). There were no significant associations in White children.
   Conclusions: Associations between sleep duration and adiposity are bidirectional and independent among South Asian children from a disadvantaged location. The results highlight the importance of considering adiposity as both a determinant of decreased sleep and a potential consequence.

AB Cocaine has strong reinforcing properties, which underlie its high addiction potential. Reinforcement of use of addictive drugs is associated with rises in dopamine (DA) in mesoaccumbal circuitry. Excitatory afferent input to mesoaccumbal circuitry sources from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT). Chronic, systemic cocaine exposure has been shown to have cellular effects on LDT cells, but acute actions of local application have never been demonstrated. Using calcium imaging, we show that acute application of cocaine to mouse brain slices induces calcium spiking in cells of the LDT. Spiking was attenuated by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and low calcium solutions, and abolished by prior exhaustion of intracellular calcium stores. Further, DA receptor antagonists reduced these transients, whereas DA induced rises with similar spiking kinetics. Amphetamine, which also results in elevated levels of synaptic DA, but via a different pharmacological action than cocaine, induced calcium spiking with similar profiles. Although large differences in spiking were not noted in an animal model associated with a heightened proclivity of acquiring addiction-related behavior, the prenatal nicotine exposed mouse (PNE), subtle differences in cocaine's effect on calcium spiking were noted, indicative of a reduction in action of cocaine in the LDT associated with exposure to nicotine during gestation. When taken together, our data indicate that acute actions of cocaine do include effects on LDT cells. Considering the role of intracellular calcium in cellular excitability, and of the LDT in addiction circuitry, our data suggest that cocaine effects in this nucleus may contribute to the high addiction potential of this drug.

AB Purpose: Childcare has been associated with obesity in children in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, although some observed no association. Few studies have focused on care during infancy, a period when children may be especially vulnerable.
   Participants: The Nurture Study is an observational birth cohort designed to assess longitudinal associations of childcare and the presence of multiple caregivers on infant adiposity and weight trajectories throughout the first year of life. We examine as potential mediators feeding, physical activity, sleep and stress. We completed recruitment in 2015. Of the 860 women who enrolled during pregnancy, 799 delivered a single live infant who met our inclusion criteria. Of those, 666 mothers (77.4%) agreed to participate in the study for themselves and their infants.
   Findings to date: Among the 666 women in the study, 472 (71%) identified as black, 127 (19%) as white, 7 (1%) as Asian or Asian American, 6 (1%) as Native American and 49 (7%) as other race or more than one race; 43 (7%) identified as Hispanic/Latina. Just under half (48%) had a high school diploma or less, 61% had household incomes <$20 000/year and 59% were married or living with a partner. The mean (SD) infant gestational age was 41.28 weeks (2.29) and birth weight for gestational age z-score was -0.31 (0.93). Just under half (49%) of infants were females, 69% received some human milk and 40% were exclusively breast fed at hospital discharge. Data collection began in 2013, is currently underway, and is scheduled to conclude in late 2016.
   Future plans: Results will help assess the magnitude of associations between childcare in infancy and subsequent obesity. Findings will also inform intervention and policy efforts to improve childcare environments and help prevent obesity in settings where many infants spend time.

ID FEASIBILITY
AB Diabetes is a lifelong condition with no cure. Diabetes has a serious effect on the patient, especially pregnant women that may cause problems, whether overdose or low of the insulin in the blood stream. The patient must use insulin whether by pumping as in the artificial pancreas (closed loop) or by injecting insulin manual (opened loop). However, every method has its own advantages and disadvantages, e. g. the opened loop system for artificial pancreas may have a risk during the night when the patient sleep. On the other hand, the closed loop can administer insulin and glucose at the right time with the right amount. However, the artificial pancreas is not available yet and it required more improvement to be reliable. The algorithm of artificial pancreas consists of measuring glucose in the blood of a patient by using glucose sensor and sends a signal to an insulin pump to adjust basal insulin rated according to the desired amount of insulin that the patient need. This procedure required devices with the patient; however, some patient may be advised to have a pancreas transplant.
   This paper reviews the current publication of an artificial pancreas and proposed a method to improve the control of an artificial pancreas. History of diabetes is described in this paper with a critical review of current studies. Also, it has tested pre-diabetes for pregnant women. The obtain results show that in breakfast the sugar level is increased high with random changing, hence based on the test, some foods should be ignored in breakfast, while other food recommended.

AB Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) which includes obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), has emerged as a risk factor for adverse maternal-foetal outcomes in pregnancy. Physiological changes of pregnancy predispose a woman at risk' towards developing SDB. The increasing incidence of OSA in pregnancy closely correlates with the population trends of obesity. Common screening tools validated in non-pregnant subjects including Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) are poor predictors of SDB in pregnancy. Preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are linked with SDB. Preeclampsia and OSA share common pathological associations. It is unclear if one predisposes the other. Foetal morbidity includes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm delivery, low birth weight, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and Apgar score of less than seven at one minute. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a well-documented treatment of SDB in pregnancy and has been shown to reverse some of the adverse events. It becomes imperative to diagnose and manage this condition as OSA causes substantial morbidity in the untreated pregnant patient and foetus. Three short clinical cases and a literature review on SDB on pregnancy are presented.

AB Fetal behavioural states (FBS) are measures of fetal wellbeing. In acute hypoxaemia, the human fetus adapts to a lower oxygen consuming state with changes in the cardiotocograph and reduced fetal activity. Recent studies of late gestation stillbirth described the importance of sleep position in the risk of intrauterine death. We designed this study to assess the effects of different maternal positions on FBS in healthy late gestation pregnancies under controlled conditions. Twenty-nine healthy women had continuous fetal ECG recordings under standardized conditions in four randomly allocated positions, left lateral, right lateral, supine and semi-recumbent. Two blinded observers, assigned fetal states in 5min blocks. Measures of fetal heart rate variability were calculated from ECG beat to beat data. Compared to state 2F, state 4F was less likely to occur when women were semi-recumbent [odds ratio (OR)=0.11, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.02, 0.55], and supine (OR=0.27, 95% CI 0.07, 1.10). State 1F was more likely on the right (OR=2.36, 95% CI 1.11, 5.04) or supine (OR=4.99, 95% CI 2.41, 10.43) compared to the left. State change was more likely when the mother was semi-recumbent (OR=2.17, 95% CI 1.19, 3.95) or supine (OR=2.67, 95% CI 1.46, 4.85). There was a significant association of maternal position to mean fetal heart rate. The measures of heart rate variability (SDNN and RMSSD) were reduced in both semi-recumbent and supine positions. In healthy late gestation pregnancy, maternal position affects FBS and heart rate variability. These effects are likely fetal adaptations to positions which may produce a mild hypoxic stress.

AB Study Objectives: To examine the influence of maternal sleep quality and nocturnal sleep duration on risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a multiethnic Asian population.
   Methods: A cohort of 686 women (376 Chinese, 186 Malay, and 124 Indian) with a singleton pregnancy attended a clinic visit at 26-28 weeks of gestation as part of the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes mother-offspring cohort study. Self-reported sleep quality and sleep duration were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). GDM was diagnosed based on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test administered after an overnight fast (1999 WHO criteria). Multiple logistic regression was used to model separately the associations of poor sleep quality (PSQI score > 5) and short nocturnal sleep duration (<6 h) with GDM, adjusting for age, ethnicity, maternal education, body mass index, previous history of GDM, and anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score).
   Results: In the cohort 296 women (43.1%) had poor sleep quality and 77 women (11.2%) were categorized as short sleepers; 131 women (19.1%) were diagnosed with GDM. Poor sleep quality and short nocturnal sleep duration were independently associated with increased risk of GDM (poor sleep, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to 2.76; short sleep, adjusted OR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.66).
   Conclusions: During pregnancy, Asian women with poor sleep quality or short nocturnal sleep duration exhibited abnormal glucose regulation. Treating sleep problems and improving sleep behavior in pregnancy could potentially reduce the risk and burden of GDM.

AB Objectives Whether racial/ethnic differences in prevalence/reporting of sleep disorders exist in pregnant women/women of child-bearing age is unknown. Study objectives were to estimate prevalence of sleep disorders and to examine racial/ethnic differences in sleep disorders, reporting of sleep issues, and amount of sleep among women of child-bearing age (15-44 years) in the US. Methods Through a secondary analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2010 (3175 non-pregnant, 432 pregnant women in main analysis), prevalence of sleep disorders, reporting of sleep disorders to a physician/health professional, and amount of sleep were estimated overall, by pregnancy status, and by race/ethnicity stratified by pregnancy status. Racial/ethnic differences in reporting of trouble sleeping by pregnancy status were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results Prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders among women of childbearing age was 4.9 % [3.9 % pregnant; 5.1 % non-pregnant (p < 0.01)]. Significantly fewer pregnant and non-pregnant minority women reported adequate sleep (7-8 h) than non-Hispanic white (white) women (p < 0.05). Among non-pregnant women, odds of report of trouble sleeping were significantly higher for white compared to black (aOR 0.47 [95 % CI 0.36, 0.61]) or Mexican-American women (aOR 0.29 [95 % CI 0.21, 0.41]); non-pregnant minority women were also significantly less likely to report trouble sleeping than white women when controlling for amount of sleep. Among pregnant women, these same trends were found. Discussion Compared to white women, minority women, despite reporting less adequate sleep, are less likely to report trouble sleeping, providing evidence of an important health disparity.

AB IntroductionSleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, yet underdiagnosed and under-investigated. We evaluated sleep quality during pregnancy and assessed associated factors, especially depressive and anxiety symptoms.
   Material and methodsA total of 78 healthy pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study were studied twice prospectively during pregnancy (in mid-pregnancy and late pregnancy). Sleep quality was evaluated by the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, depressive symptoms by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and anxiety symptoms by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.
   ResultsPoor general sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep, the number of nocturnal awakenings per night, and too-early morning awakenings increased in late pregnancy compared with mid-pregnancy (all p-values < 0.020). The total insomnia score (p < 0.001) and sleep latency increased (p = 0.005), but sleep duration and preferred sleep duration did not change. Women tended to snore more often in late pregnancy, but apneas remained rare. Almost one-fourth of the women reported both morning and daytime sleepiness, but the frequencies did not increase during the follow up. In late pregnancy, depressive and anxiety symptoms were cross-sectionally related to sleep disturbances, but depressive or anxiety symptoms in mid-pregnancy were not associated with sleep disturbances in late pregnancy.
   ConclusionsWe found deterioration in sleep quality across pregnancy. However, no increase in negative daytime consequences was found, presumably indicating a compensatory capacity against sleep impairment. Additionally, depressive and anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances were only cross-sectionally associated. Our study calls for further research on the factors that influence sleep disturbances during pregnancy.

AB Objective: To evaluate the independent and combined associations of maternal self-reported poor sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation during the third trimester
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1298 pregnant women (between 24 and 28 gestational weeks) attending prenatal clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality. Multivariate logistical regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) after adjusting for putative confounders.
   Results: Approximately, 17% of women were classified as having poor sleep quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of > 5 vs <= 5). Further, the prevalence of antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were 10.3% and 8.5%, respectively in this cohort. After adjusting for confounders including depression, poor sleep quality was associated with a 2.81-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (OR=2.81; 95% CI 1.78-4.45). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in a 28% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (OR=1.28; 95% CI 1.15-1.41). The odds of suicidal ideation was particularly high among depressed women with poor sleep quality (OR=13.56 95% CI 7.53-24.41) as compared with women without either risk factor.
   Limitations: This cross-sectional study utilized self-reported data. Causality cannot be inferred, and results may not be fully generalizable.
   Conclusion: Poor sleep quality, even after adjusting for depression, is associated with antepartum suicidal ideation. Our findings support the need to explore sleep-focused interventions for pregnant women.

TI Wahakura Versus Bassinet for Safe Infant Sleep: A Randomized Trial
SO PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
ID DEATH-SYNDROME; CARE PRACTICES; RISK-FACTORS; NEW-ZEALAND
AB OBJECTIVES: To compare an indigenous sleep device (wahakura) for infants at high risk for sudden unexpected death with a bassinet, for measures of infant sleep position, head covering, breastfeeding, bed-sharing, and maternal sleep and fatigue.
   METHODS: A total of 200 mainly Maori pregnant women were recruited from deprived areas of New Zealand. They were randomized to receive a bassinet or wahakura and asked to sleep the infant in this device from birth. Questionnaires at 1, 3, and 6 months and an overnight infrared video in the home at 1 month were completed.
   RESULTS: An intention-to-treat and an "as-used" analysis of questionnaires showed no group differences at 1, 3, and 6 months in infant-adult direct bed-sharing (7% vs 12%, P = .24 at 1 month), and at the 6-month interview, the wahakura group reported twice the level of full breastfeeding (22.5% vs 10.7%, P = .04). Maternal sleep and fatigue were not significantly different between groups. Video identified no increase in head covering, prone/side sleep position, or bed-sharing in the wahakura group, either from intention-to-treat analysis, or when analyzed for actual sleep location.
   CONCLUSION There were no significant differences in infant risk behaviors in wahakura compared with bassinets and there were other advantages, including an increase in sustained breastfeeding. This suggests wahakura are relatively safe and can be promoted as an alternative to infant-adult bed-sharing. Policies that encourage utilization are likely to be helpful in high-risk populations.

AB Background: Despite progress made in the last decades, malaria persists as a pressing health issue in sub-Saharan Africa. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to infection and serious health outcomes for themselves and their unborn child. Risk can be mitigated through appropriate use of control measures such as insecticide-treated bed nets. Although social networks can influence uptake of preventive strategies, the role of social influence on bed net ownership has not been explored. During an evaluation of a bed net distribution programme, the influence of non-health care advisors on ownership and use of bed nets by pregnant women in Kumasi, Ghana was examined.
   Methods: Data were collected through in-person interviews with 300 pregnant women seeking antenatal care in an urban hospital in Kumasi, Ghana. Participants were asked about their bed net ownership, bed net use, and information about three personal contacts that they go to for pregnancy advice. Information about these advisors was combined into an influence score. Logistic regression models were used to determine the association between the score and bed net ownership. Those who owned a bed net were further assessed to determine if interpersonal influence was associated with self-reported sleeping under the bed net the previous night.
   Results: Of the 294 women in the analysis, 229 (78%) reported owning bed nets. Of these bed net owners, 139 (61%) reported using a bed net the previous night. A dose response relationship was observed between the interpersonal influence score and bed net ownership and use. Compared to the lowest influence score, those with the highest influence score (> 1 SD above the mean) were marginally more likely to own a bed net [OR = 2.37, 95% CI (0.87, 6.39)] and much more likely to use their bed net [5.38, 95% CI (1.89, 15.25)] after adjusting for other factors.
   Conclusions: Interpersonal influence appears to have modest impact on ownership and use of bed nets by pregnant women in an urban area of Ghana. Further investigations would need to be conducted to determine if the relationship is causal or if individuals who associate are simply more likely to have similar practices.

AB The design of an early mobile health application (app) prototype to manage interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, a chronic condition characterized by recurrent pain/discomfort in the bladder and pelvic floor, is described. The purpose of this app prototype is to help people who have IC/PBS manage and learn what triggers their symptoms. Another aim of this research was to provide an example of how sex and gender could be included into the design of a health information system. Based on a literature search of common symptoms and challenges faced by people living with IC/PBS, the researcher created an app prototype design including many features: resources for relaxation, mental health, intimacy, pregnancy, and daily life; reminders for appointments, and medication; logs for diet, activity, sleep, pain, menstruation; and a link to a public washroom locator. This prototype will later undergo usability and content evaluation.

AB Objectives: To observe and compare the treatment effect of multiple insulin injections and insulin pump therapy on pregnant women with gestational diabetes.
   Methods: From January, 2015 to May, 2017, 90 pregnant women with gestational diabetes enrolled in Linyi Chinese Medicine Hospital were collected and randomly divided into research group and reference group. In the research group, 45 patients were treated with insulin pump therapy. All 45 patients in the reference group were treated with multiple insulin injections therapy. General treatment effect of these two groups was then observed and compared.
   Results: After treatment, in research group, patients' fasting blood-glucose level was 5.2 +/- 0.6 mmol/L, 2 h post-meal blood sugar level was 7.3 +/- 1.2 mmol/L and the blood-glucose standard time was 2.5 +/- 0.8 d; However, in the reference group, the fasting blood-glucose level was 6.8 +/- 0.6 mmol/L, 2 h post-meal blood sugar level was 8.8 +/- 1.2 mmol/L and the blood-glucose standard time was 6.9 +/- 1.4 d, P< 0.05. When comparing the changes of peripheral blood sugar between the 2 groups after treatment, in research group, the peripheral blood sugar level was 4.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/L before breakfast, 5.3 +/- 1.2 mmol/L after breakfast, 5.8 +/- 1.2 mmol/L before lunch, 5.4 +/- 1.2 mmol/L after lunch, 5.2 +/- 1.0 mmol/L before dinner, 6.3 +/- 1.1 mmol/L after dinner, 6.7 +/- 1.4 mmol/L before sleep, while in reference group, the peripheral blood sugar level was 3.6 +/- 0.8 mmol/L before breakfast, 6.5 +/- 2.3 mmol/L after breakfast, 6.6 +/- 1.5 mmol/L before lunch, 7.3 +/- 1.5 mmol/L after lunch, 5.8 +/- 1.2 mmol/L before dinner, 8.6 +/- 1.7 mmol/L after dinner, 7.3 +/- 1.3 mmol/L before sleep, P<0.05. Hypoglycemia occurred more frequently in reference group than in the research group after calculation and observation.
   Conclusion: Compared with multiple insulin injections therapy, the project of treating gestational diabetes patients with insulin pump therapy has more precise effect. Additionally, it has great safety and reliability, along with huge application value.

AB Depression affects up to 23% of pregnant women and is associated with adverse physical/mental health outcomes for both the mother and baby. Depressed pregnant women may be more likely to engage in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors that contribute to an increased risk for chronic disease. Little is known regarding depressed pregnant women's perceptions, uses of, and interests in complementary health approaches. Study participants (mean age 28.7 +/- 6.8; n = 1032) included pregnant women >= 8 weeks gestation who responded to a survey assessing physical and mental health and wellness practices. Of those completing the survey, depressed pregnant women (n = 272) had significantly higher levels of anxiety (P < .001) and stress (P < .001) and had poorer sleep quality (P < .001), mindfulness (P < .001), and social support (P < .001) compared to nondepressed pregnant women (n = 760). A majority (84%) of depressed pregnant women would consider using a complementary health approach for weight and/or stress management during pregnancy, and more than 50% were interested in yoga.

DE Attitude8; Ethical; Morality; Traditional; Values
AB A new form of colonialization emerged in which African youths in a bid to be 'civilized' copied the lifestyle exhibited by the foreigners. They then abandoned those aspects of our cultural values that held true to the tenets of human morality and dignity. Consequently, the rising wave of sexual promiscuity, teenage pregnancy, cultism and various violent acts have assumed alarming proportions in our society. In African Traditional Society, indigenous moral values play significant role in the development of human beings and the society. These values are universally accepted as the standard norms of the society. Strict adherence and observance of these ethical will ensure a peaceful, settled and united society. Violation of values is directly aimed at doom as these values are gifts from God to ensure a safe and peaceful society for man. For instance there is an Esan axiom which say "adatota non didhilin aki jie enibhokhan we" meaning couples discuss deep matters when children are sleeping. This deep matter refers to conjugal issue. It is discovered that sexual matters are displayed, discussed on radio, television etc which is exposing our young ones to immorality. Hence, this paper examines the Negative Attitude of modern youth on African Traditional Ethical values and its Detrimental Blow on morality on the Esan Nation of Nigeria. The paper discusses the advent of Modernity on traditional ethnical values. Modernity is not evil on itself, but it has been used in propagating disobedience to African Tradition rules and regulation. Modernity has swept us away from almost all traditional types of social order and ethical values, in quite unprecedented fashion. It further exposes the various ethnical values held in high esteem by the people Esan. The work employs the historical, descriptive and evaluative research methodologies. The work concludes that our values should be rejuvenated and taught to the younger generation who are the adults and parents of tomorrow.

DE psychological counseling; stress; adolescent
AB Adolescent is transition phase from childhood to adulthood. Recently, teenagers undergo significant change and development in all aspects, either physical, social, or psychological. One of the developments is on their sexual and hormonal organs, where they would be interested with their sexual counterparts, have desire to date, and yearn for sexual experience. Unlimited sexual activity result in unwanted pregnancy, early marriage, and abortion. If sexual intercourse or teenage pregnancy occurs and the girl's side did not willing to accept this occurrence, they could press charges and convict the boy's side through legal processes. The convicted teenagers will be rehabilitated and placed in Child Development Agency (CDA). In Child Development Agency, they suffer from psychological issues such as stress indicated by difficulty to sleep, anxiety, loneliness, short-tempered and easily offended, daydreaming, blaming others, inability to concentrate and so on. These conditions should be intervened by giving psychological counseling-as one of the interventions. The study aims to examine the effects of psychological counseling to reduce stress among teenagers in CDA.The subjects are 10 male and female teenagers who undergo rehabilitation in CDA. The counseling is conducted four times to each subject individually. The analysis is conducted quantitatively by Wilcoxon Ranks Test and qualitatively. The results show significant decrease of stress after counseling. Subjects feel happy because they are understood, given attention, and being listened to thus reducing their loneliness, and it also decrease their duration of daydreaming by doing many activities given by the counselor. Relaxation given in counseling process also help them to sleep, reduce anxiety and increase their concentration. 60% subjects could understand the meaning behind the occurrence they suffer from and are willing to try to be someone better and would not repeat the same mistake.

   IMPACT
AB Obesity is one of the major health problems and a determining factor in the prevalence of diseases such as metabolic syndrome, asthma, sleep apnea, infertility and various types of cancer. Its origin is multifactorial, involving genetic, socioeconomic and environmental factors. These last ones contribute mostly to explain the current epidemic growth of this disease. The sedentary lifestyle, inadequate diet, lack of sleep, alterations in intestinal microbiota and stress are factors related to its development.
   Since Barker presented his hypothesis about the "fetal origin of adult diseases", there are increasing number of studies that show the influence of an inadequate nutritional status and maternal weight in the development of chronic diseases, as obesity in offspring.
   The nutritional deficiencies of the pregnant mother cause epigenetic modifications and abnormal programming of the development of organs and devices, adapting the fetus to this situation of deficiency and being able to adapt to an obesogenic environment after birth, increasing its propensity to obesity. Also, poor maternal nutritional status is related to intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight infants, with a higher risk of childhood and adult central obesity.
   Currently, deficient intake of micronutrients and overweight or maternal obesity tend to overlap, and this combination may exacerbate the increase in obesity in the offspring. It is important to identify pregnant mothers at risk of suffering nutritional alterations and establish their improvement as a primary prevention strategy for overweight and obesity.

AB In this paper, we discuss how the implementation of design-inclusive User Experience Research (UXR) has influenced the composition of UXR and design activities in the industrial setting of Philips Design. We present three design case studies that were executed in a time span of three years: a baby sleep project; a pregnancy project; and a baby bottle-feeding project. Through a retrospective analysis we conclude that the approach adopted in these cases progressed from complete separation of UXR and design activities to design-inclusive UXR in which design forms an integral part of research. This is reflected by a rearrangement of project activities to identify, envision, enable and evaluate user experiences. Previously the UXR (identify and evaluate) and design (envision and enable) activities were executed sequentially. Now, these four project activities merge in studying design interventions in context over a prolonged time, to iteratively explore and advance UX design qualities.

AB Bariatric surgery is today the most effective long-term therapy for the management of patients with severe obesity, and its use is recommended by the relevant guidelines of the management of obesity in adults. Bariatric surgery is in general safe and effective, but it can cause new clinical problems and is associated with specific diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic needs. For clinicians, the acquisition of special knowledge and skills is required in order to deliver appropriate and effective care to the post-bariatric patient. In the present recommendations, the basic notions needed to provide first-level adequate medical care to post-bariatric patients are summarised. Basic information about nutrition, management of co-morbidities, pregnancy, psychological issues as well as weight regain prevention and management is derived from current evidences and existing guidelines. A short list of clinical practical recommendations is included for each item. It remains clear that referral to a bariatric multidisciplinary centre, preferably the one performing the original procedure, should be considered in case of more complex clinical situations.

   PATHOGENESIS
AB Significant progress in the field of free radical biology and medicine since the middle of the century has been made. Subsequently, the spectrum of diseases and pathological states believed to be associated with free radicals significantly has been expanded. At present, the development of oxidative stress molecularcellular mechanisms investigations is extremely topical for medical science because it involves in a number of pathologies, including social-significance disorders.
   The important role of the lipid peroxidation (LPO) system and deficiency of antioxidant defense (AOD) factors in general pathological processes has been proved by authors and their assistants in the laboratories of the Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine of Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (Novosibirsk), since 1972. A list of these processes: cold and toxic stress, tumor growth, inflammation, physiologic and pathologic pregnancies (including experimental models). In fact the first clinical investigations were not only in the USSR, but also in the whole world. Several patents proved this.
   In the experiments on rodents, the phenomenon of imprinting on the offspring's LPO and drug metabolism after LPO inducing toxicants action during pregnancy was discovered.
   The research series continued at the Scientific Centre for Family Health and Human Reproduction Problems (Irkutsk). Technology for oxidative stress evaluation and the use of antioxidants in the complex therapy of complicated and uncomplicated pregnancy, reproductive disorders in men and women, sleep disorders, sociallysignificant diseases, pediatric practice were created here. The analysis of lipid peroxidation changes during the physiological development of the reproductive function performed. The gender and ethnic dependence of lipid peroxidation was noted. Ethno-specific changes in the LPO-AOD system among the representatives of the Buryat ethnic group at different pathologic conditions (diabetes mellitus type 1, essential arterial hypertension, complicated pregnancy, endocrine infertility, endometriosis, male infertility), were revealed. The LPO- AOD was used to define "relative ethnic norm" for Buryat ethnic group. The "specificity" of features of nonspecific process of free radical oxidation in different pathologic situations was postulated. It is very important for personalized diagnosis, prevention and treatment.

AB Olfactory bulbectomy in rodents is considered a putative model of depression. Depression is often associated with drug addiction. Our previous studies demonstrated that methamphetamine (MA) administration to rat mothers affects both, mothers and their pups. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of bulbectomy, as a model of depression, and MA administration on behavior of rat mothers and postnatal development of their pups. Adult female Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: bulbectomized (OBX) and sham-operated (SH). A period of 20 days was allowed for the development of the depressive-like phenotype. Animals were tested in the motor activity test and 2 % sucrose preference for anhedonia and hyperactive locomotor response to a novel environment, respectively. After then females were impregnated. Pregnant females were exposed to daily subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of MA (5 mg/kg) or saline (SA) during the entire gestation period. Postnatally, maternal behavior and pup development was examined. The effect of a challenge dose of MA (1 mg/kg, s.c.) on behavior was further examined in adult male offspring. Our results showed no differences in the maternal behavior as a matter of bulbectomy, only OBX rats slept more than all the SH controls. Pups from OBX mothers were born with lower birthweight and gained less weight during the postnatal development than pups from SH controls. Both, bulbectomy and MA administration, delayed the eyes opening. As a matter of functional development of the pups, maternal OBX procedure impaired the performance in the Bar-holding test, but only in saline group. OBX/SA group was the worst in the Bar-holding test relative to all the other groups. In addition, pups from OBX mothers dropped more boluses during the Bar-holding test, suggesting that they were more stressed. In adult male offspring, bulbectomy increased immobility only in the SA/SA group. Prenatal MA exposure increased locomotion, while decreasing immobility. In addition, challenge dose of MA in adulthood increased distance traveled, locomotion, rearing, and average and maximal velocity, while decreasing immobility and grooming. In conclusion, our results suggest that depressive-like phenotype of rat mothers induces impairment in somatic and functional development of their male offspring.

AB One of the customers' considerations for purchasing a product is it can satisfy their feeling and emotion. It because of such product can enhance sleep quality of pregnant women. However, most of the existing product such as maternity pillows are still designed based on companies' perspective. This study aims to capture the desire of pregnant women toward maternity pillow desired product by using kansei words and analyze the optimal design with Taguchi method. Eight collected kansei words were durable, aesthetic, comfort, portable, simple, multifunction, attractive motive, and easy to maintain. While L16 orthogonal array is used because there are three variables with two levels and four variables with four levels. It can be concluded that the best maternity pillow that can satisfy the customers can be designed by combining D1-E2-F2-G2-C1-B2-A2 means the model is U shape, flowery motive, medium color, Bag model B, cotton pillow cover, filled with silicon, and use double zipper. However, it is also possible to create combination of D1-E2-F2-G2-C1-B1-A1 by using consideration of cost which means that the zipper is switched to single as well as filled with dacron. In addition, the total percentage of contribution by using ANOVA reaches 95%.

AB Introduction. The sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), accidental asphyxia and suffocation in bed are the most significant part of the conditions united by the term "sudden unexpected death in infants" (SUDI). A high level of SUDI and a significant proportion in infant mortality are typical for countries with low rates of infant and babies mortality. The aim of the research is to study the epidemiological characteristics and risk factors of the sudden infant death syndrome in the Komi Republic from 1997 to 2015, to assess the contribution of SIDS, occasional asphyxia and suffocation in bed to the mortality of infants to determine the optimization of approaches to the prevention of these conditions.
   Materials and Methods. The retrospective data analysis of the death of infants has been performed according to medical records, protocols of pathoanatomical studies, and the conclusions of the infant mortality commission of the Ministry of Health of the Komi Republic from 1997 to 2015. Risk factors were assessed retrospectively on the scale of life-threatening conditions (Tsinserling A. V. and co-authors, 1987).
   Results. The cumulative infant mortality rate from SIDS was 0.63 +/- 0.33 % (median -0.55 %). Within the past 5 years, when the infant mortality rate in the region has not changed significantly, averaging 5.22 +/- 0.73 %, the infant mortality rate from SIDS was 0.40 +/- 0.25 % (median 0.43). This compares with the level registered in the USA (0,4% in 2013) and in Western Europe with a similar level of infant mortality. In infant mortality of in the post-neonatal period, SIDS occurred in 13.8 +/- 6.3 % (median-12.2 %). Generally recognized data on the significant contribution of social and biological factors to decreasing the risk of sudden death syndrome were confirmed. The scale of life-threatening conditions showed the high sensitivity to death from SIDS. An examination of the place accident and assess of death circumstances is established to be absent in 61.3 % of cases of SIDS. Accidental asphyxia and suffocation in bed have accounted for 40 % in the structure of infant mortality from external causes. 70 % of cases are caused by the violation of infant safe sleeping space standarts.
   Discussion and Conclusions. It is necessary to intensify measures to prevent infant deaths associated with sleep. First, this is an explanatory work being performed already at the stage of pregnancy planning, aimed at women's and their environment's denying from bad habits. It seems reasonable to implant the national program to optimize conditions of safe infant sleeping environment, to support and preserve breastfeeding. The development and implementation of a single algorithm for assessing the circumstances of infant death at the prehospital stage will allow unifying approaches to diagnosis and optimizing the preventive measures to reduce infant deaths associated with sleep.

AB Study Objectives: To evaluate feasibility and efficacy of a hospital-based protocol for improving sleep in high-risk antepartum patients.
   Methods: Sleep measures were compared during 1 week of hospitalization before and after implementing a Sleep Improvement Protocol for Antepartum Patients (SIP-AP). A non-randomized convenience sample of usual care controls was compared to a subsequent intervention sample after the protocol was implemented. Women were eligible if they spoke English, were medically stable, pregnant for at least 20 weeks, and hospitalized at least 24 hours; 25 pregnant women had sufficient data for analyses (11 controls, 14 intervention). Sleep was assessed in 3 ways: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was completed after obtaining consent to estimate sleep quality prior to hospital admission; sleep diary completed each hospital day; and General Sleep Disturbance Scale completed at 7 days or prior to hospital discharge. Symptoms that could affect sleep were assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale.
   Results: Both groups recorded similar sleep duration (7 hours) but the intervention group had fewer symptoms and significantly (P = .015) lower sleep disturbance scores (53.1 +/- 14.5) than controls (71.9 +/- 18.8). Participant feedback about the intervention was positive, although adherence to components of the intervention protocol was variable.
   Conclusions: This pilot study provides evidence of the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the SIP-AP intervention for reducing symptoms and improving sleep of antepartum patients during hospitalization. Further detailed evaluation of specific components of this protocol is warranted, and other types of hospitalized patients may benefit from unit-based modifications to this SIP-AP protocol.

AB Objective: This research aimed to explore the curative effect of noninvasive ventilation in the treatment of children Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS).
   Methods: From Nov 2015-2016, 70 children OSAS patients in Binzhou People's Hospital were selected as the study subjects and were randomly divided into surgery group (n=35) and ventilation group (n=35). Patients in the surgery group were treated with routine operation while ventilation group were received non-invasive ventilation followed by the routine operation. The curative effects in the two groups were analyzed with statistical comparison method.
   Results: Total effective rate of the ventilation group was significantly higher than that of the surgery group, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of the ventilation group was lower than that of the surgery group and the longest time of apnea, apnea hypopnea index as well as Epworth Sleepiness Score(ESS) of the ventilation group was obviously lower than that of the surgery group (P< 0.05), while abortion and ectopic pregnancy rate of the intervention group was strikingly lower than that of the control group significantly.
   Conclusion: Non-invasive ventilation has good effects in the treatment of children Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSHS).

AB The placenta is important in providing a healthy environment for the fetus and plays a central role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE). Fetal and placental developments are influenced by epigenetic programming. There is some evidence that PE is controlled to an altered circadian homeostasis. In a nested case-control study embedded in the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort, we obtained placental tissue, umbilical cord leukocytes (UCL), and human umbilical venous endothelial cells of 13 early-onset PE, 16 late-onset PE and 83 controls comprising 36 uncomplicated and 47 complicated pregnancies, i.e. 27 fetal growth restricted and 20 spontaneous preterm birth. To investigate the associations between PE and the epigenetics of circadian clock and clock-controlled genes in placental and newborn tissues, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip and a candidate-gene approach using ANCOVA was applied on 939 CpGs of 39 circadian clock and clock-controlled genes. DNA methylation significantly differed in early-onset PE compared with spontaneous preterm birth at 6 CpGs in placental tissue (3.73(E-5) <= p <= 0.016) and at 21 CpGs in UCL (1.09(E-5) <= p <= 0.024). In early-onset PE compared with fetal growth restriction 2 CpGs in placental tissue (p < 0.05) and 8 CpGs in uncomplicated controls (4.78(E-5) <= p <= 0.049) were significantly different. Moreover, significantly different DNA methylation in early-onset PE compared with uncomplicated controls was shown at 6 CpGs in placental tissue (1.36(E-4) <= p <= 0.045) and 11 CpGs in uncomplicated controls (2.52(E-6) <= p <= 0.009). No significant associations were shown with late-onset PE between study groups or tissues. The most differentially methylated CpGs showed hypomethylation in placental tissue and hyper-methylation in uncomplicated controls. In conclusion, DNA methylation of circadian clock and clock-controlled genes demonstrated most differences in UCL of early-onset PE compared with spontaneous preterm birth. Implications of the tissue-specific variations in epigenetic programming for circadian performance and long-term health need further investigation.

AB Study Objectives: Deterioration in sleep quality seems to be a natural consequence of physical changes during pregnancy. It is still unclear if insomnia in pregnancy is associated with the same factors as chronic insomnia in the general population. The aim of this study was to explore the determinants of insomnia during pregnancy.
   Methods: The study included 266 women (mean age: 30.6 +/- 5 years, weeks of pregnancy: 36 [interquartile range 32-38]) recruited at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Medical University of Warsaw. The assessment of variables was performed using the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Regestein Hyperarousal Scale (HS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire, and a semi-structured interview about different sleep disorders.
   Results: Almost 40% of the women in our study received a diagnosis of insomnia based on AIS cutoff scores. The between-group analyses indicated that HS score, BDI score, eating at night, legs tingling, nightmares, snoring, and myoclonus differentiated the groups of individuals with insomnia from those without insomnia. Other variables were not significantly different between the groups. We divided individuals with insomnia in terms of insomnia duration: 49% developed insomnia at least 1 year before the study onset and 39.6% during pregnancy. For further analyses we used only the women in whom insomnia developed during pregnancy. Logistic regression confirmed that depressive symptoms (BDI) and eating at night were significant predictors of insomnia in pregnancy.
   Conclusions: Depressive symptoms and night eating are key factors related to insomnia developed during pregnancy.

AB Objective: The aim of the study was to present the biopsychosocial effects of foetal alcohol syndrome among the children from the Interventional Care Facility in Otwock in the years 2012-2015. Material and methods: We analysed medical records from the years 2012 to 2015. Medical documentation consisted of the child's stay record, psychological diagnosis, maternal interview, social interview, a round check report, medical assessment and consultation records, neurological examination reports and physiotherapist reports. The study included medical documentation of 18 girls (29%) and 44 boys (71%). In total, 62 children aged between 3 days and 1 year were included in the study group. Results: Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy is still declared by many women (69%), including 44% of mothers consuming alcohol throughout the duration of pregnancy. All children in the Interventional Care Facility had at least 2 dysmorphic facial features. Sucking dysfunction, which caused difficulty when feeding, was observed in 59 children, and dysaesthesia - in 56 children. Children with foetal alcohol syndrome were very tearful, experienced tensions (58 children), hyperactivity (59 children) as well as sleep disorders (60 children). They frequently experienced emotional disorders (60 children) and problems with establishing contact with other people (44 children). Conclusions: It was found that alcohol has teratogenic effects on the developing foetus. Any amount of alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman can cause damage to the foetus. Foetal exposure to alcohol leads to multiple disorders that occur not only in the biological, but also in the psychological sphere. The study confirmed that children with foetal alcohol syndrome suffer from multiple health problems and have difficulty functioning in society due to their "otherness".

AB The global prevalence of obesity continues to rise at an alarming rate and 37.7% of US adults are obese. Understanding the causes of excessive weight gain is extremely important, as it paves the way for the development of new therapies to control this epidemic. Obesity is a heterogeneous chronic disease where multiple factors interact to produce a state of positive energy balance leading to an increase in body weight. This review focuses on the major biological, environmental, and behavioral determinants of obesity. The key biological factors include genetics, brain-gut axis, prenatal determinants, pregnancy, menopause, neuroendocrine conditions, medications, physical disability, gut microbiome, and viruses. Propensity to develop obesity owing to one or more of these elements is exacerbated by environmental and behavioral influences. Environmental factors include food abundance, built environments, socioeconomic status, culture, social bias, and environmental chemicals. Behavioral factors comprise excessive calorie intake, eating patterns, sedentary lifestyles, insufficient sleep, and smoking cessation. It is essential to identify the determinants of adiposity in individuals with obesity to tailor prevention and treatment techniques effectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Worldwide, the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased, amounting to 42 million overweight or obese children, and there is increasing evidence that the origins are within the first 1,000 days: the period of conception through 2 years. Antecedents of early childhood obesity are multifactorial, and associations of varying strength have been documented for genetic/epigenetic, biologic, dietary, environmental, social, and behavioral influences. Modifiable factors in pregnancy and early infancy associated with childhood obesity include maternal overweight/obesity, maternal smoking, gestational weight gain, infant and young child feeding, caregiver responsive feeding practices, as well as sleep duration, and physical activity. Promising obesity prevention interventions include those beginning during the first 1,000 days, using a multicomponent approach, with roots in nutrition education theories or behavior change communication that can continue over time. However, the limited number of completed interventions to date (within pediatric clinics or in home-based or community settings) may not be scalable to the magnitude needed for sustainable obesity prevention. Scale-up interventions that can be maintained for the durations needed, addressing infant and young child feeding and other modifiable risk factors associated with childhood obesity are needed.

AB Objective: It has been shown in animal models that circadian clock exists in corpora luteum which is essential for maintaining pregnancy. However, it is unknown whether circadian clock exists in corpora luteum and its relation with steroidogenesis in human ovary.Study design: Human luteinized granulosa cells from patients who underwent in vitro fertilization treatment were purified and cultured in vitro. Accumulation patterns of circadian gene and steroidogenesis-related gene mRNAs in human luteinized granulosa cells were observed during the 48hours after treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) by quantitative PCR.Results: We found that the circadian genes CLOCK, PER2, and BMAL1 were expressed in cultured human luteinized granulosa cells. Among these genes, only expression of PER2 displayed oscillating patterns with a 16-h period in these cells after stimulation by hCG. Expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 did not show significant oscillating patterns. Expression of the steroidal acute regulatory protein (STAR) gene showed an oscillating pattern that was similar to that of PER2. Expression of CYP11A1, HSD3B2, and CYP19A1 increased significantly after hCG stimulation; however, none of these genes displayed significant oscillating patterns.Conclusions: Molecular circadian clock exists in human luteinized granulosa cells and may be related with steroidogenesis in human ovary.

AB The potent and now longstanding evidence of the association between placentation-related disorders and cardiovascular disease should be translated into clinical practice in order to introduce a preventive approach to future obstetric and cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this review is to integrate cardiovascular risk/disease and obstetric complications, which are linked by endothelial dysfunction, as windows of opportunity for improving women's health. Questionnaires adaptable to local practices are proposed to incorporate cardiovascular and obstetrical indexes into two stages of a woman's lifetime.

AB Objective: To analyse factors associated with the susceptibility of early childhood caries (ECC), populations with a high risk of ECC were screened and guidance for ECC prevention was proposed.
   Methods: A total of 392 children aged 24 to 71 months were selected for oral examination in Qingdao. Parents or guardians of the participants completed the questionnaires and decayed missing filled surface (dmfs) were recorded. Differences in caries condition and oral health behaviour in different families were compared. Risk factors related to ECC were screened. The subjects were finally grouped based on the obtained dmfs into three groups: caries-free, ECC and S-ECC (severe ECC). Association of risk factors with the caries status was analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis.
   Results: There were significant differences among the caries-free, ECC and S-ECC groups in three parameters: eating too many sweets each day, brushing before and after sleeping, and whether parents helped to brush (P < 0.01). Combined factors such as the parents' level of education, oral health knowledge, attitudes, the family's annual income, the age of children when they start to brush and not brushing regularly were also significantly related to ECC (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed among the three groups for these factors, including birth condition and nursing state, physical condition of the mother during pregnancy, feeding situation, if a pacifier was used during sleep, duration of brushing, frequency of mouth rinsing after meals each day and brushing with fluoride toothpaste (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Eating a lot of sweets, an incorrect brushing method, starting brushing at a later stage and not brushing regularly are susceptible factors for ECC. Emphasising oral health knowledge to parents and guardians, conducting proper brushing methods, limiting the frequency of sweets being eaten and avoiding an inappropriate habit of eating sweets are very important factors in the prevention of ECC.

AB Objective: Public Health initiatives, such as the Safe to Sleep campaign, have traditionally targeted infants' risk factors for the prevention of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, controversy remains regarding maternal and obstetrical risk factors for SIDS. In our study, we sought out to determine both modifiable and non-modifiable obstetrical and maternal risk factors associated with SIDS.Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study using the CDC's Linked Birth-Infant Death data from the United States for the year 2010. The impact of several obstetrical and maternal risk factors on the risk of overall infant mortality and SIDS was estimated using unconditional regression analysis, adjusting for relevant confounders.Results: Our cohort consisted of 4,007,105 deliveries and 24,174 infant deaths during the first year of life, of which 1991 (8.2%) were due to SIDS. Prominent risk factors for SIDS included (OR [95% CI]): black race, 1.89 [1.68-2.13]; maternal smoking, 3.56 [3.18-3.99]; maternal chronic hypertension, 1.73 [1.21-2.48]; gestational hypertension, 1.51 [1.23-1.87]; premature birth<37 weeks, 2.16 [1.82-2.55]; IUGR, 2.46 [2.14-2.82]; and being a twin, 1.81 [1.43-2.29], p<0.0001. Relative to a cohort of infants who died of other causes, risk factors with a predilection for SIDS were maternal smoking, 2.48 [2.16-2.83] and being a twin, 1.52 [1.21-1.91], p<0.0001.Conclusions for practice: While certain socio-demographic and gestational characteristics are important risk factors, maternal smoking remains the strongest prenatal modifiable risk factor for SIDS. We recommend the continuation of Public Health initiatives that promote safe infant sleeping practices and smoking cessation during and after pregnancy.

AB Purpose: The aim of the current study was to investigate the psychopathological symptoms, psycho-emotional state, dream anxiety, and insomnia in healthy, mild and severe preeclamptic postpartum women and their relation to the severity of preeclampsia (PE).Materials and methods: This observational study included 45 healthy, 41 mild preeclamptic and 44 severe preeclamptic postpartum women. The 90-item Symptom Checklist Revised, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, and Van Dream Anxiety Scale (VDAS) were used to evaluate the psychopathological symptoms, psycho-emotional state, insomnia, and dream anxiety of the participants after delivery.Results: Severe preeclamptic women had higher VDAS scores than mild preeclamptic and healthy postpartum women (p: 0.001). The psychopathological symptoms were more frequent in preeclamptic women than in healthy controls (p: 0.001). Severe preeclamptic women had the highest scores in Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale and Insomnia Severity Index (p: 0.001, p: 0.001, respectively).Conclusion: Preeclampsia negatively affects the psycho-emotional state, psychopathological symptoms and sleep patterns. Further, disturbed dreaming was more frequent in PE and also, all of these conditions became worse with the severity of PE. We speculated that the obstetricians should offer their preeclamptic patients an appropriate mental health care at bedside and postpartum period as needed.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the potential risk factors associated independently with central serous retinopathy (CSR) in a Greek population, using multivariate approach.Materials and methods: Participants in the study were 183 consecutive patients diagnosed with CSR and 183 controls, matched for age. All participants underwent complete ophthalmological examination and information regarding their sociodemographic, clinical, medical and ophthalmological history were recorded, so as to assess potential risk factors for CSR. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed.Results: Univariate analysis showed that male sex, high educational status, high income, alcohol consumption, smoking, hypertension, coronary heart disease, obstructive sleep apnea, autoimmune disorders, H. pylori infection, type A personality and stress, steroid use, pregnancy and hyperopia were associated with CSR, while myopia was found to protect from CSR. In multivariate analysis, alcohol consumption, hypertension, coronary heart disease and autoimmune disorders lost their significance, while the remaining factors were all independently associated with CSR.Conclusions: It is important to take into account the various risk factors for CSR, so as to define vulnerable groups and to shed light into the pathogenesis of the disease.

AB Study Objectives: To estimate the association of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and its frequency with sleep-wake disturbances in pregnancy.
   Methods: A cohort of 1,563 women in their third trimester of pregnancy were recruited from prenatal clinics between March 2007 and December 2010. Demographic, pregnancy, and delivery data were extracted from medical records and sleep information was collected with questionnaires. To diagnose RLS, we used standardized criteria of RLS symptoms and frequency that were developed by the International Restless Legs Study Group. Logistic regression models were constructed to investigate the association of RLS and its frequency with sleep-wake disturbances (poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, poor daytime function) and delivery outcomes.
   Results: Overall 36% of the pregnant women had RLS, and half had moderate to severe symptoms. Compared to women without RLS, those with RLS were more likely to have poor sleep quality (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-2.9), poor daytime function (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.4), and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.0). A dose-response relationship also was evident between RLS frequency and each of the sleep-wake disturbances. There was no evidence for any association between RLS and delivery outcomes.
   Conclusions: RLS is a significant contributor to poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and poor daytime function, all common and often debilitating conditions in pregnancy. Obstetric health care providers should be aware of these associations and screen women for RLS.

AB Most premature infants born at less than 30 weeks gestation are exposed to periods of mild intermittent hypoxia (IH) associated with apnea of prematurity and periodic breathing. In adults, IH associated with sleep apnea causes neurochemical and structural alterations in the brain. However, it is unknown whether IH in the premature infant leads to neurodevelopmental impairment. Quantification of biochemical markers that can precisely identify infants at risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome is essential. In vivo H-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) facilitates the quantification of metabolites from distinct regions of the developing brain. We report the changes in metabolite profiles in the brainstem and hippocampal regions of developing rat brains, resulting from exposure to IH. Rat pups were chosen for study because there is rapid postnatal hippocampal development that occurs during the first 4 weeks in the developing rat brain, which corresponds to the first 2-3 postnatal years of development in humans. The brainstem was examined because of our interest in respiratory control disorders in the newborn and because of brainstem gliosis described in infants who succumb to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Metabolite profiles were compared between hypoxia treated rat pups (n = 9) and normoxic controls (n = 6). Metabolite profiles were acquired using the Point-RESolved spectroscopy (PRESS) MRS sequence and were quantified using the TARQUIN software. There was a significant difference in the concentrations of creatine (p = 0.031), total creatine (creatine + phosphocreatine) (p = 0.028), and total choline (p = 0.001) in the brainstem, and glycine (p = 0.031) in the hippocampal region. The changes are consistent with altered cellular bioenergetics and metabolism associated with hypoxic insult.

AB Aim: To transcultural adapt and analyze the reliability of Spanish version of Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory (PSI) and assess the prevalence of pregnancy symptoms in Spanish pregnant women.Materials and methods: A subsample of 120 healthy pregnant women answered the PSI twice and a sample of 280 report the prevalence and limitation of pregnancy symptoms. The reliability was examined by means of percent agreement and weighted Kappa coefficients. The prevalence of pregnancy symptoms was evaluated by the frequency of answers.Results: Perfect and perfect-acceptable agreement was observed in 82% and 96% of the pregnant women, respectively. Weighted Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.589 to 0.889, indicating a good reliability. The most frequent symptoms perceived by Spanish pregnant women were urinary frequency, poor sleep, increased vaginal discharge and tiredness.Conclusion: Spanish Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory is a brief, conceptually equivalent and satisfactory reliable tool that allows an early assessment of the wide range of pregnancy symptoms in the health care practices.

AB Objective: The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between changes in serotonin levels during pregnancy and fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) and the relationships between FS and the physical/psychological state, biochemical and hormonal parameters, which may be related to the musculoskeletal system.Study design: This study is a prospective case-control study conducted with 277 pregnant women at the obstetric unit of Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, in the period between January and June 2015. FS was determined based on the presence or absence of the 2010 ACR diagnostic criteria and all the volunteers were asked to answer the questionnaires as Fibromyalgia Impact Criteria (FIQ), Widespread Pain Index (WPI), Symptom Severity Scale (SS), Beck Depression Inventory and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Biochemical and hormonal markers (glucose, TSH, T4, Ca (calcium), P (phosphate), PTH (parathyroid hormone) and serotonin levels) relating to muscle and bone metabolism were measured.Results: In the presence of fibromyalgia, the physical and psychological parameters are negatively affected (p<0.001). There was no significant difference between the fibromyalgia and control groups in terms of glucose, Ca (calcium), P (phosphorus), PTH (parathyroid hormone), TSH (thyroid stimulant hormone), fT4 (free T4) levels (p=0.060, 0.799, 0.074, 0.104, 0.797, 0.929, respectively). A reduction in serotonin levels may contribute to the development of fibromyalgia but this was not statistically significant. The Beck Depression Inventory scale statistically showed that increasing scores also increase the risk of fibromyalgia (p<0.001).Conclusion: Our study has shown that serotonin levels in women with FS are lower than the control group and that serotonin levels reduce as pregnancy progresses. Anxiety and depression in pregnant women with FS are higher than the control group. The presence of depression increases the likelihood of developing FS at a statistically significant level. Serotonin impairment also increases the chance of developing FS, but this correlation has not been shown to be statistically significant.

SO CASE REPORTS IN MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; ADULTS
AB Sinus bradycardia which is a sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of less than 60 bpm is caused by intrinsic cardiac disorders like sick sinus syndrome or inferiormyocardial infarction, metabolic and environmental causes (such as hypothyroidism and electrolyte disorders), medications (such as beta-blockers and amiodarone), infection (such as myocarditis), increased intracranial pressure, and toxic exposure, while it can sometimes be a normal phenomenon, especially during sleep, in athletes, and during pregnancy. Symptomatic sinus bradycardia should warrant a thorough work-up in order to identify any reversible causes; otherwise, placement of a permanent pacemaker could be needed. We present the case of a patient who was admitted due to confusion and fever and was found to have pneumococcalmeningitis and bacteremia, and during his hospital stay he developed symptomatic sinus bradycardia that was of intractable cause and persistent. Placement of a permanent pacemaker was chosen until the night staff of the hospital discovered by chance the neglected cause of his bradycardia.

AB Objective: To determine the frequency of antenatal anxiety and depression and its risk profile including demographic, psychosocial and obstetric risk factors, in middle socioeconomic women.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out at two private hospital centres of Karachi, over a period of five months from October 2016 to March 2017. A questionnaire (age, education, parity, socioeconomic status, employment) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were the tools used to gather required information from pregnant women. Data collected was entered in SPSS 16 software. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate frequency and mean values. Logistic regression both binary and multinomial was performed to identify significant predictors of anxiety and depression.
   Results: Our study showed that out of 520 pregnant women, 130 (25%) women had anxiety, whereas 220 (42.3%) had depression. The mean age of women was 26.9 +/- 4.198 years. The range being from 18 years to 35 years. Significant risk factors among anxiety group were: working woman; 30.8% (p-value=0.000, OR=0.286), domestic violence; 84.6% (p-value=0.000, OR=2.8), difficult relationship with in-laws; 84.6% (p-value=0.000, OR=12.375), sleep disturbance; 76.9% (p-value=0.000, OR=9.667), primigravida; 23% (p-value=0.000, OR=2.576) and unplanned pregnancy; 23.1% (pvalue=0.029, OR=0.511).
   Significant risk factors among women with depression were: working woman; 31.8% (pvalue=0.000, OR=0.286), domestic violence; 68.2% (p-value=0.000, OR=3.571), difficult relationship with in-laws; 22.7% (p-value=0.000, OR=4.8), sleep disturbance; 54.5% (p-value=0.008, OR=2.0), primigravida; 45.5% (p-value=0.000, OR=17.246) and unplanned pregnancy; 18.2% (p-value=0.000, OR=3.0). Other factors that were found to be significant in the depression group only were: unsatisfactory relationship with husband; 22.7% (p-value=0.000, OR=4.118), stressful life event in previous year; 45.5% (p-value=0.000, OR=2.167), and tertiary education; 68.2% (p-value=0.002, OR=0.916).
   Conclusion: Psychosocial and demographic factors such as working woman, domestic violence, and difficult relationship with in-laws and sleep disturbance had a significant association with antenatal anxiety and depression. Obstetric risk factors were primigravida and unplanned pregnancy. Significant association with depression was unsatisfactory relationship with husband, stressful life event in a previous year and tertiary education.

AB Insomnia and disturbed sleep are common during pregnancy. This study investigated the effectiveness of group cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) delivered in pregnancy. Thirteen pregnant women with insomnia participated in five weekly CBT-I group sessions. All participants completed the study and provided baseline and follow-up data. Significant reductions in insomnia symptoms and increases in subjective sleep quality were observed over the course of the study. Diary and actigraphy assessments of sleep also changed, such that participants reported less time in bed (TIB), shorter sleep onset latency (SOL), increased sleep efficiency (SE), and increased subjective total sleep time (TST). Additionally, symptoms of depression, pregnancy-specific anxiety, and fatigue all decreased over the course of treatment. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large. CBT-I delivered during pregnancy was associated with significant improvements in sleep and mood. The next step in this area of inquiry is to better establish effectiveness via a randomized controlled trial.

AB Background
   Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common disease affecting about 5% to 15% of the population. Symptoms of RLS can be severe in a minority of and can have a major impact on sleep, mostly sleep initiation, and quality of life. Benzodiazepines are drugs that can induce and maintain sleep and, hence, intuitively are thought to be beneficial to people with RLS. Altough benzodiazepines, particularly clonazepam, are used to treat RLS symptoms, a systematic review done by the American Academy of SleepMedicine stated that benzodiazepines should not be used as a first-line treatment, although could be used as a coadjuvant therapy.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the efficacy and safety of benzodiazepine compared to placebo or other treatment for idiopathic RLS, including uncon-founded trials comparing benzodiazepines versus open control.
   Search methods
   In March 2016 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS We checked the references of each study and contacted study authors to identify any additional studies. We considered studies published in any language.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised clinical trials of benzodiazepine treatment in idiopathic RLS.
   Data collection and analysis
   We did not perform data collection and analysis, since we did not include any studies,
   Main results
   We did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria of the review. Two cross-over studies are awaiting classification because the cross-over trials did not give data at the end of the first cross-over period.
   Authors' conclusions
   The effectiveness of benzodiazepines for RLS treatment is currently unknown.

TI Infant pacifiers for reduction in risk of sudden infant death syndrome

   RECOMMENDATIONS; POPULATION; PATTERNS; POSITION; VICTIMS
AB Background Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been most recently defined as the sudden unexpected death of an infant less than one year of age, with onset of the fatal episode apparently occurring during sleep, that remains unexplained after a thorough investigation, including the performance of a complete autopsy and a review of the circumstances of death and clinical history. Despite the success of several prevention campaigns, SIDS remains a leading cause of infant mortality. In 1994, a 'triple risk model' for SIDS was proposed that described SIDS as an event that results from the intersection of three factors: a vulnerable infant; a critical development period in homeostatic control (age related); and an exogenous stressor. The association between pacifier (dummy) use and reduced incidence of SIDS has been shown in epidemiological studies since the early 1990s. Pacifier use, given its low cost, might be a cost-effective intervention for SIDS prevention if it is confirmed effective in randomised controlled trials.
   Objectives
   To determine whether the use of pacifiers during sleep versus no pacifier during sleep reduces the risk of SIDS.
   Search methods
   We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL to 16 March 2016. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.
   Selection criteria
   Published and unpublished controlled trials using random and quasi-random allocations of infants born at term and at preterm (less than 37 weeks' gestation) or with low birth weight (< 2500 g). Infants must have been randomised by one month' postmenstrual age. We planned to include studies reported only by abstracts, and cluster and cross-over randomised trials.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently reviewed studies from searches. We found no eligible studies.
   Main results
   We identified no randomised controlled trials examining infant pacifiers for reduction in risk of SIDS.
   Authors' conclusions
   We found no randomised control trial evidence on which to support or refute the use of pacifiers for the prevention of SIDS.

AB Hyperprolactinaemia especially affects women in reproductive age (90/100,000) but also often is diagnosed in menopause age and leads to disturbances in functioning of LH-RH neurons and, as a consequence, to a decrease of FSH and LH, which causes inhibition of oestradiol production. Prolactin is a peptide hormone, phylogenetically one of the oldest, stimulating cells of various organs, which is produced and secreted mainly by lactotrophic acidophilic cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary. It influences the increase in the mass of the mammary glands, and stimulation and maintenance of lactation after delivery. There are a number of factors apart of pregnancy, delivery, and lactation than can influence secretion of the hormone in other physiological and pathological circumstances, like high-protein diet, stress, REM sleep, or neoplastic tumours, inflammatory diseases, chronic systematic diseases, thyroid hormonal changes, and drug intake. The purpose of this review is to summarise the current knowledge regarding the proper diagnosis and possible influence of hyperprolactinaemia on fertility and menopause symptoms and current treatment methods.

AB OBJECTIVES: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is one of the widely used and recommended measures of assessing sleep quality in chronic insomnia; however certain psychometric properties of the questionnaire are still unknown in this group of patients. The present study aimed to examine the internal consistency, and structural and convergent validity of the Czech version of the PSQI in chronic insomnia patients. The usefulness of the standard and alternative scoring systems was also investigated in relation to symptoms of sleepiness, insomnia, depression, and anxiety.
   METHODS: In our study, 105 participants filled out a series of questionnaires including PSQI, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (BDI, BAI).
   RESULTS: The internal consistency of the questionnaire using Cronbach's alpha was 0.608. A series of confirmatory factor analyses revealed adequate fit for three structures. A three-factor model descriptively stood out among the rest but subsequent correlational analyses did not provide sufficient support for accepting an alternative scoring model.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the issue of structural variance of the PSQI and in chronic insomnia point to the important role of the PSQI components of daytime dysfunction and sleep disturbances in showing comorbid symptoms with daytime sleepiness and psychopathology.

AB Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor neurological disorder associated with poor quality of life. Growing evidence links RLS and periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS) with increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. This article reviews the association of RLS and PLMS with cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Methods: PubMed and Medline database (1990 to July 2016) were searched for the terms "restless legs," "restless legs syndrome," "periodic limb movements," "periodic limb movements in sleep" cross-referenced with "cardiovascular disease," "heart disease," "coronary artery disease," "coronary heart disease," "heart arrhythmia," "heart failure," " congestive heart failure," "echocardiogram," "echocardiographic," "hypertension," "high blood pressure," "cerebrovascular disease," "stroke," "autonomic nervous system," "heart rate," "heart rate variability," "hypoxia," "microcirculation," "oxidative stress," "inflammation," "chronic kidney disease," "end-stage renal disease," "renaldisease," "hemodialysis," "multiple sclerosis," "Parkinson," "Parkinson's," "iron deficiency anemia," and "mortality." Other relevant articles from the reference list of the above-matched manuscripts were also reviewed. Studies that did not specify the diagnostic criteria for RLS or manuscripts in languages other than English were excluded. Articles with emphasis in RLS secondary to pregnancy were not included in this manuscript.
   Results: Eighty-six original articles were included in this review. Although mixed results were found regarding the association of RLS and PLMS with CVD, hypertension, stroke and mortality, an informal review of the literature does suggest that the bulk of the evidence favors such an association.
   Conclusion: The current evidence in general supports the association between RLS/PLMS and CVD. The variability of results likely represent differences in study designs, RLS criteria used, RLS severity, duration of disease, and time of follow-up between the studies. As the association between RLS/PLMS and CVD is not definitive at this time, further suggested studies are outlined.

AB One-quarter of neonatal deaths are attributed to infections. Maternal handwashing with soap may prevent neonatal sepsis. We examined impact of intensive handwashing promotion on handwashing behavior of mothers of neonates. In Matlab, Bangladesh, we randomly allocated pregnant women at 28-32 weeks' gestation to intensive handwashing promotion or control. Behavior change communicators used a participatory approach to motivate maternal handwashing with soap and provided soap and handwashing stations. In the neonatal period, we observed soap and water at handwashing places and, at the end of the neonatal period, we estimated impact on maternal handwashing by structured observation. Among 253 women enrolled, intervention households were between 5.7 and 15.2 times as likely as control households to have soap and water present at the handwashing station in the baby's sleeping area. Intervention mothers washed hands with soap 4.1 times as frequently as controls (95% CI 2.55-6.59); handwashing with soap at recommended times was infrequent in both intervention (9%) and control (2%) groups. Intensively promoting handwashing with soap resulted in increased availability of soap and water at handwashing places, but only a modest increase in maternal handwashing with soap. Novel approaches to motivating handwashing behavior to protect newborns should be developed and evaluated.

AB Background: Although stress during pregnancy has negative effects on children's development and pregnant women's health, no study has assessed stress and its predictors among pregnant Saudi women. The aim of this study was to assess stress and identify its predictors in a sample of pregnant Saudi women.
   Methods: A correlational study was carried out at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, on 438 pregnant women who attended the obstetrics/gynecology clinic. We collected data on their sociodemographic and oral health status. Stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).
   Results: The sample mean age was 30.6 +/- 5.4 years, and 33.4% of the sample reported high stress levels (PSS >= 20). The study revealed significantly high stress levels in women with no or low income, chronic disease, sleep deprivation, no teeth brushing, irregular eating patterns, gestational diabetes, and no family support (P < 0.05). Self-reported oral health problems were significantly associated with high stress levels (P < 0.05). A multiple linear regression model showed that no teeth brushing, chronic disease, sleep deprivation, gestational diabetes, and gingival redness predicted an increase in stress by a score of 3.6, 2.4, 2.1, 1.4, and 1.4, respectively.
   Conclusion: It was estimated that three in ten pregnant women in King Abdulaziz Medical City reported high stress levels. Our study shed light on the relationship between healthy habits, oral health status, and perceived stress in pregnant women. This research may help health care practitioners who provide care to pregnant women, to educate them in regard to healthy habits, and to develop a program to reduce stress.

AB This study is a follow-up to our previous research of the phenomenology and mechanisms of motion sickness (MS) and its relationship with changes in the sleep-wake cycle (SWC). We report data on the effect of MS on the SWC in 30-day-old intact rats and those exposed to prenatal hypoxia on days 13 and 19 of gestation. In all animal groups, MS was shown to decrease significantly the waking time and increase that of paradoxical sleep (PS). A link between hypothalamic MS and SWC regulatory mechanisms was revealed, and the role of this teamwork in the development of the sopite syndrome, which may be a sole manifestation of MS in some animals and man, was suggested. It was established that hypoxic exposure on day 19 of gestation had a greater damaging effect on the thalamocortical sleep-regulating structures than that on day 13, when it is only the hypothalamic-hippocampal slow-sleep regulatory systems that were found to be affected. Against this background, MS appreciably suppresses the brain excitatory systems that maintain wakefulness (supposed to be the ascending reticular activating system) and enhances those activating systems that regulate PS. It is exactly prenatal hypoxic exposure of rats on day 19 of gestation that enabled demonstrating the role of the evolutionarily young thalamocortical system in PS control.

AB The patient is a 1-week-old boy born at 37+2 weeks' gestational age through spontaneous vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and pre-eclampsia. The Apgar score was 9 at both 1 minute and 5 minutes after birth. Because of hypoglycemia at delivery that required IV dextrose, he was admitted to the local neonatal intensive care unit. His blood glucose levels quickly stabilized, dextrose administration was discontinued, and the patient began breast-feeding. On day 2 of life, the patient began having intermittent oxygen desaturation, with oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry down to 70% while sleeping; he was transferred to a tertiary-care NICU for further management. Aside from the hypoxia, he was otherwise asymptomatic.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how socio-cultural beliefs and practices could influence the knowledge, attitude and perception of insecticide-treated net (ITN) use in the control of malaria amongst pregnant women attending antenatal clinic.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were gathered using interviews and documentary review. Framework analysis was applied to classify emerging themes and the findings interpreted using the health belief model.
   Findings - The findings showed that the pregnant women had appreciable knowledge, both the positive and negative attitudes and the perceptions of insecticide treated nets. To most of them, sleeping under an ITN would not affect pregnancy/cause abortion, but rather prevent mosquito bites and associated malaria.
   Research limitations/implications - The limitations include the sample size of participants and health facilities used. Lack of application of a quantitative research method meant that the authors could not quantify the findings to ensure generalisation to the entire population.
   Practical implications - The findings suggest that health policy makers, implementers and health professionals need to appreciate the perception and the attitude of pregnant women when designing policy guidelines for the malaria control programme.
   Social implications - This paper helps to elucidate on how socio-cultural beliefs and practices could influence the knowledge, attitude and perception of ITN usage amongst both pregnant women and people in malaria endemic communities.
   Originality/value - This paper suggests that health policy makers, implementers and health professionals have to devise strategies to address socio-cultural beliefs and practices in the scaling up of malaria control programmes.

AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in pregnancy is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality to both mother and foetus. In the South African setting the proportion of pregnant females suffering from OSA has not been well studied; nor has the association with pre-eclampsia. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of OSA in females before 35 weeks gestation using the STOP-BANG questionnaire and to determine the association with pre-eclampsia in a local South African setting.
   Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study including 234 patients was conveniently sampled from Kalafong Hospital's antenatal ward, clinic and labour ward. Participants were of more than 20 weeks and less than 35 weeks gestation. All participants were interviewed with a modified STOP-BANG questionnaire. Patients were consecutively enrolled without prior knowledge of the presence of pre-eclampsia. At Kalafong hospital all pregnant patients are routinely screened and investigated for pre-eclampsia according to standard criteria.
   Results: The median gestational age in this sample was 28 weeks; 80.3% (CI 74.62-85.2%) of pregnant females had a low risk for OSA, 15.4% (CI 11.01-20.65%) had an intermediate risk and 3% (CI 6.47-14.58%) had a high risk for OSA. A modified STOP-BANG questionnaire had a sensitivity of 62.5% and a specificity of 82.1% for pre-eclampsia when a score of 3 and more was scored. Females at high risk of OSA had an OR of 8.4 (CI 2.88-24.6) for having pre-eclampsia.
   Conclusions: The authors report 15.4% of the study's pregnant population to be at intermediate risk and 3% at high risk of OSA. The association between the hypertensive disorders and OSA must be considered and screening implementation considered.

AB Circadian preference toward eveningness has been associated with increased risk for mental health problems both in early adolescence and in adulthood. However, in late adolescence, when circadian rhythm naturally shifts to later, its significance for mental health is not clear. Accordingly, we studied how circadian rhythm estimated both by self-reported chronotype and by actigraph-defined midpoint of sleep was associated with self-reported psychiatric problems based on Youth Self Report (YSR). The study builds on a community cohort born in 1998, Helsinki, Finland. At age 17 years (mean age = 16.9, SD = 0.1 years), 183 adolescents (65.6% of the invited) participated in the study. We used the shortened version of the Horne-Ostberg morningness-eveningness Questionnaire to define the chronotype, and actigraphs to define the naturally occur circadian rhythm over a 4 to 17 days' period (mean nights N = 8.3, SD = 1.8). The Achenbach software was used to obtain T-score values for YSR psychiatric problem scales. The analyses were adjusted for important covariates including gender, socioeconomic status, body mass index, pubertal maturation, mother's licorice consumption during pregnancy, and actigraph-defined sleep duration and quality. Eveningness was associated with higher scores in rule-breaking behavior and conduct problems (as assessed either by midpoint of sleep or by self-reported chronotype, p-values <0.05), attention deficit/hyperactivity problems (by self-reported chronotype, p-values <0.05), with affective problems (by midpoint of sleep and by self-reported chronotype, p-values <0.05) and somatic complaints (by self-reported chronotype, p-values <0.05), as compared to circadian tendency toward morningness. Our results suggest that the association between eveningness and externalizing problem behavior, present in children and younger adolescents, is also present in late adolescence when circadian rhythms shift toward evening.

AB Fatigue during pregnancy is a physiological, psychological, and potentially pathological condition of decreased energy. Many pregnant women experience fatigue during the first trimester and the third trimester. While fatigue usually reduces during the second trimester, some women experience fatigue throughout pregnancy which is likely to cause discomfort and affect daily living. An overview of fatigue discomfort during pregnancy can help distinguish normal fatigue from clinical manifestation and educate women on self-care measures and when to seek medical care.

AB An area that is often overlooked in the assessment of pregnant women is that of sleep. Women experience various forms of sleep changes during the perinatal period that are specific to the different trimesters. The literature suggests that sleep changes and resulting sleep deficits impact pregnant women in numerous ways, including both the physiological and psychological domains. Importantly, mood alterations associated with poor sleep quality can manifest as anxiety and depression. This article reviews sleep changes associated with pregnancy, highlights some outcomes that can occur from sleep disturbances, and suggests some interventions to promote improved sleep quality in pregnant women.

AB Background: Although a large number of studies have investigated possible relationships among serum levels of vitamin D or cytokines with disease progress and prognosis, similar studies on self-reported symptoms are still controversial. The overall objective of this study was to look into the association between serum levels of vitamin D or cytokines with self-reported symptoms related to musculoskeletal pain, sleep disorders, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in healthy adult women.
   Subjects and methods: Venous blood samples were collected from 117 healthy adult women, and serum levels of vitamin D, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13) were measured. Groups were tested for differences in single parameters, pro-: anti-inflammatory cytokine ratios, and differences in multivariate patterns.
   Results: There were no significant associations between serum levels of vitamin D and any of the self-reported symptoms studied. However, serum levels of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in subjects with musculoskeletal pain (IL-8, P=0.008), sleep disorders (IFN-gamma, P=0.02), and PMS (IL-8 and TNF-alpha, P=0.009 and 0.002, respectively) compared to subjects who reported no symptoms. The pro-: anti-inflammatory cytokine ratios showed pro-inflammatory cytokine dominance in subjects with self-reported symptoms, particularly in the groups with deficient levels of vitamin D. However, the multivariate cytokine-pattern analysis was significantly different between PMS groups only.
   Conclusion: These data point to a possible role of pro-inflammatory cytokines as a contributing factor in self-reported symptoms related to musculoskeletal pain, sleep disorders, and PMS.

AB A series of schiff base derivatives of 4-aminophenazone (4APZ-1,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one) with different aldehydes were synthesized. The synthetic compounds were screened for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities. The characterization of synthesized compounds was carried out by H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and MS. Carrageenan-induced paw oedema (CIPO) and histamine induced paw oedema (HIPO) methods were used to determine the anti-inflammatory activity of commercial sample of 4APZ and its synthesized schiff bases in mice. The anti-inflammatory activity was in the order of 4APZAB > 4APZBB > 4APZCB > 4APZVn and all the test compounds exhibited considerable dose dependent inhibition of the paw oedema. The effect of the compounds on membrane stabilization was also determined which showed that compounds 4APZ (120 and 240 mg/kg doses), 4APZAB (160 mg/kg) and 4APZVn (600 mg/kg) produced highly significant inhibition (P < 0.001) of hypotonicity-induced haemolysis. Further, it was also observed that 4APZ (120 and 240 mg/kg doses), 4APZBB (500 mg/kg) and APZCB (150, 300 and 600 mg/kg dose) produced highly significant inhibition (P < 0.001) of albumin denaturation; a consistent dose dependent anti-inflammatory effect of test compounds as compared to the standard drug. Analgesic activity of the compounds was investigated by formalin-induced paw licking (FIPL) and acetic acid-induced writhing (AIW) methods in mice. It was observed that 4APZ (240 mg/kg), 4APZAB (160 mg/kg), 4APZBB (500 mg/kg), 4APZCB (600 mg/kg) and 4APZVn (600 mg/kg) showed analgesic effect with highly significant (P < 0.001) reduction of paw licking and writhing activity in the treated mice. The order of analgesic effect of the compounds was 4APZAB > 4APZBB > 4APZVn > 4APZCB. Moreover, phenobarbitone-induced sleeping time (PIST) in mice was also studied but only 600 mg/kg of 4APZVn significantly increased the duration of induced sleep which also suggested its sedative property. Brewer's yeast was used to induce fever in rabbits and analysed the compounds for their antipyretic activity. Different doses of 4APZ for different time durations (240 mg/kg-after 1 h, 120 and 240 mg/kg doses-after 2 h) produced highly significant (P < 0.001) inhibition of hyperpyrexia. Other compounds showed good antipyretic activity after 2, 3 and 4 h. (C) 2014 King Saud University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

AB Executive function deficits are among the most frequent sequela of very preterm birth but the underlying neuronal mechanisms are not fully understood. We used high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during sleep to assess alterations in the functional neuroanatomy of executive processes in adolescents born very preterm. The topographical distribution of sleep slow wave activity (SWA; 1-4.5 Hz EEG power) has previously been used to map cognitive abilities and is known to reflect the intensity of the prior use of the respective neuronal networks. We assessed 38 adolescents born before 32 weeks of gestation [age at assessment: 12.9 (SD: 1.7), range: 10.6-16.7 years] and 43 term-born peers [13.1 (2.0), 10.0-16.9]. Executive function abilities were quantified with a composite score derived from a comprehensive task battery. All-night high density EEG (128 electrodes) was recorded and SWA of the first hour of sleep was calculated. Abilities were significantly poorer in the very preterm compared to the term group, particularly, if the tasks demands were high (p < .01). The score was positively correlated with sleep SWA in a cluster of 15 electrodes over frontal and negatively in a cluster of 14 electrodes over central brain regions after controlling for age at assessment and correcting for multiple comparisons. Within the frontal cluster, sleep SWA was higher in very preterm compared to term-born participants when controlling for executive function performance and age at assessment (p = .02). No difference in SWA between very preterm and term-born participants was found for the central cluster (p = .29). Our results demonstrate a local increase of sleep SWA over brain regions associated with executive processes in adolescents born very preterm compared to similarly performing term-born peers. Thus, sleep SWA seems to map the higher effort needed for executive function tasks in adolescents born very preterm. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Study objectives: Maternal and paternal sleep insufficiency during pregnancy appears to be a risk factor for health and wellbeing in young families. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of sleep insufficiency and symptoms of insomnia during pregnancy (at 32nd pregnancy week) and their relationship to depression, anxiety and environmental stress.
   Methods: The study is based on a population based sample from Finland consisting of 1667 mothers and 1498 fathers from the Child-sleep birth cohort. We evaluated both the core symptoms of insomnia (sleep onset problems, nocturnal awakenings, too-early awakenings, and poor sleep quality) and the presence of insufficient sleep. Insufficient sleep was defined as a two-hour difference between self-assessed sleep need and reported sleep duration, or sleep duration shorter than six hours per night.
   Results: We found that symptoms of insomnia were more prevalent among women than among men (9.8%vs.6.2%), whereas sleep debt was less prevalent among women than among men (4.5%vs.9.6%). Overall, 11.8% of the women and 14.9% of the men reported either significant insomnia or short sleep. Symptoms of insomnia were related to symptoms of depression both among women and men (AOR 3.8, 95% CI 2.6-5.6 vs. AOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.2), while short sleep was related to depression among women (AOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.8-5.8), and to low education, poor health and a larger number of children among men.
   Conclusions: The study showed that insomnia and sleep insufficiency are prevalent among women and men during pregnancy. The findings underline the impact of insomnia to both maternal and paternal health during pregnancy as well as to the implementation of effective interventions to prevent negative consequences of sleep disturbances.

AB Category mistakes are sentences such as 'The number two is blue' or 'Green ideas sleep furiously'. Such sentences are highly infelicitous and thus a prominent view claims that they are meaningless. Category mistakes are also highly prevalent in figurative language. That is to say, it is very common for sentences which are used figuratively to be such that, if taken literally, they would constitute category mistakes. (Consider for example the metaphor 'The poem is pregnant', the metonymy 'The White House decided to change its policy', or a fictional use of 'The tree was happy'.) In this paper I argue that the view that category mistakes are meaningless is inconsistent with many central and otherwise plausible theories of figurative language. Thus if the meaninglessness view is correct, the theories in question must each be rejected, and conversely, if any of the theories in question is correct, the meaninglessness view must be wrong. The debates concerning the semantics of figurative language and concerning the semantic status of category mistakes are closely connected.

AB Aim: The present observational study aimed to clarify the effects of sleep disorders on threatened premature delivery, especially preterm uterine contraction.
   Methods: The participants included 122 healthy singleton pregnant women. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index was used to evaluate the quality of sleep during the-previous month at the initial examination and at 16, 24, and 32 weeks of gestation; scores >5 indicate poor sleep. Threatened premature delivery was defined as preterm uterine contraction >6 times/h and requiring tocolytic therapy before 37 weeks of gestation. We analyzed the relationship between poor sleep and threatened premature delivery.
   Results: Poor sleep affected 27% (n = 33) at the initial examination, 34% (n = 41) at 16 weeks, 37% (n = 45) at 24 weeks, and 41% (n = 50) at 32 weeks of gestation. There were 23 patients (19%) with threatened premature delivery. Poor sleep affected 35% and 25% of patients with threatened and non-threatened premature delivery at the initial examination, respectively, 52% and 29% at 16 weeks, 48% and 34% at 24 weeks, and 43% and 40% at 32 weeks of gestation.
   Conclusions: Sleep disorders at 16 weeks of gestation were the most significantly associated with threatened premature delivery.

AB Background: Daytime sleepiness is a frequent complaint in women during pregnancy. It has also been linked to negative obstetric consequences. Although high prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness throughout pregnancy is well-documented, neither the causes of persistent daytime sleepiness nor new onset daytime sleepiness during pregnancy have been investigated. Identifying predictive factors may play an important role in the management of daytime sleepiness in pregnant women and improve prenatal care and maternal-fetal outcomes.
   Objectives: To examine first-trimester maternal characteristics associated with the persistence and new onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women.
   Design: A longitudinal, prospective cohort design.
   Setting: One medical center in Taipei, Taiwan and participating women's homes.
   Participants: A total of 204 pregnant women.
   Methods: First-trimester pregnant women recruited from an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center provided socio-demographic and health information, wore an actigraphy monitor for 7 days, and completed sleep, mood, and daytime sleepiness questionnaires. Data were collected again when the women were in the second and third trimester.
   Results: Thirty-one (15.2%) women experienced excessive daytime sleepiness that persisted across all three trimesters. Nulliparous women and women who snored in the first trimester were 2.28 and 2.10 times more at risk of being classified of persistent daytime sleepiness than multiparous women and women who did not snore in the first trimester, respectively. Thirty-one (15.2%) women developed new onset daytime sleepiness with advancing gestation. Women were more likely to develop new-onset daytime sleepiness if they worked longer hours per week (OR= 1.04, p < 0.001), if they reported snoring (OR= 6.75, p < 0.001), and if they had elevated depressive symptoms in the first trimester of pregnancy (OR= 1.09, p = 0.01).
   Conclusions: Snoring in the first trimester is involved in both the persistence and new-onset of daytime sleepiness with elevated depressive symptoms related to new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. Findings suggest that intervention strategies for alleviating daytime sleepiness in pregnant women should focus on managing snoring and symptoms of depression in early trimesters with special attention to nulliparous and employed women.

AB The symptoms of asthma, breathlessness, insomnia, etc. all have relevance to pulmonary rhythmic disturbances. Epidemiology and toxicology studies have demonstrated that exposure to ambient air particles can result in pulmonary dysfunction. However, there are no data directly supporting a link between air pollution and circadian rhythm disorder. In the present study, we found that breathing highly polluted air resulted in changes of the molecular clock genes expression in lung by transcriptome profiling analyses in a rodent model. Compared to those exposed to filtered air, in both pregnant and offspring rats in the unfiltered group, key clock genes (Per1, Per2, Per3, Rev-erb alpha and Dbp) expression level decreased and Bmal1 expression level increased. In both rat dams and their offspring, after continuous exposure to unfiltered air, we observed significant histologic evidence for both perivascular and peribronchial inflammation, increased tissue and systemic oxidative stress in the lungs. Our results suggest that chronic exposure to particulate matter can induce alterations of clock genes expression, which could be another important pathway for explaining the feedbacks of ambient particle exposure in addition to oxidative stress and inflammation.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy is a risk factor for the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
   METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, nulliparous women underwent in-home sleep-disordered breathing assessments in early (6-15 weeks of gestation) and midpregnancy (22-31 weeks of gestation). Participants and health care providers were blinded to the sleep test results. An apnea-hypopnea index of 5 or greater was used to define sleep-disordered breathing. Exposure-response relationships were examined, grouping participants into four apnea-hypopnea index groups: 0, greater than 0 to less than 5, 5 to less than 15, and 15 or greater. The study was powered to test the primary hypothesis that sleep-disordered breathing occurring in pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes were rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, defined as preeclampsia and antepartum gestational hypertension, and GDM. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.
   RESULTS: Three thousand seven hundred five women were enrolled. Apnea-hypopnea index data were available for 3,132 (84.5%) and 2,474 (66.8%) women in early and midpregnancy, respectively. The corresponding prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was 3.6% and 8.3%. The prevalence of preeclampsia was 6.0%, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 13.1%, and GDM 4.1%. In early and midpregnancy the adjusted odds ratios for preeclampsia when sleep-disordered breathing was present were 1.94 (95% CI 1.07-3.51) and 1.95 (95% CI 1.18-3.23), respectively; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 1.46 (95% CI 0.91-2.32) and 1.73 (95% CI 1.192.52); and GDM 3.47 (95% CI 1.95-6.19) and 2.79 (95% CI 1.63-4.77). Increasing exposure-response relationships were observed between apnea-hypopnea index and both hypertensive disorders and GDM.
   CONCLUSION: There is an independent association between sleep-disordered breathing and preeclampsia, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and GDM.

AB Background: Synchronizing eating schedules to daily circadian rhythms may improve metabolic health, but its association with gestational glycemia is unknown.
   Objective: This study examined the association of maternal night-fasting intervals and eating episodes with blood glucose concentrations during pregnancy.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study within a prospective cohort in Singapore. Maternal 24-h dietary recalls, fasting glucose, and 2-h glucose concentrations were ascertained at 26-28 wk gestation for 1061 women (aged 30.7 +/- 5.1 y). Night-fasting intervals were based on the longest fasting duration during the night (1900-0659). Eating episodes were defined as events that provided >50 kcal, with a time interval between eating episodes of >= 15 min. Multiple linear regressions with adjustment for confounders were conducted.
   Results: Mean +/- SD night-fasting intervals and eating episodes per day were 9.9 +/- 1.6 h and 4.2 +/- 1.3 times/d, respectively; fasting and 2-h glucose concentrations were 4.4 +/- 0.5 and 6.6 +/- 1.5 mmol/L, respectively. In adjusted models, each hourly increase in night-fasting intervals was associated with a 0.03 mmol/L decrease in fasting glucose (95% CI: -0.06, -0.01 mmol/L), whereas each additional daily eating episode was associated with a 0.15 mmol/L increase in 2-h glucose (95% CI: 0.03; 0.28 mmol/L). Conversely, night-fasting intervals and daily eating episodes were not associated with 2-h and fasting glucose, respectively.
   Conclusions: Increased maternal night-fasting intervals and reduced eating episodes per day were associated with decreased fasting glucose and 2-h glucose, respectively, in the late-second trimester of pregnancy. This points to potential alternative strategies to improve glycemic control in pregnant women. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875.

AB Background. Prenatal maternal obesity has been linked to adverse childhood neuropsychiatric outcomes, including increased symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), internalizing and externalizing problems, affective disorders and neurodevelopmental problems but few studies have studied neuropsychiatric outcomes among offspring born to very severely obese women or assessed potential familial confounding by maternal psychological distress.
   Method. We evaluated neuropsychiatric symptoms in 112 children aged 3-5 years whose mothers had participated in a longitudinal study of obesity in pregnancy (50 very severe obesity, BMI >= 40 kg/m(2), obese class III and 62 lean, BMI 18.5-25 kg/m(2)). The mothers completed the Conners' Hyperactivity Scale, Early Symptomatic Syndrome Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examination Questionnaire (ESSENCE-Q), Child's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess child neuropsychiatric symptoms. Covariates included child's sex, age, birthweight, gestational age, socioeconomic deprivation levels, maternal age, parity, smoking status during pregnancy, gestational diabetes and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed using State Anxiety of Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), respectively.
   Results. Children exposed to prenatal maternal very severe obesity had significantly higher scores in the Conners' Hyperactivity Scale; ESSENCE-Q; total sleep problems in CSHQ; hyperactivity, conduct problems and total difficulties scales of the SDQ; higher externalizing and total problems, anxious/depressed, aggressive behaviour and other problem syndrome scores and higher DSM-oriented affective, anxiety and ADHD problems in CBCL. Prenatal maternal very severe obesity remained a significant predictor of child neuropsychiatric problems across multiple scales independent of demographic factors, prenatal factors and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression.
   Conclusions. Prenatal maternal very severe obesity is a strong predictor of increased neuropsychiatric problems in early childhood.

AB AimsTo examine the association between sleep disturbances during pregnancy and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus.
   MethodsFrom 2010 to 2012, 12 506 women in Tianjin, China, were screened using a 50-g 1-h glucose challenge test at 24-28 weeks' gestation. Those with glucose challenge test values of 7.8 mmol/l were invited to further undergo a 75-g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test. Gestational diabetes was determined according to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group's definition. Self-reported sleep duration and sleep quality during pregnancy was documented using a modified questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios and 95% CIs.
   ResultsA total of 919 women (7.3%) had gestational diabetes. Sleep duration was found to have an approximate J-shaped association with gestational diabetes risk after adjusting for covariates. Compared with a sleep duration of 7-9 h/day (43% of 12 506 women), the adjusted odds ratios for sleep duration of 9 h/day (55%) and < 7 h/day (2%) for gestational diabetes were 1.21 (95% CI 1.03-1.42) and 1.36 (95% CI 0.87-2.14), respectively. Compared with good sleep quality (37.9% of 12 506 women), the adjusted odds ratios of moderate (59.9%) and poor sleep quality (2.2%) for gestational diabetes were 1.19 (95% CI 1.01-1.41) and 1.61 (95% CI 1.04-2.50), respectively.
   ConclusionIn pregnant Chinese women, poor sleep quality, and shorter and longer duration of sleep during pregnancy were independently associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes.
   What's new?
   Sleep disturbances increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus but it is uncertain whether they also increase the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Using a large prospective population-based study of Chinese pregnant women, this study is the first to report that suboptimum sleep quality as well as shorter and longer sleep duration during pregnancy were associated with increased risk of gestational diabetes, the latter being presented by an approximately J-shaped risk relationship.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a type of ubiquitous pollutant with the potential ability to cause endocrine disruption that would have an adverse health impact on the general population. To assess the maternal exposure to PAHs in neonates and evaluate the possible impact of PAHs on reproductive hormone levels, the concentration of PAHs and reproductive hormone levels in the umbilical cord serum of 98 mother-infant pairs in the Shengsi Islands were investigated. The median concentration of total PAHs was determined to be 164 (Inter-Quartile Range, IQR 93.6-267) ng g(-1) lipid, and 68% of the PAHs were lower-molecule congeners. The highest level was found for pyrene (PYR) and naphthalene (NAP), which contributed 54.6% of all the PAHs present in the samples. The exposure to PAHs negatively affected estradiol (E2) and Anti-Mullerian hormones (AMH) and positively affected FSH in the umbilical cord serum. The result expanded the database of the human burden of PAHs and suggested that PAHs can act as a type of Endocrine-Disrupting Chemical (EDC). These results may help to understand the complex pathways involved in disorders of human reproductive health associated with prenatal exposure to PAHs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gravity has played a critical role in the development of terrestrial life. A key event in evolution has been the development of mechanisms to sense and transduce gravitational force into biological signals. The objective of this manuscript is to review how living organisms on Earth use mechanotransduction as an adaptation to gravity. Certain cells have evolved specialized structures, such as otoliths in hair cells of the inner ear and statoliths in plants, to respond directly to the force of gravity. By conducting studies in the reduced gravity of spaceflight (microgravity) or simulating microgravity in the laboratory, we have gained insights into how gravity might have changed life on Earth. We review how microgravity affects prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells at the cellular and molecular levels. Genomic studies in yeast have identified changes in genes involved in budding, cell polarity, and cell separation regulated by Ras, PI3K, and TOR signaling pathways. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis of late pregnant rats have revealed that microgravity affects genes that regulate circadian clocks, activate mechanotransduction pathways, and induce changes in immune response, metabolism, and cells proliferation. Importantly, these studies identified genes that modify chromatin structure and methylation, suggesting that long-term adaptation to gravity may be mediated by epigenetic modifications. Given that gravity represents a modification in mechanical stresses encounter by the cells, the tensegrity model of cytoskeletal architecture provides an excellent paradigm to explain how changes in the balance of forces, which are transmitted across transmembrane receptors and cytoskeleton, can influence intracellular signaling pathways and gene expression.

AB Background
   Few studies have looked at the relationship between psychological and the mental health status of pregnant women in rural China. The current study aims to explore the potential mediating effect of negative automatic thoughts between negative life events and antenatal depression.
   Methods
   Data were collected in June 2012 and October 2012. 495 rural pregnant women were interviewed. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale, stresses of pregnancy were measured by the pregnancy pressure scale, negative automatic thoughts were measured by the automatic thoughts questionnaire, and negative life events were measured by the life events scale for pregnant women. We used logistic regression and path analysis to test the mediating effect.
   Results
   The prevalence of antenatal depression was 13.7%. In the logistic regression, the only socio-demographic and health behavior factor significantly related to antenatal depression was sleep quality. Negative life events were not associated with depression in the fully adjusted model. Path analysis showed that the eventual direct and general effects of negative automatic thoughts were 0.39 and 0.51, which were larger than the effects of negative life events.
   Conclusions
   This study suggested that there was a potentially significant mediating effect of negative automatic thoughts. Pregnant women who had lower scores of negative automatic thoughts were more likely to suffer less from negative life events which might lead to antenatal depression.

AB Objective
   Acupuncture has become popular and widely practiced in many countries around the world. Despite the large amount of acupuncture-related literature that has been published, broader trends in the prevalence and scope of acupuncture research remain underexplored. The current study quantitatively analyzes trends in acupuncture research publications in the past 20 years.
   Methods
   A bibliometric approach was used to search PubMed for all acupuncture-related research articles including clinical and animal studies. Inclusion criteria were articles published between 1995 and 2014 with sufficient information for bibliometric analyses. Rates and patterns of acupuncture publication within the 20 year observational period were estimated, and compared with broader publication rates in biomedicine. Identified eligible publications were further analyzed with respect to study type/design, clinical condition addressed, country of origin, and journal impact factor.
   Results
   A total of 13,320 acupuncture-related publications were identified using our search strategy and eligibility criteria. Regression analyses indicated an exponential growth in publications over the past two decades, with a mean annual growth rate of 10.7%. This compares to a mean annual growth rate of 4.5% in biomedicine. A striking trend was an observed increase in the proportion of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), from 7.4% in 1995 to 20.3% in 2014, exceeding the 4.5% proportional growth of RCTs in biomedicine. Over the 20 year period, tions). Other top rankings with respect to medical focus were arthritis, neoplasms/cancer, pregnancy or labor, mood disorders, stroke, nausea/vomiting, sleep, and paralysis/palsy. Acupuncture research was conducted in 60 countries, with the top 3 contributors being China (47.4%), United States (17.5%), and United Kingdom (8.2%). Retrieved articles were published mostly in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) journals with impact factors ranging between 0.7 and 2.8 in the top 20 journals, followed by journals specializing in neuroscience, pain, anesthesia/analgesia, internal medicine and comprehensive fields.
   Conclusion
   Acupuncture research has grown markedly in the past two decades, with a 2-fold higher growth rate than for biomedical research overall. Both the increases in the proportion of RCTs and the impact factor of journals support that the quality of published research has improved. While pain was a consistently dominant research focus, other topics gained more attention during this time period. These findings provide a context for analyzing strengths and gaps in the current state of acupuncture research, and for informing a comprehensive strategy for further advancing the field.

ID PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; PERSONALITY; STUDENTS; COHORT; INDEX
AB Background: During pregnancy, due to special hormonal and physiological changes that occur in the body, sleep disorders are very prevalent; therefore, positive psychological states and emotions can have major impacts on overall sleep quality among pregnant women.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of 15 positive psychological states (trust in God, optimism, a sense of efficacy, accepting responsibilities, a sense of control, purposefulness, hope, meaningfulness in life, life satisfaction, positive mood and happiness, being social, self-esteem and self-worth, a sense of peace, appreciation, and forgiveness) on predicting sleep quality among pregnant women.
   Materials and Methods: This descriptive study followed a correlational-predictive design. The statistical population of this study included all pregnant women referred to health care centers in Khash in the first half of 2015, which included 890 individuals. The sampling method was multistage cluster sampling. Overall, 268 questionnaires were distributed among pregnant women, who had the inclusion criteria of the current study, in order to be answer freely and voluntarily. Moreover, to collect data, two questionnaires including positive psychological states (PPS) and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) were used.
   Results: The results of the correlation coefficient indicated that optimism, purposefulness, hope, meaningfulness in life, life satisfaction, positive mood and happiness, a sense of peace, trust in God and forgiveness were significantly related to high sleep quality (P <= 0.01). However, sleep quality was not correlated with a sense of efficacy, accepting responsibilities, a sense of control, being social, and a sense of self-esteem and self-worth (P >= 0.05). Additionally, the results of stepwise regression analysis showed that positives mood, meaningfulness in life and hope together predicted 0.47 of the variance in sleep quality among pregnant women (P <= 0.01).
   Conclusions: Since psychological states and emotions have great impacts on sleep quality of pregnant women, paying attention to women's psychological states and emotions, especially in the last trimester of pregnancy, seems essential.

AB Chronic exposure to light at night, as in shift work, alters biological clocks (chronodisruption), negatively impacting pregnancy out come in humans. Actually the interaction of maternal and fetal circadian systems could be a key factor determining a fitting health in adults. We propose that chronic photoperiod shift (CPS) during pregnancy alter maternal circadian rhythms and impair circadian physiology in the adult offspring, increasing health risks. Pregnant rats were exposed to normal photoperiod (12 h light, 12 h dark) or to CPS until 85% of gestation. The effects of gestational CPS were evaluated on the mother and adult offspring. In the mother we measured rhythms of heart rate, body temperature, and activity through gestation and daily rhythms of plasma variables (melatonin, corticosterone, aldosterone, and markers of renal function) at 18 days of gestation. In adult offspring, we measured rhythms of the clock gene expression in the supra-chiasmatic nucleus (SCN), locomotor activity, body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, plasma variables, glucose tolerance, and corticosterone response to ACTH. CPS altered all maternal circadian rhythms, lengthened gestation, and increased newborn weight. The adult CPS offspring presented normal rhythms of clock gene expression in the SCN, locomotor activity, and body temperature. However, the daily rhythm of plasma melatonin was absent, and corticosterone, aldosterone, renal markers, blood pressure, and heart rate rhythms were altered. Moreover, CPS offspring presented decreased glucose tolerance and an abnormal corticosterone response to ACTH. Altogether these data show that gestational CPS induced long-term effects on the offspring circadian system, wherein a normal SCN coexists with altered endocrine, cardiovascular, and metabolic function.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of 100 mg/d regular oral intake of aspirin during pregnancy on high-risk pregnancy -induced hypertension syndrome patients.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: We consecutively selected 98 cases high-risk pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome patients. After obtaining the informed consent of the patients, we randomly divided the patients into aspirin group (50 cases) and placebo group (48 cases). The oral intake of aspirin lasted from the final diagnosis of pregnancy to antepartum time, and was taken before sleep. The bleeding index was closely detected and we stop taking aspirin when necessary.
   RESULTS: The comparison of clinical outcome showed that the incidents of pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia of aspirin group were significantly lower than that of the placebo group (p<0.05). Comparing the complications of fetus perinatal period, the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: 100 mg/d regular oral intake of aspirin during pregnancy is safe, effective and worthy of generalization to high-risk pregnancy -induced hypertension syndrome patients.

AB Aim: The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics at enrolment of children and adolescents referred to an obesity programme and to determine how the prevalence of comorbidities differed in Indigenous versus non-Indigenous children.
   Methods: Participants were residents of a semi-rural region of New Zealand (NZ). Eligibility was defined by a body mass index (BMI) of >= 98th percentile or > 91st centile with weight-related comorbidities. Fasting blood, medical and physical assessments were obtained.
   Results: During the recruitment period from January 2012 to August 2014, 239 participants, aged 4.8-16.8 years, undertook assessment. Average BMI standard deviation score was 3.09 (standard deviation (SD) = 0.60, range 1.52-5.34 SD). The majority of participants were of either Maori (NZ's indigenous people (45%)) or NZ European (45%) ethnicity; 29% of participants were from the most deprived quintile of household deprivation. Maori participants were more likely than NZ Europeans to have a mother who smoked during pregnancy (52% vs. 28%, P = 0.001), a family history of type 2 diabetes (66% vs. 53%, P = 0.04), acanthosis nigricans on examination (58% vs. 20%, P < 0.0001), a low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (27% vs. 14%, P = 0.03) or high serum triglyceride (38% vs. 24%, P = 0.03) concentration.
   Conclusion: The unique aspect of this study was the ability to recruit high levels of Maori participants and those from most deprived areas, indicating a high level of acceptability for these target groups. Comorbidities were prevalent in this cohort of overweight/obese school-aged children. While there were some differences in comorbidity prevalence between Maori and NZ Europeans, the overall clinical picture in our cohort, irrespective of ethnicity, was of concern.

AB We know that Husserl knew the text of the Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, which he had at least partly read in Hartenstein's edition of Kant's Sdmtliche Werke. In the section called On the inhibition, weakening, and total los of the sense faculties, Kant poses the problem of death in terms comparable to those of Husserl. Here, I argue that in his analysis of sleep, birth and death in the so-called C-Manuscripts, Husserl makes a transcendental and non-anthropological use of Kant's non transcendental anthropology. If we can say, along with Saulius Geniusas, that the C manuscripts mark the emergence of the problematic of birth, death, and sleep into the critical scope of Husserl's phenomenology of time, then we need to add that the analysis of the sense faculties in the Anthropological Didactic marks the period of gestation.

AB Recent studies have shown associations between maternal obesity at pre-or early pregnancy and long-term neurodevelopment in children, suggesting in utero effects of maternal obesity on offspring brain development. In this study, we examined whether brain functional connectivity to the prefrontal lobe network is different in newborns from normal-weight or obese mothers. Thirty-four full-term healthy infants from uncomplicated pregnancies were included, with 18 born to normal-weight and 16 born to obese mothers. Two weeks after delivery, the infants underwent an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination during natural sleep, which included structural imaging and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scans. Independent component analysis was used to identify the prefrontal lobe network, and dual regression was used to compare functional connectivity between groups. Infants born to normal-weight mothers had higher recruiting (P < 0.05, corrected) of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex regions to the prefrontal network after adjusting for maternal intelligence quotient, gestational weight gain and infant postmenstrual age, gender, birth weight/length, head circumference and neonatal diet. The functional connectivity strength in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with maternal fat mass percentage measured at early pregnancy. This preliminary study indicates that exposure to maternal obesity in utero may be associated with changes in resting-state functional connectivity in the newborn offspring's brain.

AB Objective: To examine the effects of different predictors on the incidence and severity of postpartum depression (PPD) symptoms in a Thai population.
   Methods: In this case control study we delineate the clinical, demographic and socio-economic risk factors associated with PPD symptoms. We used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) 4-6 weeks postpartum to divide parturients into those with (n = 53) and without (n = 260) PPD using a cutoff score of 11.
   Results: This study confirms previous risk factors for PPD (i.e. a history of lifetime major depression and PPD, a history of depression during pregnancy, multi-parity, unwanted pregnancy, childcare stress, premenstrual syndrome, pain symptoms in the early puerperium), and describes new risk factors (i.e. use of caffeine during pregnancy and baby feeding problems). There are significant associations between (a) a lifetime history of major depression and depression during pregnancy, a history of postpartum depression and lifetime mania; and (b) a history of lifetime mania and a history of depression during pregnancy and a history of postpartum depression.
   Conclusions: A history of lifetime major depression and depression during pregnancy are the most important risk factors for postnatal depression, suggesting that sensitization processes increase risk towards postpartum depression. Postpartum depression may be a subtype of unipolar depression or bipolar disorder. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Smoking during pregnancy has long been known as an important risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). However, the precise relationship between the smoking behavior of the mother and SIDS still remains unclear. In this study, the influence of prenatal smoking exposure on the childrens' DNA methylation state of a CpG island located upstream of the promoter of the growth factor independent 1 (GFI1) gene was analyzed.
   Blood samples of well-defined SIDS cases with non-smoking mothers (n = 11), SIDS cases with smoking mothers during pregnancy (n = 11), and non-SIDS cases (n = 6) were obtained from a previous study and methylation states were determined by bisulfite sequencing.
   Significant hypomethylation was observed in this CpG island in SIDS cases with cigarette smoke exposure compared to non-exposed cases. The strongest effect in this CpG island was observed for 49 CpG sites located within a transcription factor binding site. Coding for a transcriptional repressor, GFI1 plays an important role in various developmental processes. Alterations in the GFI1 expression might be linked to various conditions that are known to be associated with SIDS, such as dysregulated hematopoiesis and excessive inflammatory response.
   Data obtained in this study show that analysis of methylation states in cases of sudden infant death syndrome might provide a further important piece of knowledge toward understanding SIDS, and should be investigated in further studies.

AB Circadian clocks influence virtually all physiological processes, including lactation. Here, we investigate the role of the CLOCK gene in regulation of mammary epithelial cell growth and differentiation. Comparison of mammary morphology in late-pregnant wild-type and Clock Delta 19 mice, showed that gland development was negatively impacted by genetic loss of a functional timing system. To understand whether these effects were due, in part, to loss of CLOCK function in the gland, the mouse mammary epithelial cell line, HC11, was transfected with short hairpin RNA that targeted Clock (shClock). Cells transfected with shClock expressed 70% less Clock mRNA than wild-type (WT) HC11 cultures, which resulted in significantly depressed levels of CLOCK protein (P < 0.05). HC11 lines carrying shClock had four-fold higher growth rates (P < 0.05), and the percentage of cells in G1 phase was significantly higher (90.1 +/- 1.1% of shClock vs. 71.3 +/- 3.6% of WT-HC11) following serum starvation. Quantitative-PCR (qPCR) analysis showed shClock had significant effects (P < 0.0001) on relative expression levels of Ccnd1, Wee1, and Tp63. qPCR analysis of the effect of shClock on Fasn and Cdh1 expression in undifferentiated cultures and cultures treated 96 h with dexamethasone, insulin, and prolactin (differentiated) found levels were reduced by twofold and threefold, respectively (P < 0.05), in shClock line relative to WT cultures. Abundance of CDH1 and TP63 proteins were significantly reduced in cultures transfected with shClock. These data support how CLOCK plays a role in regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation in the mammary gland.

AB Introduction: Few physical activity interventions have been undertaken in infants and toddlers, despite concerns that they are insufficiently active. The Prevention of Overweight in Infancy trial encouraged parents to be physically active with their child from birth, including prone-based play ("tummy time"), while reducing time spent restrained in car seats and "strollers." Methods: A total of 802 women, recruited in late pregnancy, were randomized to a physical activity intervention, which provided information antenatally, and active group sessions with their infant at 3, 9, and 18 months of age. Questionnaires were completed at multiple time points, and toddlers wore Actical accelerometers for 5 d at 24 months of age. Results: Attendance at intervention sessions was high in infancy but declined by 18 months to 66%. Almost all parents placed their infant prone to play at least once a day (90%-95%, overall median 25 min.d(-1)), with no intervention differences observed (P = 0.445 and P = 0.350 at 4 and 6 months, respectively). Few differences were observed in other measures of restraint or parental activity at any time point. At 2 yr, children spent approximately 8 h.d(-1) in sedentary time while awake and 3.6 h in light-to-vigorous activity. However, no group differences were apparent in counts per minute (P = 0.759) or time in light-to-vigorous activity (P = 0.960). Conclusion: An early life intervention targeting improvements in child and parent physical activity as part of a wider obesity prevention initiative had little effect on physical activity at 2 yr of age.

AB This study aimed to examine if there is a difference in the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sleepiness between pregnant and non-pregnant women. It also aimed to evaluate if obstetric outcomes were associated to sleep-disordered breathing among the pregnant women.
   One hundred pregnant women (gestational weeks 24-34) and 80 age- and body mass index-matched non-pregnant women underwent whole-night respiratory recordings (airflow, snoring, respiratory movements, body position, pulse oximetry). The women also answered a questionnaire including the Epworth sleepiness scale.
   Eighty-nine percent of the pregnant women had normal body mass index (BMI). Objectively, recorded snoring was more common among the pregnant women (median 9 % of total estimated sleep time) than among the controls (4 % of total sleep time, p = 0.005). Three of the pregnant women had OSA (apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) > 5), but in two cases, this was mainly due to central hypopneas. None had AHI > 10. Two controls were diagnosed as OSA. Respiratory parameters including snoring showed no impact on obstetric outcomes. Total Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) score was higher among pregnant women than among controls (median 9 vs 7, p < 0.001). There was no difference concerning the separate items. There were no significant associations between either subjectively reported or objectively recorded snoring and ESS scores.
   There was no increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea among pregnant women. One reason for this could be that the majority of the women in this study were non-obese. Neither OSA nor snoring was likely an explanation for the increased daytime sleepiness seen in the pregnant women.

AB Narcolepsy is a chronic primary sleep disorder, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep dysfunction with or without cataplexy. Narcolepsy is uncommon, with a low prevalence rate which makes it difficult to diagnose definitively without a complex series of tests and a detailed history. The aim of this study was to review patients referred to a tertiary sleep centre who had been labelled with a diagnosis of narcolepsy prior to referral in order to assess if the diagnosis was accurate, and if not, to determine the cause of diagnostic misattribution.
   All patients seen at a sleep centre from 2007-2013 (n = 551) who underwent detailed objective testing including an MSLT PSG, as well as wearing an actigraphy watch and completing a sleep diary for 2 weeks, were assessed for a pre-referral and final diagnosis of narcolepsy.
   Of the 41 directly referred patients with a diagnostic label of narcolepsy, 19 (46 %) were subsequently confirmed to have narcolepsy on objective testing and assessment by a sleep physician using ICSD-2 criteria.
   The diagnosis of narcolepsy was incorrectly attributed to almost 50 % of patients labelled with a diagnosis of narcolepsy who were referred for further opinion by a variety of specialists and generalists. Accurate diagnosis of narcolepsy is critical for many reasons, such as the impact it has on quality of life, driving, employment, insurance and pregnancy in women as well as medication management.

AB We evaluated the psychometric properties of a Mandarin Chinese version of the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire-10 (FOSQ-10) in pregnant women. A total of 228 first-trimester pregnant women participated in the study, which was conducted in an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. The Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=.85), adequate corrected item-total correlations (from .40 to .67), and acceptable test-retest reliability over 7 days (ICC=.73). Construct validity was supported by exploratory factor analysis showing a one-factor structure with item loadings between .49 and .77. Significant associations with the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey 12 version 2 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index supported criterion-related and convergent validity. Significant differences in the Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 total scores were found between women with clinically significant daytime sleepiness and those without, suggesting adequate discriminant validity. Ceiling effects were observed for all items, but no floor or ceiling effects were found for total scores. Findings suggest that the Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 is a valid and reliable instrument to identify important effects of sleep-related impairment in Chinese women during pregnancy. Further testing is needed in more diverse pregnant women, such as women with complicated pregnancies and those with sleep disorders. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The last few years have witnessed a number of publications linking sleep disordered breathing to adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in various populations. Associations with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and growth restriction have been consistent across many studies. Though the manuscripts reviewed here consist mostly of preliminary data and need further confirmation, the studies have highlighted new directions in the assessment of the impact of sleep disordered breathing and pregnancy, and paved the way for new fields of research in this area.

AB Background: Pregnancy-related dreams are often found in pregnant women but also the number of negatively toned dreams seems to be increased in this challenging phase of a woman's life.
   Methods: Nightmare frequency and subjectively experienced stress was elicited via questionnaires. The mothers-to-be were approached during their application visit about 4-8 weeks prior to delivery in three obstetric hospitals. The present analysis included 406 women aged 16-40 years in the last trimester of their pregnancy. Women with severe somatic illnesses and/or psychiatric disorders were excluded. The representative sample included 496 women (age range: 14-93 years.).
   Results: The findings clearly indicate that pregnant women report nightmares more often compared to a representative sample and that nightmare frequency is closely related to subjectively experienced stress during daytime. Moreover, baby-related dreams were correlated with nightmare frequency but not with day-time stress.
   Conclusions: Future studies should investigate the prevalence of nightmare disorders in pregnancy and study whether brief interventions like Imagery Rehearsal Therapy are beneficial for pregnant women suffering from nightmares.

AB Background: Depression during pregnancy is a common and high impact disease. Generally, 5-10 % of pregnant women suffer from depression. Children who have been exposed to maternal depression during pregnancy have a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes and more often show cognitive, emotional and behavioural problems. Therefore, early detection and treatment of antepartum depression is necessary. Both psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, first choice treatments in a non-pregnant population, have limitations in treating depression during pregnancy. Therefore, it is urgent and relevant to investigate alternative treatments for antepartum depression. Bright light therapy (BLT) is a promising treatment for pregnant women with depressive disorder, for it combines direct availability, sufficient efficacy, low costs and high safety, taking the safety for the unborn child into account as well.
   Methods: In this study, 150 pregnant women (12-18 weeks pregnant) with a DSM-V diagnosis of depressive disorder will be randomly allocated in a 1: 1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms: treatment with BLT (9.000 lux) or treatment with dim red light therapy (100 lux). Both groups will be treated for 6 weeks at home on a daily basis for 30 min, within 30 min of habitual wake-up time. Follow-up will take place after 6 weeks of therapy, 3 and 10 weeks after end of therapy, at birth and 2, 6 and 18 months postpartum. Primary outcome will be the average change in depressive symptoms between the two groups, as measured by the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale - Seasonal Affective Disorder version and the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale. Changes in rating scale scores of these questionnaires over time will be analysed using generalized linear mixed models. Secondary outcomes will be the changes in maternal cortisol and melatonin levels, in maternal sleep quality and gestational age, birth weight, infant behaviour, infant cortisol exposure and infant cortisol stress response.
   Discussion: If BLT reduces depressive symptoms in pregnant women, it will provide a safe, cheap, non-pharmacological and efficacious alternative treatment for psychotherapy and antidepressant medication in treating antepartum depression, without any expected adverse reactions for the unborn child.

AB Background: Approximately 25 % of pregnant women suffer from a high level of Fear of Childbirth (FoC), as assessed by the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire (W-DEQ-A, score >= 66). FoC negatively affects pregnant women's mental health and adaptation to the perinatal period. Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) seems to be potentially effective in decreasing pregnancy-related anxiety and stress. We propose a theoretical model of Avoidance and Participation in Pregnancy, Birth and the Postpartum Period in order to explore FoC and to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of change of MBCP.
   Methods/Design: The 'I've Changed My Mind' study is a quasi-experimental controlled trial among 128 pregnant women (week 16-26) with a high level of FoC, and their partners. Women will be allocated to MBCP (intervention group) or to Fear of Childbirth Consultation (FoCC; comparison group). Primary outcomes are FoC, labour pain, and willingness to accept obstetrical interventions. Secondary outcomes are anxiety, depression, general stress, parental stress, quality of life, sleep quality, fatigue, satisfaction with childbirth, birth outcome, breastfeeding self-efficacy and cost-effectiveness. The total study duration for women is six months with four assessment waves: pre-and post-intervention, following the birth and closing the maternity leave period.
   Discussion: Given the high prevalence and severe negative impact of FoC this study can be of major importance if statistically and clinically meaningful benefits are found. Among the strengths of this study are the clinical-based experimental design, the extensive cognitive-emotional and behavioural measurements in pregnant women and their partners during the entire perinatal period, and the representativeness of study sample as well as generalizability of the study's results. The complex and innovative measurements of FoC in this study are an important strength in clinical research on FoC not only in pregnant women but also in their partners.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the independent associations between nausea, vomiting, fatigue and health-related quality of life of women in early pregnancy in the Generation R study, which is a prospective mother and child cohort. Analyses were based on 5079 women in early pregnancy in the Rotterdam area, the Netherlands. The information on nausea, vomiting and fatigue in the previous three months was measured in the questionnaire at enrollment, as well as potential confounders (i.e., maternal/gestational age, ethnic background, educational level, parity, marital status, body mass index, tobacco and alcohol use, chronic/infectious conditions, uro-genital conditions/symptoms, sleep quality, headache, anxiety, and depression). Health-related quality of life was assessed by the 12-item Short Form Health Survey and physical and mental component summary scores were calculated. Multivariate regression models were performed to evaluate the independent associations of the presence of nausea, vomiting and fatigue with health-related quality of life, adjusting for potential confounders. 33.6% of women experienced daily presence of nausea, 9.6% for vomiting and 44.4% for fatigue. Comparing with women who never reported nausea, vomiting and fatigue, women with daily presence of at least one of these symptoms had significantly lower scores of physical component summary and mental component summary, after adjusting for potential confounders. Our study shows how common nausea, vomiting and fatigue are among women in early pregnancy and how much each of these symptoms negatively impact on health-related quality of life. We call for awareness of this issue from health care professionals, pregnant women and their families.

AB Background: Perinatal depression (PND) has an overall estimated prevalence of roughly 12 %. Untreated PND has significant negative consequences not only on the health of the mothers, but also on the physical, emotional and cognitive development of their children. No certain risk factors are known to predict PND and no completely safe drug treatments are available during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Sleep and depression are strongly related to each other because of a solid reciprocal causal relationship. Bright light therapy (BLT) is a well-tested and safe treatment, effective in both depression and circadian/sleep disorders.
   Methods: In a 3-year longitudinal, observational, multicentre study, about 500 women will be recruited and followed-up from early pregnancy (10-15 gestational week) until 12 months after delivery. The primary aim of the present study is to systematically explore and characterize risk factors for PND by prospective sleep assessment (using wrist actigraphy, polysomnography and various sleep questionnaires) and bloodbased analysis of potential markers during the perinatal period (Life-ON study). Secondary aims are to explore the relationship between specific genetic polymorphisms and PND (substudy Life-ON1), to investigate the effectiveness of BLT in treating PND (substudy Life-ON2) and to test whether a short term trial of BLT during pregnancy can prevent PND (substudy Life-ON3).
   Discussion: The characterization of specific predictive and risk factors for PND may substantially contribute to improve preventive medical and social strategies for the affected women. The study results are expected to promote a better understanding of the relationship between sleep disorders and the development of PND and to confirm, in a large sample of women, the safety and efficacy of BLT both in prevention and treatment of PND.

AB Obesity is currently recognized as a health epidemic worldwide. Its prevalence has doubled in the last three decades. Obesity is a complex clinical picture associated with physical, physiologic, hormonal, genetic, cultural, socioeconomic and environmental factors. The rate of obesity is also increasing in the pregnant women population. Maternal obesity is associated with less than optimal obstetrical, fetal and neonatal outcomes. It is also associated with significant adverse long-term effects on both obese parturients and the infants born from obese women. A number of guidelines have been published to educate health care workers and the general population in an attempt to develop effective interventions on a large scale to prevent obesity. These guidelines are multiple, confusing and inconsistent. There are no standard recommendations regarding gestational weight gaining goals, nutrients and additional elements necessary for certain obese women who have been treated with bariatric surgical procedures, screening for metabolic diseases such as diabetes, additional preventive health care services indicated for obese women in the pregnancy planning stages, during prenatal care, in the immediate post-partum period and as a long-term approach for health preservation. In 2013, the American Medical Association supported by several US national medical specialty organizations published Resolution 420 (A-13) recognizing obesity as a disease state with multiple pathophysiological aspects requiring a range of interventions to improve its prevention and treatment. The goal of this decision was to encourage a broader spectrum of health care benefits insurance coverage for the prevention and treatment of obesity. There are a number of myths and misconceptions associated with obesity. These perspectives present our views and clinical experience with a partial review of recent bibliography addressing the associations between obese reproductive age women and their risks during pregnancy.

AB Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by total or partial interruptions of airflow during sleep, despite ongoing efforts to breathe. These pauses result from repeated upper airway obstructions that generate a systemic inflammatory condition with consequences for the endothelial function that increase the risk of cardiometabolic events. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy is greater than that observed in the general population and increases in the third trimester. Although limited, the information currently available supports the notion that obstructive sleep apnea is an independent, and potentially modifiable, risk factor for maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Experimental and prospective studies in humans have demonstrated an association between obstructive sleep apnea and low birth weight. Endothelial dysfunction may be the link that underlies the association of obstructive sleep apnea with high perinatal risk. The information reviewed herein suggests that treating obstructive sleep apnea with positive-pressure devices could be an effective strategy for decreasing perinatal morbidity and mortality.

AB BACKGROUND: Long continuous periods of working contribute to fatigue, which is an established risk factor for adverse patient outcomes in many clinical specialties. The total number of hours worked by delivering clinicians before delivery therefore may be an important predictor of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.
   OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine how rates of adverse delivery outcomes vary with the number of hours worked by the delivering clinician before delivery during both day and night shifts.
   STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 24,506 unscheduled deliveries at an obstetrics center in the United Kingdom from 2008-2013. We compared adverse outcomes between day shifts and night shifts using random-effects logistic regression to account for interoperator variability. Adverse outcomes were estimated blood loss of >= 1.5 L, arterial cord pH of <= 7.1, failed instrumental delivery, delayed neonatal respiration, severe perineal trauma, and any critical incident. Additive dynamic regression was used to examine the association between hours worked before delivery (up to 12 hours) and risk of adverse outcomes. Models were controlled for maternal age, maternal body mass index, parity, birthweight, gestation, obstetrician experience, and delivery type.
   RESULTS: We found no difference in the risk of any adverse outcome that was studied between day vs night shifts. Yet, risk of estimated blood loss of >= 1.5 L and arterial cord pH of <= 7.1 both varied by 30-40% within 12-hour shifts (P<. 05). The highest risk of adverse outcomes occurred after 9-10 hours from the beginning of the shift for both day and night shifts. The risk of other adverse outcomes did not vary significantly by hours worked or by day vs night shift.
   CONCLUSION: Number of hours already worked before undertaking unscheduled deliveries significantly influences the risk of certain adverse outcomes. Our findings suggest that fatigue may play a role in increasing the risk of adverse delivery outcomes later in shifts and that obstetric work patterns could be better designed to minimize the risk of adverse delivery outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a home-based cognitive-behavioral training program for sleep during late pregnancy.
   METHODS: A nonrandomized quasiexperimental sample of nulliparous women who received the intervention during pregnancy (n=25) was compared with two control groups (n=76 and n=48) from other intervention studies at similar postintervention time points: approximately 1 month before childbirth and 1-2 months after childbirth. The home-based Sleep Enhancement Training System for Pregnancy consisted of 4 weeks of sound-enhanced audio relaxation programs, readings, and daily sleep diaries. Both control groups received dietary recommendations for improving sleep. Sleep duration (total sleep time) and sleep disruption (wake after sleep onset) were measured using wrist actigraphy for a minimum of 48 hours on consecutive weekdays.
   RESULTS: The intervention group had significantly longer sleep duration and less sleep disruption than both control groups, particularly at the postpartum assessment. Intervention participants slept an average of 430 (95% confidence interval [CI] 397-464) minutes during pregnancy compared with 420 (95% CI 403-438) and 417 (95% CI 395-439) minutes for the two control groups. At the postpartum assessment, the intervention group slept 446 (95% CI 415-478) minutes compared with 390 (95% CI 373-408) and 370 (95% CI 348-393) minutes for those in the control groups. In terms of sleep disruption, women in the intervention group had 16.1% (95% CI 11.9-20.2%) wake after sleep onset during pregnancy, whereas women in the control groups had 13.4% (95% CI 11.2-15.5%) and 20.4% (95% CI 17.7-23.0%). Postpartum, the intervention group had 20.3% (95% CI 16.4-24.1%) wake after sleep onset compared with 26.6% (95% CI 24.5-28.8%) and 28.7% (95% CI 26.0-31.5%) among women in the control groups. Participant feedback about the intervention was generally positive, although intervention adherence was variable.
   CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of the feasibility and efficacy of the Sleep Enhancement Training System for Pregnancy intervention for enhancing sleep that typically worsens during late pregnancy and after childbirth.

AB Night waking in preschoolers has been associated with adverse health outcomes in cross-sectional studies, but has rarely been analyzed in a longitudinal setting. Therefore, little is known about the evolution of night waking in early childhood. The objectives of the present study were: to identify night-waking trajectories in preschoolers, and to examine the risk factors associated with those trajectories. Analyses were based on the French birth-cohort study EDEN, which recruited 2002 pregnant women between 2003 and 2006. Data on a child's night waking at the ages of two, three, and five, six years, and potential confounders, were collected through parental self-reported questionnaires. Night-waking trajectories were computerized using group-based trajectory modeling on 1346 children. Two distinct developmental patterns were identified: the "2-5 rare night-waking" (77% of the children) and the "2-5 common night-waking" pattern. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the factors associated with the trajectories. Risk factors for belonging to the "2-5 common night-waking" trajectory were: exposure to passive smoking at home, daycare in a collective setting, watching television for extended periods, bottle feeding at night, high emotionality, and low shyness. This approach allowed identification of risk factors associated with night waking during a critical age window, and laid the groundwork for identifying children at higher risk of deleterious sleep patterns. Those risk factors were mainly living habits, which indicated that prevention and intervention programs could be highly beneficial in this population. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB While the diagnosis of migraine in children is generally straightforward, treatment can seem complex with a number of medication choices, many of which are used "off label." Patients with intermittent migraines can often be managed with ibuprofen or naproxen taken as needed. Unfortunately, by the time that children present to our practice, they have often tried these medications without improvement. Triptans are frequently prescribed to these patients with good success. It is important to make the patient aware of the possible associated serotonergic reactions. If the patient is having more than one headache per week or the headaches are prolonged, prophylactic treatment is indicated. In our practice, the overwhelming majority of these patients will be treated with amitriptyline or topiramate. We generally allow side effect tolerability to guide our choice of medication. Cyproheptadine is often used in younger patients as it comes in a liquid form. There is evidence supporting the use of propranolol, though the potential worsening of underlying asthma symptoms may limit its use, and sodium valproate, which must be used with caution in female patients of childbearing age due to significant teratogenicity risks. Other prophylactic treatments with less robust evidence include the antiepileptic drugs gabapentin, zonisamide, and levetiracetam; calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and amlodipine; and the angiotensin receptor blocking agent candasartin (not available in the USA). Almost all patients in our practice are advised to take magnesium supplementation. Magnesium is a supplement with relatively few adverse effects and good evidence for improvement of migraine symptoms. We evaluate lifestyle issues and comorbidities in all our patients. Ignoring these will make successful treatment near impossible. Good sleep, adequate hydration, appropriate diet, and exercise are vitally important. Finally, most of our patients benefit from a psychology evaluation with cognitive behavioral therapy. Stress management and biofeedback are tremendously helpful in improving quality of life in migraineurs.

AB AimsA longitudinal birth cohort provides an opportunity to study the impact of childhood conditions persisting into adulthood. This study examines the cross-sectional association of asthma with sleep quality and snoring in the adolescent and young adult population and the extent to which asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years independently predict themselves or each other at 21 years.
   MethodsData from a 21-year follow-up of mothers and their children recruited into the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (n = 7223). Complete asthma and sleep information (questionnaire data) was available for 5015 participants at 14 years and 3527 at 21 years, with 3237 participants at both 14 and 21 years.
   ResultsPoor sleep quality and snoring were independently associated with asthma at 14 years and 21 years, with stronger associations evident in women. At 21 years, associations were mediated by asthma symptom severity. Asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years each strongly and independently predicted themselves at 21 years. Asthma at 14 years predicted snoring at 21 years, while poor sleep quality and snoring in women predicted asthma at 21 years, the latter partially mediated by body mass index.
   ConclusionsThe relationship between asthma, sleep quality and snoring varied by gender. Sleep quality and snoring should be considered in the assessment and holistic management of asthma. The predictive relationship seen between 14 and 21 years provides an opportunity to address these issues at a younger age.

AB Aims/hypothesis The aim of this study was to examine the association between maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and childhood obesity at age 9-11 years in 12 countries around the world.
   Methods A multinational cross-sectional study of 4740 children aged 9-11 years was conducted. Maternal GDM was diagnosed according to the ADA or WHO criteria. Height and waist circumference were measured using standardised methods. Weight and body fat were measured using a portable Tanita SC-240 Body Composition Analyzer. Multilevel modelling was used to account for the nested nature of the data.
   Results The prevalence of reported maternal GDM was 4.3%. The overall prevalence of childhood obesity, central obesity and high body fat were 12.3%, 9.9% and 8.1%, respectively. The multivariable-adjusted (maternal age at delivery, education, infant feeding mode, gestational age, number of younger siblings, child unhealthy diet pattern scores, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, sleeping time, sedentary time, sex and birthweight) odds ratios among children of GDM mothers compared with children of non-GDM mothers were 1.53 (95% CI 1.03, 2.27) for obesity, 1.73 (95% CI 1.14, 2.62) for central obesity and 1.42 (95% CI 0.90, 2.26) for high body fat. The positive association was still statistically significant for central obesity after additional adjustment for current maternal BMI but was no longer significant for obesity and high body fat.
   Conclusions/interpretation Maternal GDM was associated with increased odds of childhood obesity at 9-11 years old but this association was not fully independent of maternal BMI.

AB Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is linked with several acute maternal health risks and long-term development of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Intrauterine exposure to GDM similarly increases offspring risk of early-life health complications and later disease. GDM recurrence is common, affecting 40 to 73% of women, and augments associated maternal/fetal/child health risks. Modifiable and independent risk factors for GDM include maternal excessive gestational weight gain and prepregnancy overweight and obesity. Lifestyle interventions that target diet, activity, and behavioral strategies can effectively modify body weight. Randomized clinical trials testing the effects of lifestyle interventions during pregnancy to reduce excessive gestational weight gain have generally shown mixed effects on reducing GDM incidence. Trials testing the effects of postpartum lifestyle interventions among women with a history of GDM have shown reduced incidence of diabetes and improved cardiovascular disease risk factors. However, the long-term effects of interpregnancy or prepregnancy lifestyle interventions on subsequent GDM remain unknown. Future adequately powered and well-controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the effects of lifestyle interventions to prevent GDM and identify pathways to effectively reach reproductive-aged women across all levels of society, before, during, and after pregnancy.

AB Disruption of the maternal environment during pregnancy leads to behavioral changes and diseases in the adult offspring. To explore the influence of prenatal continuous light exposure (PCLE) on the adult offspring, we exposed pregnant Wistar rats to constant light during late gestation. Adult PCLE offspring showed an anxiety-like behavior and impairment of short-term memory in different tests. Measurements in the whole brain homogenates from newborn and adult offspring indicated decreased melatonin and serotonin levels and increased reactive oxygen species level in PCLE offspring. Further, we determined melatonin-, serotonin-, oxidative stress-, apoptosis-, and circadian system-related genes expression in different brain areas of adult offspring. The serotonin reuptaker Slc6a4 displayed a decreased expression in the prefrontal cortex of PCLE group. The circadian rhythm-related gene Rora was upregulated in the amygdala of PCLE offspring. Our results point to adverse behavioral effects of PCLE on adult offspring, involving serotonin and melatonin signaling dysregulation, increased chronic oxidative stress, and altered gene expression.

AB Animal studies demonstrate that circadian rhythm disruption during pregnancy can be deleterious to reproductive capacity and the long-term health of the progeny. Our previous studies in rats have shown that exposure of pregnant dams to an environment that significantly disrupts maternal circadian rhythms programs increased adiposity and poor glucose metabolism in offspring. In this study, we used mice with a Clock Delta 19 mutation to determine whether foetal development within a genetically disrupted circadian environment affects pregnancy outcomes and alters the metabolic health of offspring. Ten female Clock Delta 19+MEL mutant mice were mated with 10 wildtype males, and 10 wildtype females were mated with 10 Clock Delta 19+MEL mutant males. While genetically identical, the heterozygote foetuses were exposed to either a normal (wildtype dams) or disrupted (Clock Delta 19+MEL mutant dams) circadian environment during gestation. Pregnancy outcomes including time to mate, gestation length, litter size and birth weight were assessed. One male and one female offspring from each litter were assessed for postnatal growth, body composition, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test at 3 and 12 months of age. There was no effect of maternal genotype on pregnancy outcomes, with days to plug, gestation length, litter size and perinatal mortality not significantly different between wildtype and Clock Delta 19+MEL mutant dams. Similarly, there was no effect of maternal genotype on weight of the offspring at birth or at any stage of postnatal growth. While there was an effect of sex on various tissue weights at 3 and 12 months of age, there were minimal effects of maternal genotype. Relative adrenal weight was significantly reduced (-32%) in offspring from Clock Delta 19+MEL mutant dams, whereas gastrocnemius muscle was significantly increased (+16%) at 3 months of age only. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests at 3 months of age revealed female offspring from Clock Delta 19+MEL mutant dams had significantly reduced area under the curve following glucose administration (-25%), although no differences were found at 12 months of age. There was no effect of maternal genotype on intraperitoneal insulin tolerance at 3 or 12 months of age for either sex. These results demonstrate that foetal growth within a genetically disrupted circadian environment during gestation has no effect on pregnancy success, and only marginal impacts upon the long-term metabolic health of offspring. These results do not support the hypothesis that circadian rhythm disruption during pregnancy programs poor metabolic homeostasis in offspring. However, when maintained on a 12L:12D photoperiod, the Clock Delta 19+MEL mutant dams display relatively normal patterns of activity and melatonin secretion, which may have reduced the impact of the mutation upon foetal metabolic programming.

AB Sleep problems are one of the most important issues of public health. Poor sleep quality in this period of pregnancy common problem that can have harmful effects on the health of the fetus and the mother. This study aimed to determine the sleep quality and its predictive factors in nulliparous pregnant women was conducted in Hamadan city, Iran. This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted on 309 pregnant women, which were admitted to health centers in Hamadan city, Iran, 2016. They were allocated into case group (undesirable Sleep Quality, PSQI score of >5, n=165) and the control group (desirable Sleep Quality, PSQI score of <= 5, n=144). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Data obtained using demographic, obstetric and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which were collected by census method. Analyzing the data was performed by SPSS/20, using Pearson correlation test, t-test, chi-square and multiple linear regression were analyzed. P-value<0.05 was regarded as significant. The results showed that 165 patients (53.4 percent) of the participants had poor sleep quality. Two groups in terms of age, jab, body mass index, pre-pregnancy surveillance, spouse's job, monthly income and regular prenatal care showed no significant difference (P>0.05). Between quality of sleep and gestational age, maternal education and the consent of the wife and husband's education were significant negative correlation (P<0.05). Considering the high prevalence of sleep disorders and the importance of this issue in the mental health of pregnant women should be given to improve the quality of sleep.

AB Studies suggested the presence of foetal adrenal rhythms of cortisol, which are entrained in antiphase to maternal rhythms. In contrast, neonates are thought to have no adrenal rhythm until 2-3 months after birth. To test the hypothesis that a foetal-type adrenal rhythm is preserved after birth, saliva samples were collected from 65 preterm/term infants during hospital stay (30-40 weeks corrected age) at 10: 00 and 19: 00 h. Cortisol levels were assessed for their diurnal difference and dependence on antenatal/postnatal clinical variables. Cortisol levels were lower during periods 15-28 days and >28 days than <= 5 days of life. Lower cortisol was associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), gestational age <28 weeks, and mechanical ventilation after birth. Higher cortisol was associated with vaginal delivery and non-invasive ventilation support at saliva collection. PIH and non-invasive mechanical ventilation at saliva collection were associated with cortisol levels even after adjustment for postnatal age. Cortisol levels were higher in the evening than in the morning, which was unassociated with gestational and postnatal age. Higher cortisol levels in the evening suggest the preservation of a foetal-type diurnal rhythm. Cortisol levels are associated with intrinsic and extrinsic variables, such as PIH, delivery mode, gestational age, and respiratory conditions.

AB Here, we showed that the Clock gene was important for reproductive performance in mice. We compared outcomes from the four possible mating combinations between wild-type mice (WT) and mice homozygous for the Clock delta-19 mutation (CL). We found that the only significant differences were between the WT male x WT female and CL male x CL female mating groups; these groups differed with regard to elongation of the pregnancy period (19.3 vs. 20.5 days, respectively, P < 0.05) and the number of newborn pups (13.4 +/- 0.8 vs. 8.6 +/- 1.5, respectively, P < 0.05). Because CL dams impregnated by male CLs exhibited normal continuous increases in body weight during the entire gestation period and did not show any signs of spontaneous abortion from mid to late gestation, we reasoned that some embryos were lost before or at the time of implantation. Immediately before implantation (88 hours after fertilization), neither the number of embryos collected from uteri nor the percentage of the embryos that reached the blastocyst stage differed significantly among mating groups. In contrast, immediately after implantation (160 hours after fertilization), the average number of implantation sites was significantly lower for the CL male x CL female mating group than that for the WT male' x WT female mating group (7.0 vs.13.0, P < 0.05); this decrease was accompanied by a significant lowering of the positions of implantation sites in uteri, and this lowering of the implantation sites was more severe when mothers and embryos bore more CL alleles (WT male x WT female > CL male x WT female > WT male x CL female > CL male x CL female), suggesting that the Clock mutation reduced the reproduction performance of the parents by affecting the implantation capacity via such as embryos' ability to implant.

   OUTCOMES
AB Background: Clinically significant psychological distress in pregnancy is common, with epidemiological research suggesting that between 15 and 25 % of pregnant women experience elevated symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Untreated psychological distress in pregnancy is associated with poor obstetrical outcomes, changes in maternal physiology, elevated incidence of child physical and psychological disorders, and is predictive of maternal postpartum mood disorders. Despite the wide-ranging impact of antenatal psychological distress on mothers and their children, there is a gap in our knowledge about the most effective treatments that are available for psychological distress experienced in pregnancy. Additionally, no trials have focused on potential physiological changes that may occur as a result of receiving mindfulness training in pregnancy. The proposed trial will determine the effectiveness of an 8-week modified Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) intervention delivered during pregnancy.
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of MBCT to treat psychological distress in pregnancy. A sample of 60 consenting pregnant women aged 18 years and above will be enrolled and randomized to the experimental (MBCT) or control (treatment as usual) condition. Primary (e.g., symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety), secondary (cortisol, blood pressure (BP), heart rate variability (HRV), and sleep) and other outcome data (e.g., psychological diagnoses) will be collected via a combination of laboratory visits and at-home assessments from both groups at baseline (T-1), immediately following the intervention (T-2), and at 3 months postpartum (T-3). Descriptive statistics will be used to describe sample characteristics. Data will be analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. Hierarchical linear models will be used to test intervention effects on primary and secondary outcomes.
   Discussion: The trial is expected to improve knowledge about evidence-based treatments for psychological distress experienced in pregnancy and to evaluate the potential impact of mindfulness-based interventions on maternal physiology.

AB Background: For many countries where malaria is endemic, the burden of malaria is high in border regions. In ethnic minority areas along the Myanmar-China border, residents have poor access to medical care for diagnosis and treatment, and there have been many malaria outbreaks in such areas. Since 2007, with the support of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), a malaria control project was introduced to reduce the malaria burden in several ethnic minority regions.
   Methods: A malaria control network was established during the period from 2007 to 2014. Multiple malaria interventions, including diagnosis, treatment, distribution of LLINs and health education, were conducted to improve the accessibility and quality of malaria control services for local residents. Annual cross-sectional surveys were conducted to evaluate intervention coverage and indicators of malaria transmission.
   Results: In ethnic minority regions where a malaria control network was established, both the annual malaria incidence (19.1 per thousand per year, in 2009; 8.7, in 2014) and malaria prevalence (13.6 % in 2008; 0.43 % in 2014) decreased dramatically during the past 5-6 years. A total of 851 393 febrile patients were detected, 202 598 malaria cases (including confirmed cases and suspected cases) were treated, and 759 574 LLINs were delivered to populations at risk. Of households in 2012, 73.9 % had at least one ITNs/LLINs (vs. 28.3 %, in 2008), and 50.7 % of children less than 5 years and 50.3 % of pregnant women slept under LLINs the night prior to their visit. Additionally, malaria knowledge was improved in 68.4 % of residents.
   Conclusion: There has been great success in improving malaria control in these regions from 2007 to 2014. Malaria burdens have decreased, especially in KOK and WA. The continued maintenance of sustainable malaria control networks in these regions may be a long-term process, due to regional conflicts and the lack of funds, technology, and health workers. Furthermore, information and scientific support from the international community should be offered to these ethnic minority regions to uphold recent achievements.

DE Obesity; reproduction; infertility; body weight
ID BODY-MASS INDEX; SPERM DNA INTEGRITY; METAANALYSIS; ASSOCIATION;
   OUTCOMES
AB Obesity is associated with multiple interrelated disorders such as insulin resistance/diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea - all contributing collectively to the diagnosis of a metabolic syndrome, that reduces life expectancy (Flegal et al., 2013). Metabolic changes in obesity may also affect reproduction.
   In women, obesity is associated with a higher incidence of ovulatory disorders and idiopathic infertility (ASRM, 2015). On the other hand, obese women under treatment for infertility may face additional problems, such as the need for higher doses of drugs to induce/stimulate ovulation, oocyte morphological changes, reduction in fertilization and implantation rates, and embryo quality (ASRM, 2015; Provost et al., 2016). Compared to women of normal body weight, obese women submitted to IVF may present reduced rates of clinical pregnancy and live births, with an increased rate of abortion ( Provost et al., 2016). In addition, obese pregnant women have a higher incidence of maternal and fetal complications, such as gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and increased perinatal morbidity/mortality (Aune et al., 2014).
   With respect to men, male obesity has been linked to reduced rates of pregnancy and live births (Campbell et al., 2015). However, studies on specific relationships between semen parameters and obesity have been contradictory. Although different studies have shown correlations between increased obesity and changes in sperm parameters, although selectively (MacDonald et al., 2010, Sermondade et al., 2013, Campbell et al., 2015), others did not report adverse effects (Bandel et al., 2015). On the other hand, recent studies point to a negative association between body weight and the very integrity of sperm DNA (Fariello et al., 2012; Taha et al., 2016); however, these results are not unanimous ( Bandel et al., 2015; Campbell et al., 2015). Spermatogenesis requires a controlled testicular environment and intact endocrine signaling through the hypothalamic- pituitary-testicle axis; and the impact of obesity on fertility can be attributed mainly to the endocrine mechanisms that alter this relationship (MacDonald et al., 2010; Fariello et al. 2012; ASRM, 2015). Moreover, the preferential buildup of toxic substances and fat-soluble endocrine disruptors in adipose tissue, and hyperthermia resulting from the buildup of adipose tissue around the scrotum cause oxidative stress to the testes, thus broadening these alterations ( Fariello et al., 2012; Sermondade et al., 2013, Taha et al., 2016).
   In conclusion, even considering the controversies, weighty reduction and lifestyle interventions should be included in the recommendations to obese infertile couples.

AB Objective: To find which anesthesia type is better in managing stress and sleep quality of laboring mothers in Korea.
   Methodology: We surveyed pregnant women who were healthy, their first labor, under the age of 34, and delivering by elective cesarean section about their stress scale and sleep quality before the operation and 10 days after the operation. Sleep quality and stress scale were assessed by using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Fifty patients for elective cesarean section were divided into two groups; 25 patients had general anesthesia (group G) and 25 patients had spinal anesthesia (group S).
   Results: Both pre and postoperative mothers had no significant different scale of sleeping quality and stress regardless of the types of anesthesia (general or spinal) regardless of the time (timing) of cesarean section (P > 0.05). Still, mothers had a sleeping problem and stress.
   Conclusion: No correlation about sleep quality and stress scale between two anesthetic types was found. However, preoperative and postoperative laboring mothers in both groups had slight sleeping problems and stress.

AB BACKGROUND: Childhood abuse is a major global and public health problem associated with a myriad of adverse outcomes across the life course. Suicide is one of the leading causes of mortality during the perinatal period. However, few studies have assessed the relationship between experiences of childhood abuse and suicidal ideation in pregnancy.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the association between exposure to childhood abuse and suicidal ideation among pregnant women.
   STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2964 pregnant women attending prenatal clinics in Lima, Peru. Childhood abuse was assessed using the Childhood Physical and Sexual Abuse Questionnaire. Depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale. Logistic regression procedures were performed to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for potential confounders.
   RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of childhood abuse in this cohort was 71.8% and antepartum suicidal ideation was 15.8%. The prevalence of antepartum suicidal ideation was higher among women who reported experiencing any childhood abuse compared to those reporting none (89.3% vs 10.7%, P <.0001). After adjusting for potential confounders, including antepartum depression and lifetime intimate partner violence, those with history of any childhood abuse had a 2.9-fold (2.90, adjusted odds ratio; 95% confidence interval, 2.12-3.97) increased odds of reporting suicidal ideation. Women who experienced both physical and sexual childhood abuse had much higher odds of suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio, 4.04; 95% confidence interval, 2.88-5.68). Women who experienced any childhood abuse and reported depression had 3.44fold (3.44, adjusted odds ratio; 95% confidence interval, 1.84-6.43) increased odds of suicidal ideation compared with depressed women with no history of childhood abuse. Finally, the odds of suicidal ideation increased with increased number of childhood abuse events experienced (P value for linear trend <.001).
   CONCLUSION: Maternal history of childhood abuse was associated with increased odds of antepartum suicidal ideation. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the potential increased risk of suicidal behaviors among pregnant women with a history of childhood physical and sexual abuse.

AB The overall aim of this thesis was to validate the new concept of the Fertility Assessment and Counselling Clinic at Rigshospitalet. The intention was to; explore the prognostic value of fertility risk factors by a risk score and provide an estimate of female fecundity, to quantify the impact of oral contraception (OC) on ovarian reserve parameters defined as Anti Mullerian Hormone (AMH), Antral Follicle Count (AFC) and ovarian volume, and to gain knowledge of attitudes and considerations toward family formation in women of advanced age.
   The thesis is based on the following four manuscripts:
   Manuscript I describes the predictive value of individual fertility assessment and counselling in terms of subsequent time to pregnancy within two years after the initial consultation at the FAC Clinic. The follow up study comprised 519 women, of which 352 had tried to conceive.
   At the time of follow up, 259/352 had achieved a pregnancy, 74/352 were still trying and 19/352 had given up. The remaining 167 women had no attempts to conceive.
   The risk assessment provided a score based on the appearance of fertility risk factors: green (low), yellow (low), orange (medium) and red (high). Two-thirds of the women with only low risk scores conceived spontaneously within 12 months (65%), while this figure was only 32% for women with at least one high risk score (n=82). Accordingly, presence of at least one high risk score reduced the odds of achieving a pregnancy within 12 months by 73% (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.57).
   The FAC Clinic concept seems as a usable tool for fertility experts to guide women on how to fulfil their reproductive life-plan, but longer follow up studies are needed.
   Manuscript II describes the impact of OC on ovarian reserve parameters in 887 women at the FAC Clinic. Of the 887 women, 244 (27.5%) used OC. The 244 users of OC were significantly younger than non-users with a mean age of 31.5 (SD 4.3) vs. 34.1 (SD 4.3) years (P < 0.001). Overall, there was no difference between the two groups in relation to bodyweight, BMI, smoking habits, gestational age at birth, prenatal exposure to maternal smoking or maternal age at menopause. In linear regression analyses adjusted for age, ovarian volume was 50% lower, AMH was 19% lower, and AFC was 18% lower in OC-users compared to non-users. Among the OC users there was a significant decrease in antral follicles sized 5-7 and 8-10 mm and an increase in the number of small follicles sized 2-4 mm. Physicians have to be aware of the impact of OC use on ovarian reserve parameters and possible concealment of premature ovarian insufficiency, when assessing the fertility status and estimating the reproductive lifespan in OC users.
   Manuscript III describes the family intentions and personal considerations on postponing childbearing in 340 childless women of advanced age. The study comprised 140 cohabiting and 200 single women aged 35-43 seeking fertility assessment and counselling at the FAC Clinic. The majority (82%) was well-educated and in employment. Despite their mean age of 37.4 years, the main reasons for attending the FAC Clinic were to gain knowledge on the possibility of postponing pregnancy (63%) and due to a concern about their fecundity (52%). Both the cohabiting and single women expressed a wish for two or more children (60%).
   The most important benefits were "personal development" (89%) and "to give and receive love" (86%). The main concerns about childbearing were "less time to myself" (82%) and "less time to job and career" (76%). The single women were more positive regarding the use of donor sperm (70%) compared to the cohabiting women (25%).
   Our results indicated a general overestimation of the women's own reproductive capacity and an underestimation of their risk of future infertility and childlessness with continuous postponement of pregnancies.
   Manuscript IV describes attitudes toward family formation in 10 single and 10 cohabiting childless women of advanced age. The women were interviewed one week before their consultation at the FAC Clinic about their family formation intentions, considerations and concerns. The interviews were analysed and condensed into four categories:; 'The biological clock', 'The difficult choice', 'The dream of the nuclear family', and 'Mother without a father'. The categories were condensed into two subthemes; 'Fear' and 'Expectations' and gathered into one main theme 'The conflict of choosing', which reflected the women's attitudes toward family formation prior to individual fertility counselling. The women attended the FAC Clinic due to a concern about their fecundity and a fear for infertility. Overall, the women expressed a dream of the nuclear family and finding "Mr. Right" and many with the wish of buying more time. Both groups would consider solo motherhood due to their advanced age, although it was considered to be Plan B, as it was not "natural"

AB Process C (internal clock) and Process S (sleep-wake homeostasis) are the basis of sleep-wake regulation. In the last trimester of pregnancy, foetal heart rate is synchronized with the maternal circadian rhythm. At birth, this interaction fails and an ultradian rhythm appears. Light exposure is a strong factor influencing the synchronization of sleep-wake processes. However, little is known about the effects of phototherapy on the sleep rhythm of premature babies. It was hypothesized that sleep in preterm infants would not differ during phototherapy, but that a maturation effect would be seen. Sleep states were studied in 38 infants born < 32 weeks gestational age and/or < 1 500 g birth weight. Videos of 3 h were taken over the first 5 days of life. Based on breathing and movement patterns, behavioural states were defined as: awake; active sleep; or quiet sleep. Videos with and without phototherapy were compared for amounts of quiet sleep and active states (awake + active sleep). No significant association between phototherapy and amount of quiet sleep was found (P = 0.083). Analysis of videos in infants not under phototherapy revealed an increase in time spent awake with increasing gestational age. The current data suggest that the ultradian rhythm of preterm infants seems to be independent of phototherapy, supporting the notion that sleep rhythm in this population is mainly driven by their internal clock.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate sleep quality and health-related quality of life in pregnancy. In a cross-sectional design, 492 women (292 pregnant and 200 nonpregnant healthy controls) were included in this study between November 2014 and June 2015. Participants completed a survey on sociodemographic characteristics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D). The PSQI total and EQ-5D scores of pregnant women were significantly worse than the controls (P = .017 and P < .001, respectively). Linear regression analysis showed that only pregnancy status was related to PSQI scores (beta = .117; P = .009). Compared with the first trimester, the risk of poor sleep quality increased 2.11-fold in the second trimester (P = .048) and 1.86-fold in the third trimester (P = .054). Compared with the first trimester, EQ-5D scores significantly decreased in the second (P = .038) and third (P < .001) trimesters. Sleep quality and health-related quality of life of pregnant women were worse than those of nonpregnant healthy controls. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of deteriorations in sleep quality and health-related quality of life of pregnant women.

AB The maternal mortality rate for parturients with severe pulmonary hypertension is 30% to 50%. General, epidural, and combined low-dose spinal-epidural anesthesia have been used successfully for cesarean deliveries in patients with pulmonary hypertension. We describe a cesarean delivery performed using an intrathecal catheter in a 25-year-old morbidly obese (body mass index, 82 kg/m(2)) woman (gravida 3, para 2 at 32 weeks of gestation) who had severe pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, pulmonary emboli, and obstructive sleep apnea. We discuss the anesthetic considerations for parturients with severe pulmonary hypertension undergoing cesarean delivery including the selection of anesthetic technique, vasopressors, and uterotonic agents.

AB Researchers are increasingly using 24 h accelerometer wear protocols. No automated method has been published that accurately distinguishes ` waking' wear time from other data ('in- bed', non- wear, invalid days) in young adults.
   This study examined the validity of an automated algorithm developed to achieve this for hip- worn Actigraph GT3X + 60 s epoch data.
   We compared the algorithm against a referent method ('into- bed' and ` outof- bed' times visually identified by two independent raters) and benchmarked against two published algorithms. All methods used the same non- wear rules. The development sample (n = 11) and validation sample (n = 95) were Australian young adults from the Raine pregnancy cohort (54% female), all aged approximately 22 years. The agreement with Rater 1 in each minute's classification (yes/ no) of waking wear time was examined as kappa (.), limited to valid days (>= 10 h waking wear time per day) according to the algorithm and Rater 1. Bland- Altman methods assessed agreement in daily totals of waking wear and in- bed wear time.
   Excellent agreement (kappa > 0.75) was obtained between the raters for 80% of participants (median kappa = 0.94). The algorithm showed excellent agreement with Rater 1 (kappa > 0.75) for 89% of participants and poor agreement (kappa < 0.40) for 1%. In this sample, the algorithm (median kappa= 0.86) performed better than algorithms validated in children (median kappa= 0.77) and adolescents (median kappa= 0.66). The mean difference (95% limits of agreement) between Rater 1 and the algorithm was 7 (-220, 234) min d(-1) for waking wear time on valid days and -41 (-309, 228) min d(-1) for in-bed wear time.
   In this population, the automated algorithm's validity for identifying waking wear time was mostly good, not worse than inter-rater agreement, and better than the evaluated published alternatives. However, the algorithm requires improvement to better identify in-bed wear time.

AB ObjectiveTo evaluate the effect of leptin and other selected variables on gestational weight gain (GWG) according to pre-gestational body mass index (BMI).
   DesignProspective cohort.
   SettingPublic Health Center, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   SampleTwo hundred and twenty-eight pregnant women.
   MethodsWomen were followed at the 5-13, 20-26 and 30-36th gestational weeks. The effects of independent variables on GWG in normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9kg/m(2)), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9kg/m(2)) and obese (BMI30.0kg/m(2)) women were assessed using longitudinal linear mixed-effects models.
   Main outcome measureMaternal body weight (kg) throughout pregnancy.
   ResultsLeptin concentrations were associated with GWG in normal weight (=0.048, P<0.001) and overweight (=0.023, P=0.048) women, but not in obese ones (=0.011, P=0.308). Additionally, the number of hours slept per night decreased the effect of leptin on GWG in OW women (=-0.013, P=0.002). The effect of other maternal characteristics on GWG was different depending on the BMI category.
   ConclusionsLeptin concentrations were positively associated with GWG in normal weight and overweight women, but not in obese ones. Maternal height was associated with GWG in all BMI categories, but other variables such as sleep duration, QUICKI values, HDL-c, smoking habit and marital status presented differential effects according to BMI. We encourage further studies to investigate the association between leptin and gestational weight gain, taking into account the pre-pregnancy weight and sleep duration, in order to compare and confirm our results.
   Tweetable abstractLeptin is associated with weight gain in normal weight and overweight pregnant women, but not in obese ones.

AB Obesity and late-night food consumption are associated with impaired glucose tolerance. Late-night carbohydrate consumption may be particularly detrimental during late pregnancy because insulin sensitivity declines as pregnancy progresses. Further, women who were obese (Ob) prior to pregnancy have lower insulin sensitivity than do women of normal weight (NW). The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that night-time carbohydrate consumption is associated with poorer glucose tolerance in late pregnancy and that this association would be exacerbated among Ob women. Forty non-diabetic African American women were recruited based upon early pregnancy body mass index (NW, <25kgm(-2); Ob,30kgm(-2)). Third trimester free-living dietary intake was assessed by food diary, and indices of glucose tolerance and insulin action were assessed during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Women in the Ob group reported greater average 24-h energy intake (3055kcal vs. 2415kcal, P<0.05). Across the whole cohort, night-time, but not day-time, carbohydrate intake was positively associated with glucose concentrations after the glucose load and inversely associated with early phase insulin secretion (P<0.05). Multiple linear regression modelling within each weight group showed that the associations among late-night carbohydrate intake, glucose concentrations and insulin secretion were present only in the Ob group. This is the first study to report an association of night-time carbohydrate intake specifically on glucose tolerance and insulin action during pregnancy. If replicated, these results suggest that late-night carbohydrate intake may be a potential target for intervention to improve metabolic health of Ob women in late pregnancy.

AB Sleep complaints are common amongst mothers of infants and insufficient, inefficient or fragmented sleep is associated with postnatal depression. The aim of this review is to determine whether psycho social sleep-focused interventions offered in the perinatal period improve infant sleep or maternal mood. We searched PubMed, Psyclnfo, EMBASE and CINAHL with no date restriction. We reviewed 1097 articles, resulting in nine papers (n = 1,656) that fit the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the analyses. The primary outcome was infant sleep, defined as maternal reports of infant nocturnal total sleep time and number of night-time wakes. The secondary outcome was maternal mood. The meta-analysis indicated improvements in reported infant nocturnal total sleep time (Hedge's g = 0.204, p < 0.01). However, there was no evidence for reducing infant night wakes (Hedge's g = 0.103, p = 0.134). There was evidence of maternal mood improvements (Hedge's g = 0.152, p = 0.014), however, this could have been influenced by publication bias. Psychosocial sleep interventions appear to impact the amount of sleep that a mother reports her baby to have, although the infants continue to wake as frequently. More research is needed to confirm whether sleep-related improvements can translate into improvements in maternal mood. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a disease which is estimated to be undiagnosed to a large extent. Hence, the prevalence of OSAS in pregnant women is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women with chronic diseases.Methods: In the study, 97 pregnant women with chronic diseases and 160 healthy pregnant women were included. A form questioning socio-demographic characteristics and pregnancy characteristics, Epworth scale and the Berlin questionnaire to evaluate the risk of OSAS were applied to participants.Results: It has been determined that 10-12.5% of healthy pregnant women, 34-45.4% of pregnants with chronic diseases and 20.6-23.3% of all pregnant women had a high risk of OSAS, the pregnants with chronic disease compared to healthy pregnant women had statistically significant higher risk of OSAS. The risk of OSAS was found to be significantly higher especially in pregnant women with hypertension and diabetes.Conclusions: OSAS can lead to the adverse consequences in pregnancy, should be questioned for all pregnants especially those with chronic diseases. Pregnant women with OSAS should be monitored more carefully in terms of diabetes and hypertension in antenatal care.

AB Background: During pregnancy, a sedentary lifestyle may have negative consequences on maternal and foetal health status. The main objective of this project is to assess the effects of an exercise intervention in overweight and grade I obese pregnant on maternal and foetal health markers.
   Methods/design: The present study aims to recruit 60 overweight and grade I obese women interested in participating in an exercise intervention program from the 17th gestational week until delivery. Women will be randomized to either an exercise (three 60-min sessions/week of combined aerobic and strength training and pelvic floor exercises), or usual care (control) group (30 women per group). The primary outcome measures are maternal weight gain, and maternal and neonatal glycaemic profile. Secondary outcome measures are: i) perinatal obstetric records; i) body composition; iii) dietary patterns; iv) physical fitness; v) low-back pain; vi) objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour; vii) haematology and biochemical analyses; viii) oxidative stress; ix) pro- and anti-inflammatory markers; x) bone health biomarkers; xi) sleep quality; xii) mental health, quality of life and positive health.
   Discussion: The findings of this project will help to identify strategies for primary prevention and health promotion based on this exercise-based intervention program among overweight and grade I obese pregnant women.

ID EARLY POSTPARTUM; PREGNANCY; PREVALENCE; INSOMNIA; DISORDERS; INDEX
AB Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common during pregnancy and the postnatal period. A risk factor for mood disorders is poor sleep quality. In this study we investigate the effects of poor subjective prenatal sleep quality on postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, independent of prenatal depression or anxiety, amongst pregnant women in the general population.
   Methods: We analysed data from a subset of women taking part in a prospective cohort study, Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes. The participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory between 26 and 28 weeks of pregnancy (Time 1) and at 3 months postpartum (Time 2), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at Time 1. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between subjective prenatal sleep quality and postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, while adjusting for prenatal depressive/anxiety symptoms and education.
   Results: Although borderline-high depressive/anxiety symptoms were the strongest predictors of postnatal depressive/anxiety, independent of this, poor subjective sleep quality during pregnancy was also associated with borderline-high postnatal depressive symptoms, but not with postnatal anxiety. Limitations: Sleep quality and prenatal/postnatal mood were derived from self-reported questionnaires, which may be more susceptible to bias.
   Conclusion: Although treatment of symptoms of prenatal depression and anxiety will be the most important for reducing postnatal depression and anxiety, in addition to that, future studies may explore treatments improving prenatal sleep quality, particularly for women with antenatal depressive symptoms.

This study is based on self-report data from a Norwegian cohort, the AHUS Birth Cohort Study. Data were collected at 8 weeks (T1) and 2 years (T2) postpartum. Data from 812 women were analyzed. The results showed that only women with symptoms of insomnia at both T1 and T2 (persistent symptoms) had a greater increase in body mass index compared to women with no insomnia symptoms at T1 or T2. The results indicate that persistent insomnia symptoms are related to a greater increase in body mass index.

AB Objective: To examine the relationship between prenatal maternal stress, resilience, and sleep quality, and to determine whether resilience plays a mediating role in the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality among pregnant women.
   Methods: Two hundred and thirty-one pregnant women in their second trimester participated in the study. They completed questionnaires, including: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS), and the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). A structural equation model was used to analyze the relationships among prenatal maternal stress, resilience, and sleep quality, with resilience as a mediator.
   Results: Prenatal maternal stress was negatively associated with sleep quality in pregnant women (p < 0.01), whereas resilience was positively associated with sleep quality (p < 0.01). Furthermore, resilience mediated the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality, and the mediation effect ratio was 22.0% (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: The risk factor for disturbed sleep was pregnancy-specific stress; however, the protective factor for sleep quality was resilience. This finding could provide scientific evidence for the development of intervention strategies with which to improve sleep quality in pregnant women. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High serotonin levels during pregnancy affect central nervous system development. Whether a commonly used antidepressant such as fluoxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) taken during pregnancy may adversely affect respiratory control in offspring has not been determined. The objective was to determine the effect of prenatal-perinatal fluoxetine exposure on the respiratory neural network in offspring, particularly on central chemoreception. Osmotic minipumps implanted into CF-1 mice on Days 5-7 of pregnancy delivered 7 milligrams per kilogram per day of fluoxetine, achieving plasma levels within the range found in patients. Ventilation was assessed in offspring at postnatal Days 0-40 using head-out body plethysmography. Neuronal activation was evaluated in the raphe nuclei and in the nucleus tractus solitarius by c-Fos immunohistochemistry during normoxic eucapnia and hypercapnia (10% CO2). Respiratory responses to acidosis were evaluated in brainstem slices. Prenatal-perinatal fluoxetine did not affect litter size, birth weight, or the postnatal growth curve. Ventilation under eucapnic normoxic conditions was similar to that of control offspring. Fluoxetine exposure reduced ventilatory responses to hypercapnia at P8-P40 (P < 0.001) but not at P0-P5. At P8, it reduced hypercapnia-induced neuronal activation in raphe nuclei (P < 0.05) and nucleus tractus solitarius (P < 0.01) and the acidosis-induced increase in the respiratory frequency in brainstem slices (P < 0.05). Fluoxetine applied acutely on control slices did not modify their respiratory response to acidosis. We concluded that prenatal-perinatal fluoxetine treatment impairs central respiratory chemoreception during postnatal life. These results are relevant in understanding the pathogenesis of respiratory failures, such as sudden infant death syndrome, associated with brainstem serotonin abnormalities and the failure of respiratory chemoreflexes.

AB Objectives. The role of stress in the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has so far been neglected. We investigated the impact of stress exposure (pregnancy-related and pregnancy-unrelated major life events), psychological stress responses (perceived stress, subjective experience of stress, anxiety, depression, sleep), and physiological stress responses (salivary cortisol, plasma copeptin levels) on glucose concentrations during pregnancy.
   Design. Cross-sectional study, including 203 pregnant women at the maternity department of a Swiss university hospital.
   Methods. All women underwent routine screening for GDM with a 75-g oral glucose-tolerance test at 24-30 weeks of gestation. Pregnancy-related and pregnancy-unrelated major life events, perceived stress, general psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and amount of sleep were assessed by validated self-report questionnaires. Cortisol was measured using fasting and bedtime saliva samples, and copeptin using fasting plasma. All data were collected before communication of the screening test results.
   Results. Significant positive associations were found between the number of pregnancy-related major life events and fasting glucose, while there was no association with pregnancy-unrelated major life events. More anxiety and depressive symptoms, a higher general level of distress, and a shorter duration of sleep were related to fasting glucose, although the latter two were no longer significant when age and BMI were controlled for. However, physiological stress responses were not associated with glucose concentrations. When testing for unique associations with fasting glucose, more general distress and shorter duration of sleep independently accounted for higher fasting glucose levels. Finally, when comparing women with and without GDM, we found that women who subsequently received the diagnosis of GDM reported more pregnancy-related life events.
   Conclusions. Some indicators of stress exposure and psychological stress responses were associated with fasting glucose concentrations in pregnant women, thus representing important risk factors for GDM development.

AB Maternal adaptations in lipid metabolism are crucial for pregnancy success due to the role of white adipose tissue as an energy store and the dynamic nature of energy needs across gestation. Because lipid metabolism is regulated by the rhythmic expression of clock genes, it was hypothesized that maternal metabolic adaptations involve changes in both adipose clock gene expression and the rhythmic expression of downstream metabolic genes. Maternal core body temperature (T-c) was investigated as a possible mechanism driving pregnancy-induced changes in clock gene expression. Gonadal adipose tissue and plasma were collected from C57BL/6J mice before and on days 6, 10, 14, and 18 of pregnancy (term 19 d) at 4-hour intervals across a 24-hour period. Adipose expression of clock genes and downstream metabolic genes were determined by quantitative RT-PCR, and T-c was measured by intraperitoneal temperature loggers. Adipose clock gene expression showed robust rhythmicity throughout pregnancy, but absolute levels varied substantially across gestation. Rhythmic expression of the metabolic genes Lipe, Pnpla2, and Lpl was clearly evident before pregnancy; however, this rhythmicity was lost with the onset of pregnancy. T-c rhythm was significantly altered by pregnancy, with a 65% decrease in amplitude by term and a 0.61 degrees C decrease in mesor between days 6 and 18. These changes in T-c, however, did not appear to be linked to adipose clock gene expression across pregnancy. Overall, our data show marked adaptations in the adipose clock in pregnancy, with an apparent decoupling of adipose clock and lipolytic/lipogenic gene rhythms from early in gestation.

AB Depression has been linked to an imbalance in cortisol. Until recently, cortisol has been studied by measuring concentrations at single time points in blood or saliva samples. Cortisol concentrations vary with circadian rhythm and experiences, from time point to time point. The measurement of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is a new method of accessing mean, long-term cortisol concentrations. Recent studies show positive associations between depression and HCC, and prenatal maternal cortisol is thought to influence the developing fetus. We therefore examined the association between HCC and self-reported symptoms of depression in second trimester pregnant women. Participants were 181 women, recruited between September 2011 and October 2013 to the Little-in-Norway (LiN)-study. These women answered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Rating Scale (EPDS) on self-reported symptoms of depression, and one cm maternal scalp hair was collected and analyzed for cortisol concentrations. Multiple regression analyses did not show depressive symptoms as a predictor for HCC in our selection of pregnant women, while gestational age was significantly related. In conclusion, our study indicated that symptoms of depression during pregnancy did not predict HCC, but further studies of clinically depressed, pregnant women using gestational age as an adjustment variable are warranted.

SO ARCHIVES DE PEDIATRIE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE; RISK
AB Objective. Skin-to-skin contact shows benefits in the relationship developed between a mother and her premature infant. In the skin-to skin session, face-to-face exchanges are impossible in vertical infant positioning. We therefore undertook an observational, prospective, single-center study using kangaroo "supported diagonal flexion" (SDF) positioning. The first aim was to evaluate the safety of kangaroo SDF positioning compared to the usual vertical positioning. The second aim was to evaluate SDF positioning on early communication between the mother and her infant and to improve their well-being.
   Participants and setting. Fifteen mothers and their very premature infants (birth 26 < 32 weeks' gestation) were assigned to one of the two kangaroo positioning modes, either the current vertical positioning (n = 7) or SDF positioning (n = 8).
   Design. Physiological variables and critical events were recorded before, during, and after ten successive skin-to-skin contact sessions. The first and last sessions were videotaped to allow later behavioral measurements. Mothers' risk for depression and feelings about the way they experienced communication with their infant were assessed through questionnaires.
   Results. In terms of the infant's physiology, no negative effects were associated with SDF positioning in comparison with the usual vertical positioning. SDF positioning led to fewer disorganized gestures, negative vocalizations, and drowsiness, in favor of more deep sleep. SDF led to more mother infant eye-to-eye contact as well as maternal vocalizations, smiles, and caressing, although these differences did not reach significance. The score for the risk of postnatal depression decreased significantly between the first and the last session in the SDF group, whereas it did not change in the vertical positioning group.
   Conclusion. These results support the idea that the kangaroo SDF positioning technique is physiologically safe, has obvious immediate benefits on mothers' infant-directed communicative behaviors, and respects the baby's naturally flexed and asymmetrical tonic neck posture. It is an innovative, inexpensive, easy-to-use technique in daily practice, by all healthcare professionals working in a neonatal intensive care unit. These data suggest that the current kangaroo positioning technique could be improved. More studies are needed to confirm the. benefits and safety of the kangaroo SDF positioning in larger groups of preterm infants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Antenatal stress has been associated with adverse outcomes in mothers and their children. However, little research has been conducted to identify the factors associated with psychosocial stress in pregnant women.
   Purpose: This study explored the predictors of psychosocial stress during pregnancy.
   Methods: A convenience sample of 136 second-trimester and 164 third-trimester pregnant women were recruited from a medical center in southern Taiwan. Data were collected using a demographic form, Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS), Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List.
   Results: The results of this study found positive correlations between PSRS and both Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale (r = .368, p < .01) and Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale (r = .168, p < .01) and negative correlations between PSRS and both gravidity (r = -.137, p < .05) and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (r = -.266, p < .01). Higher pregnancy stress was predicted by depression, lower social support, maternal-fetal attachment, and primigravid status, which together explained 20% of the total variance.
   Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Depression, social support, maternal-fetal attachment, and gravidity are discrete predictive factors of psychosocial stress in pregnant women. These findings add to existing knowledge of the factors associated with prenatal stress. Future research should include depression in a support model of antenatal stress management.

AB Background: Exposure to road traffic noise has been associated with adiposity and diabetes in adults. The suggested pathways have been through sleep disturbance and stress. Children may be particularly susceptible to noise induced sleep disturbance and stress and the effects hereof.
   Objectives: To examine the association between traffic noise exposure during pregnancy and early childhood and adiposity in children.
   Methods: We identified 40,974 singletons from the Danish National Birth Cohort with parentally given questionnaire information on weight and height at 7-years of age. Road and railway traffic noise were modeled at all historical addresses and expressed as time-weighted means for two exposure periods (pregnancy and childhood). Adiposity was assessed using BMI z-scores and a dichotomous measure of childhood overweight based on age and sex specific cut-offs. Associations were analyzed using linear regression for BMI z-scores and logistic regression for risk of childhood overweight, adjusting for socioeconomic position, maternal BMI, maternal smoking, maternal age, parity and degree of urbanization.
   Results: We found both pregnancy and childhood exposure to road traffic noise to be associated with a higher risk for childhood overweight (odds ratio (OR) = 1.06 per 10 dB, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.12 for exposure during pregnancy and OR = 1.06 per 10 dB, 95% CI: 0.99-1.12 for childhood exposure). There were no associations between road traffic noise and BMI z-scores. We found no associations between railway noise and adiposity.
   Conclusions: We found suggestions of a positive association between road traffic noise and risk of overweight in 7-years old children. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective Only 9 % of women with young children consume a high quality diet. The association between sleep duration and health may be U-shaped. We examined diet quality in relation to sleep duration among US women within 5 years of childbirth. Methods Data were from non-pregnant women aged 20-44 years within 5 years of childbirth who completed two 24-h dietary recalls (N = 896) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2012. Self-reported weekday/workday sleep duration was categorized as short (aecurrency sign6 h), adequate (7-8 h), or long (aeyen9 h). The Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010, range 0-100) estimated overall and components of diet quality. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models estimated the association between sleep duration and diet quality, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and education. Results Thirty-four percent of women reported short, 57.1 % adequate, and 8.6 % long sleep duration. The average diet quality total score was 47.4 out of 100. Short sleep duration was not associated with diet quality. Long sleep duration was associated with lower quality diet (beta = -4.3; 95 % CI -8.1 to -0.4), lower consumption of total fruit (beta = -0.7; 95 % CI -1.3 to -0.1), whole fruit (beta = -0.9; 95 % CI -1.6 to -0.2), and total protein (beta = -0.7; 95 % CI -1.3 to -0.03), and higher consumption of empty calories (beta = 2.2; 95 % CI -4.3 to -0.1). Conclusions for practice Future studies should examine the longitudinal association between sleep duration and diet quality among women following childbirth and whether interventions to improve sleep can enhance diet quality.

TI Peripartum Management for Patients with mental illnesses Strategies to
   Reduce Relapse after Childbirth
SO NERVENARZT
LA German
DT Article
ID BIPOLAR DISORDER; PREGNANCY; WOMEN; PSYCHOSIS; PERIOD; RISK
AB Transition to parenthood is challenging but for women with a history of recurrent psychiatric disorders becoming a mother has a number of additional issues. Women with a history of mood disorders or psychoses are at increased risk for exacerbation in the vulnerable postpartum period and fear the potential risk of medication during pregnancy for the unborn child as much as they fear a relapse. In these difficult situations women and their families seek advice and support from mental health providers and obstetricians.
   Based on the treatment of 420 mentally ill women with a desire to have children and pregnancy and prospective documentation of 196 pregnancies over the last 10 years (2006-2016) the authors developed the Bonn concept of peripartum management (BKPM). The plan was designed to reduce the incidence and severity of postpartum relapses in women suffering from psychiatric disorders. Factors to be considered include antenatal and postpartum medication as well as reduction of stress and stimuli, sleep preservation, social support and help from the partner in caring for the baby. Of the 196 women in the BKPM only 4.6 % (n = 9) experienced a severe postpartum relapse with hospitalization. Additionally, the informed consent discussion with patient and partner as part of the peripartum management plan showed positive effects on how women and their families experienced autonomy and safety during pregnancy and postpartum.
   Careful planning and monitoring with a structured perinatal management plan can reduce the risk of relapse in the perinatal period and thus support women with a history of mental disorder in the transition to motherhood. Therefore, the management concept employed in Bonn contributes to the major goal of current peripartum psychiatric care in developing effective prevention strategies for women at high risk.

AB The postpartum period in a woman's life is filled with numerous changes, including physical changes, changes in sleep habits, and learning how to best care for a newborn. A common goal among postpartum women is to either begin or resume an active lifestyle, which often includes physical activity such as running, biking and swimming. The postpartum athlete may discover barriers that prevent her from returning to or beginning an exercise routine. These obstacles include muscle weakness, fatigue, depression and physical changes that require exercise modification. The physical therapist is well-suited to properly assess, treat and manage the care of the postpartum athlete. Postpartum athletes wishing to begin or resume training for triathlons require special consideration, as the triathlete must balance training to compete in three different sports.
   The purpose of the paper is to identify the unique physical and physiological changes that occur to the female during the postpartum period. In addition, injuries that are more commonly seen during the postpartum period will be discussed. Recommendations for beginning or resuming an exercise program will be reviewed. Lastly, sport-specific training for the postpartum triathlete, including challenges presented with each triathlon component, will be discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to preterm delivery (PTD), using the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ).
   This was a large, prospective cohort study among pregnant Thai women. The BQ was employed for symptom-based OSA screening during the second trimester, and PTD was recorded in 1345 pregnant women. Multivariate models were applied in controlling for potential confounders.
   The overall prevalence of the high risk of OSA was 10.1 %, and it was significantly associated with pre-pregnancy body mass index and score on the Perceived Stress Scale. An adjusted odds ratio for PTD in women with a high risk of OSA was 2.00 (95 % confidence intervals (CIs) = 1.20, 3.34). Stratified analyses, after adjusting for confounding factors, indicated that a high risk of OSA was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (odds ratio (OR) = 2.45, 95 % CI = 1.20, 5.02), but not with preterm premature rupture of membranes (OR = 1.61, 95 % CI = 0.61, 4.26), and medically indicated preterm delivery (OR = 1.83, 95 % CI = 0.72, 4.64).
   Pregnant women with a high risk of OSA are at an increased risk of having PTD, compared with pregnant women with a low risk of OSA.

AB OBJECTIVE: Supine sleep positioning (SSP) has been shown to reduce the risk of sudden infant cleat!) syndrome (SIDS) and preterm infants are at higher risk for SIDS. Population-based estimates of SSP are lacking for the preterm population. The objectives of this study are: (1) compare the prevalence of SSP after hospital discharge for preterm and term infants in the United States; and (2) assess racial/ethnic disparities in SSP for preterm and term infants. STUDY
   DESIGN: We analyzed the 2000 to 2011 data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 35 states. We measured prevalence of SSP by preterm and term gestational age (GA) categories. We calculated adjusted prevalence ratios (APR) to evaluate the likelihood of SSP for each GA category compared with term infants and the likelihood of SSP for non-Hispanic black (NHB) and Hispanic infants compared with non-Hispanic white (NHW) infants.
   RESULTS: Prevalence of SSP varied by GA: <= 27, 59.7%; 28 0/7 to 33 6/7, 63.7%; 34 0/7 to 36 6/7 (late preterm), 63.6%; and 37 0/7 to 42 6/7 (term) weeks, 66.8% (P < 0.001). In the adjusted analyses, late preterm infants were slightly less likely to be placed in SSP compared with term infants (APR: 0.96, confidence interval: 0.95 to 0.98). There were racial/ethnic disparities in SSP for all GA categories when NHB and Hispanic infants were compared with NHW infants.
   CONCLUSIONS: All infants had suboptimal adherence to SSP indicating a continued need to better engage families about SSP. Parents of late preterm infants and families of NHB and Hispanic infants will also require greater attention given their decreased likelihood of SSP.

AB Background Mental health disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide, including in first-time mothers. Understanding the associations between diet and depressive symptoms could assist in improving mental health status in this group.
   Objective Our aim was to determine the association between diet quality, fruit, vegetable, and fish consumption and depressive symptoms in first-time mothers aged 19 to 45 years.
   Design We analyzed cross-sectional, baseline data (3 months postpartum) from the Melbourne InFANT (Infant Feeding, Activity, and Nutrition Trial) Extend Program.
   Participants/setting Participants were first-time Australian mothers aged 19 to 45 years from the Geelong and Melbourne regions of Victoria, Australia (n=457).
   Main outcome measures A self-administered, 137-item food frequency questionnaire assessed dietary intake over the past year. Adherence to the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines was assessed using the Dietary Guideline Index as a measure of diet quality. Depressive symptoms were determined using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.
   Statistical analysis performed Relationships between diet quality, fruit, vegetable, and fish intake and depressive symptoms were investigated using linear regression adjusted for relevant covariates (age, smoking status, sleep quality, education, physical activity status, and body mass index).
   Results Better diet quality, as indicated by a higher score on the Dietary Guideline Index, was associated with lower depressive symptoms after adjusting for relevant covariates (beta=-.034; 95% CI -.056 to -0.012). There were no other associations between dietary intake and depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions Adherence to the Australian Dietary Guidelines was associated with better mental health status among first-time mothers. Further research, including longitudinal and intervention studies, are required to determine causality between dietary intake and depressive symptoms, which might help inform future public health nutrition programs for this target group.

AB Yoga is a mind-body practice that encompasses a system of postures (asana), deep breathing (pranayama), and meditation. Over 36 million Americans practice yoga of which the majority are reproductive-aged women. Literature to support this practice is limited, albeit on the rise. A prenatal yoga practice has been shown to benefit women who suffer from anxiety, depression, stress, low back pain, and sleep disturbances. A small number of studies have been performed in high-risk pregnancies that also demonstrate an improvement in outcomes. The safety of performing yoga for the first time in pregnancy and fetal tolerance has been demonstrated.

AB Importance: African American women living in urban, low-income environments are at high risk for poor nutrition during pregnancy and birth complications.
   Objective: To test the effectiveness of prenatal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on birth outcomes and infant development in a sample of African American women with Medicaid insurance and living in the city of Pittsburgh.
   Design: The Nutrition and Pregnancy Study (NAPS) is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of prenatal DHA supplementation conducted between 2012 and 2014.
   Setting: Participants were recruited from obstetric clinics at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
   Participants: Sixty-four pregnant, African American women were enrolled at 16-21 weeks of gestation and randomized to either 450 mg/day of DHA (22:6n-3)(n = 43) or a soybean placebo (n = 21). Four women (6.3%) withdrew from the study: two participants from each study arm; complete data were obtained for 49 infants (76.5%) at the 3-month assessment.
   Interventions: Supplementation with DHA or placebo continued from the beginning of enrollment through delivery.
   Main outcome and measures: Data on birth outcomes were collected from medical records. At approximately 3 months post-partum, mothers brought their infants to the laboratory where the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) were administered and cortisol response to the Face-to-Face Still-Face (FFSF) paradigm was assessed.
   Results: Infants of mothers who received DHA supplementation had higher birth weight (3.174g versus 2.890g) than infants of mothers receiving placebo (F [2.40] = 6.09, p = 0.018, eta = 0.36), and were more likely to have a 1-min Apgar score greater than 8 (OR = 5.99 [95% CI = 1.25-28.75], p = 0.025). Infants of mothers who received DHA compared with infants of mothers receiving placebo had lower levels of cortisol in response to the FFSF paradigm (F [1.32] = 5.36, p = 0.018, eta = 0.36). None of the scores on the BSID-III differed as a function of active supplement versus placebo.
   Conclusions: Infants of women living in urban, low-income environments who received DHA supplementation had more optimal birth outcomes and more modulated cortisol response to a stressor. DHA supplementation may be effective in attenuating the negative effects of prenatal stress on offspring development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   EXPERIENCE; SPECTRUM; EPISODES; PATIENT
AB Background
   Women with bipolar disorder are at increased risk of having a severe episode of illness associated with childbirth. Aims To explore the factors that influence the decision-making of women with bipolar disorder regarding pregnancy and childbirth.
   Method
   Qualitative study with a purposive sample of women with bipolar disorder considering pregnancy, or currently or previously pregnant, supplemented by data from an online forum. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results
   Twenty-one women with bipolar disorder from an NHS organisation were interviewed, and data were used from 50 women's comments via the online forum of the UK's national bipolar charity. The centrality of motherhood, social and economic contextual factors, stigma and fear were major themes. Within these themes, new findings included women considering an elective Caesarian section in an attempt to avoid the deleterious effects of a long labour and loss of sleep, or trying to avoid the risks of pregnancy altogether by means of adoption or surrogacy.
   Conclusions
   This study highlights the information needs of women with bipolar disorder, both pre-conception and when childbearing, and the need for improved training for all health professionals working with women with bipolar disorder of childbearing age to reduce stigmatising attitudes and increase knowledge of the evidence base on treatment in the perinatal period.

AB Sleep disorder is common in pregnancy. Sleep disturbance in pregnant women can cause an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes, including anxiety, fatigue, depression during pregnancy and after delivery, maternal diabetes, etc. Therefore, due to the importance of the subject, this study was to evaluate the prevalence of sleep disorders in pregnancy and some of the associated factors in Hamadan city, Iran in 2015. This case-control study was carried out on 385 pregnant women (case: sleep disorder, n=176; control: without sleep disorder, n=209) referred to health centers in Hamadan. Cluster sampling was done. The measures used in this study included demographic questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. The results showed that 45.7% of the pregnant women suffered from moderate to severe poor sleep quality. The average of PSQI score was 6.83 +/- 3.17. No significant differences were found in gravidity, age, body mass index(BMI), job, different work shifts, husband's occupation, husband's education, prenatal care and how to get it, wanted or unwanted pregnancy, family income, house status, being satisfied with the sex of the fetus, smoker husband, being satisfied with husband's support, and getting support from her family between the two groups. In another hand, statistically significant differences were found in gestational age, education, BMI ranging, sexual satisfaction, being satisfied with getting support from husband's family, and being satisfied with sleep quality before pregnancy between two groups. Most of pregnant women experienced sleep disorder in pregnancy. Due to factors affecting the sleep quality, measures should be taken to improve quality of sleep in pregnant women.

TI Collaborating with obstetrical providers to promote infant safe sleep
   guidelines
SO SLEEP HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE SUID; Education; Infant mortality; SIDS
AB Objectives: To partner with obstetrical providers to increase promotion of the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for infant safe sleep. Specifically, this study evaluates the effectiveness of the Safe Sleep Toolkit during obstetrical visits. Secondary objectives include improving provider and maternal knowledge of safe sleep.
   Methods: Obstetrical providers (n=11) and staff at an outpatient clinic were trained using the Safe Sleep Toolkit and encouraged to discuss infant safe sleep with pregnant women at their 28- or 36-week gestation appointment (n =111, 56 pre-and 55 post-intervention). Provider-reported time spent counseling women on safe sleep recommendations and safe sleep knowledge was measured before and after the intervention. Surveys were conducted with women assessing safe sleep knowledge, intention to follow guide-lines, and whether safe sleep was discussed at the appointment.
   Results: Significantly more post-intervention women reported their provider had discussed safe sleep (78% vs 32%) (P < .001). Similarly, provider-reported discussion with women increased significantly for all safe sleep guidelines (82%-90% vs 8%-12%) (all P < .001). Maternal knowledge, especially surrounding unsafe sleep practices, improved significantly post-intervention.
   Conclusion: Training obstetricians to use a toolkit to promote infant safe sleep guidelines increases the prenatal delivery of this information, and improves pregnant women's knowledge and intentions regarding safe infant sleep.

DE Sleep; Circadian; DLMO; Pregnancy; Postpartum; Postpartum weight
   retention
AB Objective: This study assessed sleep and circadian rhythms across the perinatal period in new mothers with and without postpartum weight retention (PPWR).
   Methods: Weight was measured at 2 and 16 weeks postpartum in 21 women with previous major depression or bipolar disorder (mean age, 29.5 +/- 4.7 years) who self-reported pre-pregnancy weight during third trimester. Wrist actigraphy was acquired at 33 weeks gestation and postpartum weeks 2, 6, and 16. Circadian phase was measured at 33 weeks gestation and 6 weeks postpartum. The Horne-Ostberg Momingness-Eveningness Questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory were completed during third trimester. Women were classified as PPWR+ if weight at 16 weeks postpartum exceeded pre-pregnancy weight by >= 5 kg.
   Results: Compared with prepregnancy, average weight gain (+/- SD) was 63 +/- 8.8 kg at 2 weeks postpartum and 5.2 +/- 8.5 kg at 16 weeks postpartum. Analysis of variance showed that PPWR + women (n = 8; 38%) had later sleep offset times and lower sleep efficiencies than did PPWR - women at all time points and were more likely to report snoring during pregnancy.
   Conclusions: Data from this small sample showed that women with PPWR had more disturbed sleep and later wake times and were more likely to report symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing. Future work in larger samples should examine whether interventions to improve sleep during pregnancy decrease PPWR. (C) 2016 National Sleep Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Early childhood is a critical time for establishing physical activity and sedentary behaviours. Identifying modifiable predictors of physical activity and sedentary behaviours in the early life stages can inform the development of early intervention programs. The aim of this study was to identify modifiable predictors of outdoor play (a proxy of physical activity) and screen-time in 2- to 5-year-olds.
   Methods: A longitudinal data analysis was conducted using 5-year follow-up data from the Healthy Beginnings Trial undertaken in Sydney, Australia from 2007 to 2013. A total of 667 pregnant women were recruited for the study. Information on mothers' demographics, physical activity, screen-time, knowledge of child development, and awareness of childhood obesity during pregnancy (at baseline); children's tummy time (a colloquial term describing the time when a baby is placed on his or her stomach while awake and supervised) at 6 months old and screen-time at 1 year old was collected via interviews with participating mothers as potential modifiable predictors. Main outcomes were children's outdoor playtime and screen-time at ages 2, 3.5, and 5 years. Mixed linear and logistic regression models were built to determine these modifiable predictors.
   Results: Mothers' screen-time during pregnancy (beta = 2.1, 95 % CI 0.17-4.12; P = 0.030) and children's daily screen-time at age 1 year (beta = 15.2, 95 % CI 7.28-23.11; P < 0.0001) predicted children's daily screen-time across ages 2 to 5 years after controlling for confounding factors. Practising tummy time daily (beta = 13.4, 95 % CI 1.26-25.52; P = 0.030), mother's physical activity level (beta = 3.9, 95 % CI 0.46-7.28; P = 0.026), and having been informed about playing with child at baseline (beta = 11.6, 95 % CI 1.56-21.54; P = 0.023) predicted children's outdoor playtime across ages 2 to 5 years.
   Conclusions: Mothers played an important role in their children's outdoor play and screen-time in the first years of live. Children's early exposure to screen devices could be associated with their later screen-time. Early interventions to improve young children's physical activity and sedentary behaviour should focus on improving pregnant women's physical activity, awareness of playing with their child, reducing their own screen-time as well as practicing daily tummy time for infants after giving birth.

AB Background: There are no data on the burden of malaria in pregnancy (MiP) in Laos, where malaria still remains prevalent in the south.
   Methods: Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2014 to assess the prevalence of MiP in Vapi District, Salavan Province, southern Laos: the first consisted of screening 204 pregnant women during pregnancies [mean (95 % CI) gestational age: 23 (22-25) weeks] living in 30 randomly selected villages in Vapi District; the second was conducted among 331 pregnant women, who delivered during the study period in Vapi and Toumlane District Hospitals and in Salavan Provincial Hospital. Peripheral and placental malaria was detected using rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), thick blood smears (TBS) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR). Factors associated with low birth weight (LBW) and maternal anaemia were assessed.
   Results: In the villages, 12/204 women (5.9 %; 95 % CI 3.1-10.0) were infected with malaria as determined by RT-qPCR: 11 were Plasmodium vivax infections and 1 was mixed Plasmodium vivax/Plasmodium falciparum infection, among which 9 were sub-microscopic (as not detected by TBS). History of malaria during current pregnancy tended to be associated with a higher risk of MiP (aIRR 3.05; 95 % CI 0.94-9.88). At delivery, two Plasmodium falciparum submicroscopic infections (one peripheral and one placental) were detected (4.5 %; 0.6-15.5) in Vapi District. In both surveys, all infected women stated they had slept under a bed net the night before the survey, and 86 % went to the forest for food-finding 1 week before the survey in median. The majority of infections (94 %) were asymptomatic and half of them were associated with anaemia. Overall, 24 % of women had LBW newborns. Factors associated with a higher risk of LBW were tobacco use (aIRR 2.43; 95 % CI 1.64-3.60) and pre-term delivery (aIRR 3.17; 95 % CI 2.19-4.57). Factors associated with a higher risk of maternal anaemia were no iron supplementation during pregnancy, Lao Theung ethnicity and place of living.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of MiP in this population was noticeable. Most infections were asymptomatic and submicroscopic vivax malaria, which raises the question of reliability of recommended national strategies for the screening and prevention of MiP in Laos.

AB BACKGROUND: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a complex and multifactorial disease. Stressful situations experienced could be related to the presentation of the disease. Few studies have determined which factors could trigger CFS. The main objective of this study was to explore the stressful situations which can be associated with CFS presentation.
   METHODS: Retrospective observational case-control study with CFS diagnosed patients according to the Fukuda's criteria. Controls were matched to cases by sex, age and educational level with a 1:1 ratio. Participants aged between 18 and 75 years from the province of Lleida. Information was obtained through personal questionnaires. The measure of association was the odds ratio.
   RESULTS: In total, 77 cases and 77 controls were included. Association found between stressful life events and presentation of disease were pregnancy ORa=31.7 (CI95%:2.2-456.7), spousal abuse ORa= 10.2 (CI95%:1.2-88.4) and mobbing ORa=6.9 (CI95%:1.3-36.9), eating disorders=7.5 (CI95%:1.3-42.1), car accident ORa=5.5 (CI95%:1.7-17 9), economic problems ORa=5.1 (CI95%:2.1-12.6) and changes in sleep habits ORa=2.8 (CI95%:1.1-7.5).
   CONCLUSIONS: Stressful life events as pregnancy, spousal abuse, mobbing, eating disorders, car accident, economic problems and changes in sleep habits felt by those affected must be taken into consideration when compiling background information related to the onset of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Adequate identification of these stressful life events in risk people could contribute to early diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

AB Background: Domestic violence during pregnancy is not only a severe public health issue that jeopardizes maternal and foetal health but also violates human rights. The aim was to explore the prevalence and incidence of domestic violence among pregnant women, in the southwestern region of Scania in Sweden, and their experience of a history of violence. In addition, to explore the association between domestic violence during pregnancy and possible risk factors.
   Methods: This is a longitudinal cohort-study including pregnant women >= 18 years of age, registered at antenatal care when pregnant. A cohort of 1939 pregnant women answered Questionnaire I (QI) in gestational week 13 (mean 12.8 week, SD 5.11). Response rate of Questionnaire II (QII) in gestation week 34 (mean 33.9 week, SD 2.2) was 78.8 % (n = 1527). Statistical analysis was descriptive statistics, logistic regression and multiple regression with Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI).
   Results: Both QI and QII were completed by 77.8 % (n = 1509) of the women and 44.3 % (n = 668) reported a lifetime experience of abuse irrespective of type, severity or perpetrator. Also, 5.1 % (n = 77) reported some experience of abuse past year. Prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy was 2.0 % (n = 29) and the incidence was 7.3 new cases per 1000 women. The strongest risk factor for domestic violence, during early and late pregnancy, was history of violence whereby all women who disclosed exposure had also reported history of violence (p < 0.001). To be single/living apart gave 8.4 times more risk associated with domestic violence during pregnancy (AOR 8.4; 95 % CI: 2.2-32.6). Having several symptoms of depression and lack of sleep gave 3.8 times more risk respectively (AOR 3.8; 95 % CI: 1.1-13.6) and (AOR 3.8; 95 % CI 1.1-12.9).
   Conclusions: Pregnant women with a history of violence as well as being single/living apart and/or having several symptoms of depression during pregnancy should be alerts for clinical working midwives and obstetricians. Further, this is important knowledge for health care providers to develop or upgrade guidelines and plans of action for pregnant women exposed to violence.

AB Rhythmic incremental growth lines and the presence of melatonin receptors were discovered in tooth enamel, suggesting possible role of circadian rhythm. We therefore hypothesized that circadian rhythm may regulate enamel formation through melatonin receptors. To test this hypothesis, we examined expression of melatonin receptors (MTs) and amelogenin (AMELX), a maker of enamel formation, during tooth germ development in mouse. Using qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, we found that mRNA and protein levels of both MTs and AMELX in normal mandibular first molar tooth germs increased gradually after birth, peaked at 3 or 4 day postnatal, and then decreased. Expression of MTs and AMELX by immunocytochemistry was significantly delayed in neonatal mice raised in all-dark or all-light environment as well as the enamel development. Furthermore, development of tooth enamel was also delayed showing significant immature histology in those animals, especially for newborn mice raised in all daylight condition. Interestingly, disruption in circadian rhythm in pregnant mice also resulted in delayed enamel development in their babies. Treatment with melatonin receptor antagonist 4P-PDOT in pregnant mice caused underexpression of MTs and AMELX associated with long-lasting deficiency in baby enamel tissue. Electromicroscopic evidence demonstrated increased necrosis and poor enamel mineralization in ameloblasts. The above results suggest that circadian rhythm is important for normal enamel development at both pre- and postnatal stages. Melatonin receptors were partly responsible for the regulation.

AB The estimation of population parameters using complex survey data requires careful statistical modelling to account for the design features. This is further complicated by unit and item nonresponse for which a number of methods have been developed in order to reduce estimation bias. In this paper, we address some issues that arise when the target of the inference (i.e. the analysis model or model of interest) is the conditional quantile of a continuous outcome. Survey design variables are duly included in the analysis and a bootstrap variance estimation approach is proposed. Missing data are multiply imputed by means of chained equations. In particular, imputation of continuous variables is based on their empirical distribution, conditional on all other variables in the analysis. This method preserves the distributional relationships in the data, including conditional skewness and kurtosis, and successfully handles bounded outcomes. Our motivating study concerns the analysis of birthweight determinants in a large UK-based cohort of children. A novel finding on the parental conflict theory is reported. R code implementing these procedures is provided.

DE Zika virus; Olympic Games; IOC; Rio 2016
AB There is an ongoing discussion in the media about the Zika virus and the question of whether or not athletes and visitors will be at risk of an infection during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. According to an assessment published on 31 May 2016 by the IOC and the WHO, participants and visitors have no reason to panic. However, increasing public pressure has caused the WHO to re-evaluate the current situation, and further recommendations will likely be given before the Olympic Games start. The current facts are as follows: 1) The Olympic Summer Games will be held during the winter months in Brazil, when the appearance of mosquitoes is expected to be low. 2) Extensive use of insecticides every 6 to 8 weeks in Rio de Janeiro and all Olympic venues has almost eradicated the mosquito population. 3) Individual protection of athletes, trainers and visitors is crucial (wearing appropriate clothing with skin coverage, sleeping under mosquito nets, using contact insecticides for clothing and mosquito nets, and applying insect repellents on a regular basis). 4) Pregnant women should avoid travelling to any country with current Zika virus activity. In sum, the risk to incur a Zika virus infection during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro will likely be comparable to the risk in other countries where cases of Zika virus infections are registered.

AB Many studies have shown that shorter sleep duration in childhood is associated with higher body mass index (BMI), and have proposed that it is due to an effect of sleep on adiposity. There is little evidence about the association of sleep with fat-free mass. This study examined the association between child's sleep duration at age 3 years and fat and fat-free mass at 4 years of age in a prospective cohort study of 302 boys and 285 girls. Study participants were taking part in the Southampton Women's Survey, a longitudinal study of mothers and children from preconception onwards. Total sleep duration at age 3 years was derived from parental report of night sleep and nap duration. Body composition was assessed by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at 4 years. Mean total sleep duration was 11.5 hours. In linear regression analyses, adjusted for potentially confounding factors (maternal educational attainment, prepregnancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy, child's gestational age at birth, age at DXA, sex, age last breastfed, dietary quality at 3 years, TV watching and hours actively on the move and parental social class), shorter sleep in hours was associated with higher BMI (kg/m(2)) [beta: -0.2340, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.373 to -0.096], a greater fat mass index (kg) (beta: -0.1182, 95% CI: -0.218 to -0.018) and a greater fat-free mass index (kg) (beta: -0.100, 95% CI: -0.185 to -0.015). Previous research suggested that the association between shorter sleep and higher body mass index is due to an effect on adiposity. Our findings are novel, suggesting that the relationship between sleep and BMI is also determined by an effect on muscle.

AB The influence of sleep restriction (SR) during pregnancy on blood pressure and renal function among female adult offspring was investigated. Pregnant Wistar rats were distributed into control and SR groups. The SR was performed between the 14th and 20th days of pregnancy (multiple platforms method for 20h/day). At 2months of age, half of the offspring from both groups were subjected to an ovariectomy (ovx), and the other half underwent sham surgery. The groups were as follows: control sham (C-sham), control ovx (C-ovx), SR sham (SRsham), and SR ovx (SRovx). Renal function markers andsystolic blood pressure (BPi, indirect method) were evaluated at 4, 6, and 8months. Subsequently, the rats were euthanized, kidneys were removed, and processed for morphological analyses of glomerular area (GA), number of glomeruli per mm(3) (NG), and kidney mass (KM). Increased BPi was observed in the C-ovx, SRsham, and SRovx groups compared to C-sham at all ages. Increased plasma creatinine concentration and decreased creatinine clearance were observed in the SRsham and SRovx groups compared to the C-sham and C-ovx groups. The SRovx group showed higher BPi and reduced creatinine clearance compared to all other groups. The SRovx group showed reduced values of GA and KM, as well as increased NG, macrophage infiltration, collagen deposit, and ACE1 expression at the renal cortex. Therefore, SR during pregnancy might be an additional risk factor for developing renal dysfunction and increasing BP in female adult offspring. The absence of female hormones exacerbates the changes caused by SR.

AB The current study prospectively examined the ways in which goodness of fit between maternal and infant sleep contributes to maternal depressive symptoms and the mother child relationship across the first years of life. In a sample of 173 mother-child dyads, maternal prenatal sleep, infant sleep, maternal depressive symptoms, and mother-child attachment security were assessed via self-report, actigraphy, and observational measures. Results suggested that a poor fit between mothers' prenatal sleep and infants' sleep at 8 months (measured by sleep diary and actigraphy) was associated with maternal depressive symptoms at 15 months. Additionally, maternal depression mediated the association between the interplay of mother and infant sleep (measured by sleep diary) and mother child attachment security at 30 months. Findings emphasize the importance of the match between mother and infant sleep on maternal wellbeing and mother-child relationships and highlight the role of mothers' perceptions of infant sleep.

AB Objective: We aimed to determine whether in utero exposure to smoking may influence the activity and dynamics of cardiac autonomic control in preterm infants. We hypothesized that cardiac autonomic control is altered in preterm infants exposed prenatally to smoking and that these effects may vary as a function of the sleep state. Methods: We studied healthy, preterm neonates born to mothers who had smoked throughout pregnancy but not since birth (n = 16). In utero-exposed neonates were matched with control preterm neonates born to non-smoking mothers (n = 18). Cardiac autonomic control was monitored as a function of the sleep state by assessing heart rate variability with both linear and non-linear methods. Results: Preterm neonates with in utero exposure to smoking displayed alterations (relative to control neonates) in short-term cardiac autonomic control in all sleep states. These alterations included low vagal activity, elevated sympathetic activity, and low complexity and adaptability in heart rate control dynamics. Conclusions: Our results constitute direct evidence that cardiac autonomic activity and control are altered in sleeping preterm infants exposed to smoking in utero. Significance: These alterations may place the affected infants at a higher risk of neurological and cardiovascular complications, which could conceivably persist throughout childhood and adulthood.

AB Abnormalities of sleep and biological rhythms have been widely implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). However, less is known about the influence of biological rhythm disruptions across the perinatal period on postpartum depression (PPD). The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the relationship between subjective changes in both sleep and biological rhythms and worsening of depressive symptoms from pregnancy to the postpartum period in women with and without mood disorders. Eighty-three participants (38 euthymic women with a history of a mood disorder and 45 healthy controls) were studied. Participants completed subjective assessments of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), biological rhythm disturbances (Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry), and depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) prospectively at two time points: third trimester of pregnancy and at 6-12 weeks postpartum. Multivariate regression analyses showed that changes in biological rhythms across the perinatal period predicted worsening of depressive symptoms in both groups. Moreover, women with a history of a mood disorder showed higher levels of sleep and biological rhythm disruption during both pregnancy and the postpartum period. These findings suggest that disruptions in biological rhythms during the perinatal period increase the risk for postpartum mood worsening in healthy pregnant as well as in pregnant women with a history of mood disorders.

AB Objective It is unclear whether objectively measured maternal sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) leads to poor fetal outcomes. In this study, we prospectively assessed whether polysomnography-based diagnosis of SDB in the third trimester is associated with the delivery of small for gestational age (SGA) infants.
   Study design Participants were recruited from a multicentre pregnancy cohort study. Eligible participants were evaluated for SDB based on symptoms (snoring and/or witnessed apnoeas assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire) and in-home complete polysomnography in the third trimester. SGA was defined as < 10th centile using customised birthweight centiles adjusted for maternal parity, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, gestational age and infant sex.
   Results Of the 234 pregnant participants who completed a sleep study, 82% were Caucasian, with mean (SD) age of 31 (4.3) years and a prepregnancy BMI of 23 (4) kg/m(2). The delivery of SGA infants occurred in 27 (12%) of the study participants. The symptoms of SDB had poor overall sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing SDB identified by polysomnography. Symptoms of SDB in the third trimester demonstrated a potential association with delivering an SGA infant, however this did not reach statistical significance (OR 2.36 (95% CI 0.85 to 6.54, p=0.10)). However, the odds of delivering an SGA infant were significantly increased with polysomnography-based diagnosis of maternal SDB (using apnoea-hypopnoea index cut-off of 10, OR 2.65 (95% CI 1.15 to 6.10, p=0.02)).
   Conclusions Objectively measured SDB in the third trimester is significantly associated with the delivery of SGA infants.

AB Background Previous research has examined the number and extent of medicines taking in pregnant women but not their beliefs and risk perception surrounding their use. Objective To describe beliefs and risk perception associated with medicines use for the treatment of common acute conditions among UK women and explore whether this is related to actual medicines use. Settings Cross-sectional, web-based study in the UK. Methods Pregnant women and mothers within 1 year of giving birth were invited to participate in an online cross-sectional questionnaire-based study via a pregnancy website in the UK. Anonymous data were collected from women regarding their use of medicines (both over-the-counter and prescribed) and their beliefs regarding medicines use during pregnancy. Main outcome measures Pregnant women's beliefs about medicines and their relation to pharmacological treatment of acute conditions in pregnancy. Results Pharmacological treatment of conditions in pregnancy ranged from 65.4 % for urinary tract infections (UTIs) to 1.1 % for sleeping problems. Almost three out of ten women avoided using some medications during pregnancy. For heartburn and UTIs, women who did not treat the condition viewed medicines in general as being overused, more harmful and less beneficial, than those who treated the condition. In general, UK pregnant women perceived medicines to be beneficial and slightly overused. Conclusions Women's beliefs about medications impact on treatment of specific conditions in pregnancy such as heartburn and UTIs. Healthcare professionals should explore patient's beliefs regarding medication at the first maternity care visit to promote appropriate medication use in pregnancy.

AB Many controllable factors negatively impact fetal development, underscoring the importance of early pregnancy detection and identification of events that reliably predict potential complications. Clinically, core body temperature (CBT) is used to aid family planning and pregnancy detection. However, such temperature data typically are gathered in single, daily measurements. In animal studies, interventions or cell/tissue harvesting at defined stages of fetal development are arduous, requiring timed mating by trained observers. The value of continuous temperature measurements remains largely unexplored, but the advent of small, inexpensive, and increasingly ubiquitous, accurate sensor devices makes continuous measures feasible. Here, using a mouse model, we show that continuous, 1-min resolution CBT measurements reliably allow for the earliest and most accurate detection of pregnancy (100%, within 14 h of initial pairing), without requiring interaction with the animal for data collection. This method also reveals a subset of females that exhibit a pregnancylike response following pairing that persists for a variable number of days. Application of wavelet analysis that permits frequency analysis while preserving temporal resolution, uncovers significant differences in ultradian frequencies of CBT; these rhythms are significantly increased in the 12 h after the day of pairing for pregnancies carried to term compared to apparent pregnancies that failed. High temporal resolution CBT and wavelet analysis permit strikingly early detection and separation of successful pregnancies and pregnancy-like events.

TI Sleeping patterns of Swedish women experiencing a stillbirth between
   2000-2014-an observational study
SO BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Pregnancy; Sleeping position; Stillbirth
AB Background: External (to the fetus) stressors may act together with maternal factors as well as fetal and placental factors to increase the risk of stillbirth. Data published in 2011 indicate non-left side sleeping positions, particularly the supine one, is such a stressor; we do not know, however, if this new knowledge has influenced the choice of sleeping position among pregnant women.
   Methods: Using a web-based questionnaire made available at the home page of the Swedish national infant foundation we collected information on sleeping positions among women who gave birth to a stillborn baby between 2000 and 2014.
   Results: The questionnaire was completed by 583 women. About one third of the women reporting their sleeping position stated that they lay down on their the left side when going to bed, and another third reported lying down as often on the left as on the right side. Figures for typically going to bed on the left side the 4 weeks preceding the stillbirth was as follows: 72 (30 %) of 242 between 2011 and 2014 and 86 (27 %) of 313 between 2000 and 2010. Among the 240 women who remembered their position when waking up on the day the stillbirth was diagnosed, 63 (26 %) reported a supine position.
   Conclusion: Our data indicate that one third of the women went to bed on the left side the month before the stillbirth. The data are consistent with the notion that efforts in Sweden to advise women to lie on their left side when going to bed may decrease the rate of stillbirth.

ID INSECTICIDE TREATED NETS; PREGNANT-WOMEN; CHILDREN; YAOUNDE
AB Background: In Cameroon, malaria continues to be endemic and the first major cause of morbidity and mortality among the most vulnerable groups-children under 5 years of age, pregnant women, people living with HIV/AIDS and the poor. The use of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) is one of the recommended measures to prevent malaria. The present study was aimed at accessing the acceptability and effective use of LLINs on the prevalence of malaria in PMI Nkwen, Bambui and its environs.
   Methods: Hospital-based diagnosis consisted of 476 blood samples that were screened using the rapid diagnostic kits to determine the prevalence of malaria among users and non-users of LLINs. A structured questionnaire was also administered to pregnant women and children less than 5 years of age (476 hospital-based and 350 from the community) which consisted of demographic information, availability, accessibility affordability, acceptability, effective use and problems encountered with the use of LLINs.
   Results: Result obtained showed that out of the 476 hospital-based patients, 29 tested positive for malaria giving an overall prevalence of 6.09 %. Equally, results of the questionnaire showed that 743 (89.9 %) of the respondents owned LLINs with up to 649 (87.3 %) having been given to them free-of-charge, and that 578 (77.8 %) were using their LLINs to sleep, even though 18.2 % of the respondents used their LLINs for other purposes, such as fishing, nursing seeds and footfall nets. Malaria was minimal among users of LLINs than non-users and the results were significant at P <= 0.05. Also 71.9 % of the respondents said that their nets were in good condition while 52.2 % of them said the major problem with the usage of LLINs was heat and the feeling of suffocation.
   Conclusion: These results indicate that LLINs have significantly reduced the prevalence of malaria among the studied population, and so the government should not relent its efforts in the distribution of these nets especially to the vulnerable groups in order eliminate malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases. Utilization of LLINs needs to be encouraged to match ownership, while free distribution of ITNs to vulnerable groups needs to be continuous and consistent.

AB Alterations to the supply of oxygen during early life presents a profound stressor to physiological systems with aberrant remodeling that is often long-lasting. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CH) is a feature of apnea of prematurity, chronic lung disease, and sleep apnea. CIH affects respiratory control but there is a dearth of information concerning the effects of CIH on respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm the major pump muscle of breathing. We investigated the effects of exposure to gestational CIH (gCIH) and postnatal CIH (pCIH) on diaphragm muscle function in male and female rats. CIH consisted of exposure in environmental chambers to 90s of hypoxia reaching 5% O-2 at nadir, once every 5 min, 8 h a day. Exposure to gCIH started within 24 h of identification of a copulation plug and continued until day 20 of gestation; animals were studied on postnatal day 22 or 42. For pCIH, pups were born in normoxia and within 24 h of delivery were exposed with dams to CIH for 3 weeks; animals were studied on postnatal day 22 or 42. Sham groups were exposed to normoxia in parallel. Following gas exposures, diaphragm muscle contractile, and endurance properties were examined ex vivo. Neither gCIH nor pCIH exposure had effects on diaphragm muscle force-generating capacity or endurance in either sex. Similarly, early life exposure to CIH did not affect muscle tolerance of severe hypoxic stress determined ex vivo. The findings contrast with our recent observation of upper airway dilator muscle weakness following exposure to pCIH. Thus, the present study suggests a relative resilience to hypoxic stress in diaphragm muscle. Co-ordinated activity of thoracic pump and upper airway dilator muscles is required for optimal control of upper airway caliber. A mismatch in the force-generating capacity of the complementary muscle groups could have adverse consequences for the control of airway patency and respiratory homeostasis.

AB Background: In Uganda, the Government has promoted the use of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) and insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) as malaria control strategies for pregnant women. However, their utilization among pregnant women is low. This study aimed at assessing factors associated with use of IPTp for malaria and ITNs by pregnant women in Buwunga sub-county, Bugiri District.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, conducted in Buwunga sub-county, Bugiri District, employing quantitative data collection tools. A total of 350 household members were randomly selected to participate in the study. Data were entered and analysed using Epi info version 3.5.1; bivariable and multivariable analysis was done to assess the factors associated with use of IPTp and ITNs among pregnant women.
   Results: The level of uptake of IPTp1 (at least one dose) was 63.7 % while IPTp2 (at least two doses) was 42.0 %. More than half (58.6 %) of the mothers had slept under an ITN the night before the survey. Slightly more than half (51.9 %) of the mothers mentioned stock outs as the major reason for not accessing IPTp and ITNs. The main factors that were statistically significant for IPTp2 uptake were the knowledge of mothers on IPTp2 (AOR 2.48 95 % CI 1.53-4.02) and providing women with free clean water at the antenatal care (ANC) clinic (AOR 3.63 95 % CI 2.06-6.39). Factors that were significant for ITN utilization included education level of mothers (AOR 2.03 95 % CI 1.09-3.78), ease of access (AOR 2.74 95 % CI 1.65-4.52), and parity (AOR 1.71 95 % CI 1.01-1.29).
   Conclusion: The level of uptake of the two recommended doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) tablets for malaria prevention (IPTp2) was low, slightly more than half of the mothers slept under an ITN the night before the survey. Appropriate measures to increase the level of uptake of IPTp2 and coverage of ITNs among pregnant women should be implemented, and these include providing health education about IPTp and ITNs, and ensuring that mothers are provided with free safe clean water at ANC clinic.

AB We examined previously published systematic review studies on associations between shift work and health, using the PubMed (MEDLINE) database for our literature search. We eventually selected 30 studies: 2 studies on sleep disorders, 7 on cancer, 7 on metabolic endocrine disorders, 7 on reproduction, 4 on cardiovascular disease, 1 on gastrointestinal disorders, and 2 on the types of shift work and health-related outcomes. Meta-analyses based on quantitative combination of the data from these studies showed that shift work significantly increased the risk of the following disorders: breast cancer, diabetes mellitus, preterm delivery, abortion, low birth weight, small-for-gestational-age infants, menstrual disruption, infertility, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke. Some previous studies had also reported significantly increased risks of sleep disturbance, prostate cancer, body weight change, metabolic syndrome, and fertility and gastrointestinal disorders. Some studies had gathered substantial data, including those obtained from meta-analyses, which indicated significant associations. In contrast, other studies were unable to present sufficient evidence because of the smaller number of data sets included. Therefore, based on these findings, further accumulation of epidemiological studies on this theme is warranted.

AB Sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy. Insomnia is a frequent sleep disturbance experienced by pregnant women which can be primary or due to co-morbid conditions. The differential diagnosis of insomnia in pregnancy includes anxiety disorders, mood disorders, breathing related sleep disorders and restless legs syndrome. Early interventions to treat the sleep disturbance are recommended to avoid adverse pregnancy outcomes. Management strategies include improving sleep hygiene, behavioral therapies, and pharmacotherapy. The risks of pharmacotherapy must be weighed against their benefits due to the possible risk of teratogenicity associated with some medications.
   Methods: We searched PubMed and Google Scholar employing a combination of key words: pregnancy, sleep disturbances, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Sleep disorders and insomnia. We included original studies, review articles, meta-analysis and systematic reviews in our search prioritizing articles from the last 10-15 years. Articles older than 15 years were only included if their findings had not been superseded by more recent data. Further selection of articles was done from bibliographies and references of selected articles.
   Conclusion: Sleep disturbances in pregnancy are common and cause considerable morbidity. Management includes a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments carefully weighing the risks and benefits of each for the expectant mother and fetus.

   PREVALENCE; MOTHERS; RISK
AB Purpose: To study the epileptiform discharges (EDs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of 6-8-year-old children of women with epilepsy (WWE). Materials and Methods: All children born to women with epilepsy and prospectively followed up through the Kerala Registry of Epilepsy and Pregnancy (KREP), aged 6-8 years, were invited (n = 532). Out of the 254 children who responded, clinical evaluations and a 30-min digital 18 channel EEG were completed in 185 children. Results: Of the 185 children examined, 37 (20%) children (19 males, 18 females) had ED in their EEG. The EDs were generalized in 7 children, and focal in 30 children. The EDs were present in the sleep record only of 16 (43%) children and in the awake record only of 6 (16%) children. Out of the 94 children for whom seizure history was available, 7 children (7.4%) had seizures (neonatal seizures: 4, febrile seizure: 1, and single nonfebrile seizure: 2) and none had history of epilepsy or recurrent nonfebrile seizures. The odds ratio (OR) for occurrence of ED in the EEG was significantly higher for children of WWE [OR = 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-6.0] when compared to the published data for age-matched children of mothers without epilepsy. There was no association between the occurrence of ED and the children's maternal characteristics [epilepsy syndrome, seizures during pregnancy, maternal intelligence quotient (IQ)] or the children's characteristics [antenatal exposure to specific antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), birth weight, malformations, IQ]. Conclusion: Children of WWE have a higher risk of epileptiform activity in their EEG when compared to healthy children in the community though none had recurrent seizures.

TI Targeted Pressure on Abductor Hallucis and Flexor Hallucis Brevis
   Muscles to Manage Moderate to Severe Primary Restless Legs Syndrome
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN OSTEOPATHIC ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID DOUBLE-BLIND; ROPINIROLE; AUGMENTATION; DIAGNOSIS; DOPAMINE; 12-WEEK
AB Context: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) treatments have included medications with many adverse effects and limited utility. A noninvasive device would potentially have extensive use where RLS medications may not be appropriate, such as in pregnant or breastfeeding women, people with mild RLS, people who operate machinery or drive occupationally, people with severely impaired renal function, or people who are taking medications contraindicated with RLS medications.
   Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of a device that produces targeted pressure on the abductor hallucis and the flexor hallucis brevis muscles to reduce the symptoms of moderate to severe RLS, and to compare the current findings with findings from studies of ropinirole use in patients with primary RLS.
   Methods: This 8-week single-arm, open-label, clinical trial with a repeated measures design was conducted between April 2009 and August 2012 in 2 offices in Erie, Pennsylvania. Adults with moderate to severe primary RLS were recruited for the study. Mean (SD) follow-up was 15.6 (6) months. Patients wore RLS devices (1 on each foot) for set periods intermittently throughout the course of the study. The primary end point was mean change in the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) Rating Scale from baseline to day 56, and the secondary measure was the Clinical Global Impression scale. A meta-analysis was used to compare the RLS device findings with the findings of 3 historic studies of ropinirole vs placebo. The demographics, disease severity, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assessment tools were similar among the 4 studies.
   Results: Thirty patients (22 women, 8 men; mean age, 51.5 years [range, 30-75 years]) participated in the study. Change in mean (SD) IRLSSG score was significantly greater for the RLS device (17.22 [6.16]; P<.001) compared with the ropinirole vs placebo findings (12 [0.86] vs 8.9 [0.86], respectively; P<.05). Sleep loss significantly decreased from 119.5 (61.6) minutes to 22.1 (31.1) minutes per night (P<.001). Global Improvement Scale scores indicated significantly greater improvement with the RLS device compared with ropinirole (27 of 30 [90%] vs 293 of 464 [63%], respectively; P<.05). Mild, transient adverse effects of the device (eg, pain, paresthesia) were reported, but these effects were relieved by loosening the straps. The RLS device demonstrated none of the adverse effects associated with current dopamine agonist therapy, such as augmentation, tolerance, rebound, somnolence, and nausea.
   Conclusion: Producing targeted pressure on the abductor hallucis and flexor hallucis brevis muscles with an external RLS device reduced the symptoms of moderate to severe primary RLS without the adverse effects of medication therapy. (ClinicalTrials.govnumber NCT02386423.)

AB Decreased oxygenation during pregnancy and early periods of ontogeny can affect normal body development and result in diseases in adulthood. The aim of this study was to use the model of prenatal intermittent hypoxia (PIH) and evaluate the effects of short-term hypoxia at the end of gestation on blood pressure (BP) control in adulthood. Wistar rats were exposed daily to PIH for 4 h during gestational day 19 and 20. In adult male rats, heart rate (HR), systolic BP and pulse pressure (PP) were acquired by radiotelemetry during 1 week. On the basis of HR variability and BP variability, sympathovagal balance (LF/HF) and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sBRS) were evaluated. Systolic BP and PP were significantly elevated in PIH rats in comparison with control rats during the light and dark phase of the day, while LF/HF increased only during the light phase of the day. In contrast, sBRS tended to decrease only during the dark phase in PIH rats. In all measured and calculated parameters, significant circadian rhythms were present and were not affected by PIH. In conclusion, our data suggest that short intermittent hypoxia at the end of gestation can increase BP and PP via significant changes in LF/HF, which occur especially during the passive phase of the day. Results suggest that minor changes in the autonomous nervous system activity induced by environmental conditions during the perinatal period may contribute to development of hypertension in adulthood.

AB BACKGROUND: Smoking tobacco increases the risk of respiratory disease in adults and children, but communicating the magnitude of these effects in a scientific manner that is accessible and usable by the public and policymakers presents a challenge. We have therefore summarized scientific data on the impact of smoking on respiratory diseases to provide the content for a unique resource, SmokeHaz.
   METHODS: We conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses of longitudinal studies (published to 2013) identified from electronic databases, gray literature, and experts. Random effect meta-analyses were used to pool the findings.
   RESULTS: We included 216 articles. Among adult smokers, we confirmed substantially increased risks of lung cancer (risk ratio (RR), 10.92; 95% CI, 8.28-14.40; 34 studies), COPD (RR, 4.01; 95% CI, 3.18-5.05; 22 studies), and asthma (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.07-2.42; eight studies). Exposure to passive smoke significantly increased the risk of lung cancer in adult nonsmokers and increased the risks of asthma, wheeze, lower respiratory infections, and reduced lung function in children. Smoking significantly increased the risk of sleep apnea and asthma exacerbations in adult and pregnant populations, and active and passive smoking increased the risk of tuberculosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings have been translated into easily digestible content and published on the SmokeHaz website.

AB BACKGROUND: Periodic breathing (PB) is a normal immature breathing pattern in neonates that, if extreme, may be associated with pathologic conditions.
   METHODS: We used our automated PB detection system to analyze all bedside monitor chest impedance data on all infants <35 wk' gestation in the University of Virginia Neonatal Intensive Care Unit from 2009-2014 (n = 1,211). Percent time spent in PB was calculated hourly (>50 infant-years' data). Extreme PB was identified as a 12-h period with PB >6 SDs above the mean for gestational age (GA) and postmenstrual age and >10% time in PB.
   RESULTS: PB increased with GA, with the highest amount in infants 30-33 wk' GA at about 2 wk' chronologic age. Extreme PB was identified in 76 infants and in 45% was temporally associated with clinical events including infection or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), immunizations, or caffeine discontinuation. In 8 out of 28 cases of septicemia and 10 out of 21 cases of NEC, there was a >2-fold increase in %PB over baseline on the day prior to diagnosis.
   CONCLUSION: Infants <35 wk GA spend, on average, <6% of the time in PB. An acute increase in PB may reflect illness or physiological stressors or may occur without any apparent clinical event.

AB The perinatal period introduces a myriad of changes. One important but often overlooked change is an increased reporting of sleep disturbance. Although casually regarded as a consequence of pregnancy or postpartum, there is emerging evidence implicating significant sleep disturbance, characterized by insomnia symptoms and/or poor sleep quality, with adverse outcomes, such as an increase in depressive symptomatology or the development postpartum depression (PPD). Significant consequences may arise as a result including issues with maternal-infant bonding, effective care for the infant, and behavioral or emotional difficulties in the infant. This review discusses the relevant literature as to how disturbed sleep during pregnancy as well as in the postpartum may increase the risk for PPD.

AB Background: Long-term adverse effects of propranolol treatment for infantile hemangioma (IH) in young children have been suggested.
   Objective: To compare growth and development in children treated with propranolol for IH with nontreated healthy controls.
   Methods: Eighty two (73%) children with IH aged 43 to 51 months treated with propranolol for 6 months or longer, and without other developmental risk factors, were recruited (cases) and matched with 4 twin counterparts and 78 children from a community-based cohort (control subjects). Parents completed the 48-months Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ). Percentages of children with abnormal ASQ results were compared using chi(2) analyses. Mean ASQ scores and growth were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests.
   Results: Six (7.3%) cases had abnormal ASQ results, compared with 10 (12.2%) controls (P = .292). Mean ASQ total score (25th-75th percentile) was 52.9 (50.8-57.0) for cases and 51.9 (49.0-56.0) for controls (P = .383). Height and weight of cases and controls were comparable.
   Limitations: A parent-completed screening instrument was used. The exclusion of children born at gestational age less than 36 weeks and/or children born small for gestational age partly limits generalizability.
   Conclusion: We found no increased developmental risk or growth impairment at age 4 years in patients with IH treated with propranolol.

AB Background: We have previously shown that high fat (HF) feeding during pregnancy primes the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatits (NASH) in the adult offspring. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear.
   Aims: Since the endogenous molecular clock can regulate hepatic lipid metabolism, we investigated whether exposure to a HF diet during development could alter hepatic clock gene expression and contribute to NASH onset in later life.
   Methods: Female mice were fed either a control (C, 7% kcal fat) or HF (45% kcal fat) diet. Offspring were fed either a C or HF diet resulting in four offspring groups: C/C, C/HF, HF/C and HF/HF. NAFLD progression, cellular redox status, sirtuin expression (Sirtl, Sirt3), and the expression of core clock genes (Clock, Bmall, Pert, Cry2) and clock-controlled genes involved in lipid metabolism (Rev-Erbce, Rev-ErbA, RORa, and Srebplc) were measured in offspring livers.
   Results: Offspring fed a HF diet developed NAFLD. However HF fed offspring of mothers fed a HF diet developed NASH, coupled with significantly reduced NAD /NADH (p < 0.05, HF/HF vs C/C), Sirtl (p < 0.001, HF/HF vs C/C), Sirt3 (p < 0.01, HF/HF vs C/C), perturbed clock gene expression, and elevated expression of genes involved lipid metabolism, such as Srebplc (p < 0.05, C/HF and HF/HF vs C/C).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that exposure to excess dietary fat during early and post-natal life increases the susceptibility to develop NASH in adulthood, involving altered cellular redox status, reduced sirtuin abundance, and desynchronized clock gene expression.

AB Background: Lead is a pervasive neurotoxicant that has been associated with poorer cognitive, behavioral, and motor outcomes in children. The effects of lead on sensory function have not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of prenatal lead exposure on infant sensory function, as measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and grating visual acuity (VA).
   Methods: Lead was measured in maternal blood in mid- and late-pregnancy (mean gestational age = 15.5 and 39. 0 weeks, respectively) and umbilical cord blood in a cohort of full-term infants in rural northeastern China. ABR latencies (peaks I, III, V) were measured in newborns during unsedated sleep (n = 315). The ABR central-to-peripheral (C-P) ratio was calculated as the ratio between the III-V and I-III interpeak intervals. VA was measured in 6-week-olds using Teller Acuity Cards (n = 1019) and assigned as the narrowest grid the infant fixated on. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate relationships between tertiles of mid-pregnancy, late-pregnancy, or cord lead and newborn ABR or 6-week VA.
   Results: Higher late-pregnancy lead levels were associated with higher ABR C-P ratios and lower VA. In covariate-adjusted analyses, mean C-P ratios were 4.6 and 3.2 % higher in infants whose mothers had lead > 3. 8 mu g/dL and lead = 2-3.8 mu g/dL, respectively, than for infants whose mothers had lead < 2 mu g/dL (p-trend = 0.002). In adjusted analyses for VA, mean scores were 8.5 and 7.2 % lower for maternal lead > 3.8 mu g/dL and lead = 2-3. 8 mu g/dL, respectively, compared to lead < 2 mu g/dL (p-trend = 0.009).
   Conclusion: Auditory and visual systems maturation appears delayed in infants with higher prenatal lead exposure during late-pregnancy, even at relatively low levels. Both systems start myelinating in late gestation and mature rapidly in infancy. Higher ABR C-P ratio and lower grating VA scores suggest effects of low-level lead exposure on sensory system myelination.

ID WESTERN KENYA; MALARIA CONTROL; CHILDREN; POSSESSION; OWNERSHIP;

AB Background: Uganda conducted an LLIN mass distribution campaign in 2013 with the goal of achieving universal coverage. Using data from the 2014 malaria indicator survey, this analysis estimated the proportion of the population with access to an LLIN that slept under one the night before the survey and factors associated with not using an LLIN in households that had achieved universal coverage.
   Methods: This was a secondary data analysis using the 2014 malaria indicator survey dataset. The outcome was use of an LLIN among households that achieved universal coverage, while independent variables include age, gender, number of household members, residence, number of sleeping rooms, spraying of rooms with insecticide, number of children under 5 years of age, number of women of child-bearing age, relationship structure and community distribution of ant-malarial medicine.
   Results: Overall, 3361 (62 %) households of the 5345 achieved universal coverage and were included in the analysis giving a total population of 14,450 individuals. Of these, 11,884 (80.10 %) reported to have slept under an LLIN the night before the survey. Children between 6 and 14 years were significantly less likely to use an LLIN when compared to those under 5 years (75.26 vs 83.12 %), [adjusted OR, 1.29 (1.11-1.49), p = 0.001]. The odds of not using an LLIN, significantly increased from households with five members when compared to those that had one member (79.53 vs 84.88 %), [adjusted OR, 2.16 (1.38-3.38), p = 0.001] and rising even further in households with six or more members (78.04 vs 84.88 %), [OR, 2.27 (1.36-3.71), p = 0.003].
   Conclusions: This analysis has showed that 80 % of the population used an LLIN among households that achieved universal coverage following the 2013 mass distribution campaign, especially among children under 5 years, an operational success in this category. However, children between 6 and 14 years and individuals from households with five or more numbers are less likely to use the LLINs. In order to improve usage in these categories, it may require re-focusing the behaviour change communication message to be all-inclusive, especially in era of universal coverage, and to increase the number of LLINs distributed in households with more than four members during future mass distribution campaigns, respectively.

AB Background: Postpartum depression is a common condition, which consequences might be harmful for both mother and child. Since sleep and depression are closely related it is possible that women who suffer from sleep related problems during pregnancy are more likely to develop depression in the postpartum period. This study aims to investigate the possible association between depressive symptoms in the postpartum period and sleep related problems during pregnancy.
   Methods: In this study 293 women in the last trimester of pregnancy answered a questionnaire about symptoms of restless legs, snoring and daytime sleepiness. They also completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The same women were screened for depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) four to ten weeks after giving birth. Additional information about social data, pregnancy and delivery was received from the medical charts.
   Results: Women with postpartum depressive symptoms had higher prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness defined as ESS score >= 10 (OR 3.84, CI 1.57-9.39), and restless legs syndrome (OR 2.837 CI 1.18-6.84) in last trimester of pregnancy, when adjusted for socio-demographic factors and obstetric risk factors. No association was found between postpartum depressive symptoms and snoring.
   Conclusions: Depressive symptoms after childbirth are preceded by sleep related problems such as daytime sleepiness and restless legs, already during pregnancy. The results from Epworth Sleepiness Scale and a questionnaire concerning Restless Legs Syndrome completed during pregnancy might be a valuable contribution for detecting women at risk for postpartum depression, enabling preventive interventions.

AB Patent foramen ovale (PFO)-related stroke is increasingly recognized as an important etiology of ischemic embolic stroke-accounting for up to 50% of strokes previously considered 'cryptogenic' or with an unknown mechanism. As a 'back door to the brain,' PFO can allow venous clots to enter arterial circulation via interatrial right-to-left shunting, potentially resulting in ischemic stroke. We observe that clinically, PFO-related stroke affects women of childbearing age, and that pregnancy-owing to major changes in hemocoagulative, hormonal, and cardiovascular parameters-can enhance stroke risks. However, no systematic study has been performed and little is known regarding complications, pregnancy outcomes and treatment for PFO-related stroke during pregnancy. To identify and characterize the complications and clinical outcomes related to PFOs during pregnancy, we performed a literature review and analysis from all reported cases of pregnancy with PFO-related complications in the medical literature from 1970 to 2015. We find that during pregnancy and postpartum, PFO is associated with complications affecting multiple organs, including the brain, heart and lung. The three principal complications reported are stroke, pulmonary emboli and myocardial infarction. In contrast to other pregnancy-related stroke etiologies, which peak during later pregnancy and postpartum, PFO-related stroke peaks during early pregnancy (first and second trimester-60%), and most patients had good neurological outcome (77%). In patients with PFO with recurrent stroke during pregnancy, additional key factors include high-risk PFO morphology (atrial septal aneurysm), larger right-to-left shunt, multiple gestation and concurrent hypercoagulability. Compared to strokes of other etiologies during pregnancy, most PFO stroke patients experienced uneventful delivery (93%) of healthy babies with a good clinical outcome. We conclude with recommended clinical treatment strategies for pregnant patients with PFO suggested by the data from these cases, and the clinical experience of our Cardio-Neurology Clinic.

AB Background: Sleep disturbance, depression, and daytime sleepiness are among the most prevalent symptoms reported by women during pregnancy. However, available data on the association between sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness in pregnant women are sparse and methodological limitations have been acknowledged. The purpose of the study was to examine objective and self-reported sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness in a group of healthy pregnant women. Methods: A total of 274 third-trimester pregnant women wore a wrist actigraph continuously for 7 days to assess objective sleep quality and quantity. Self-reported sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), with self-reported poor sleep quality defined as a PSQI score more than 5. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale were used to evaluate symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness, respectively. Results: Sixty-four (23.4%) women were at risk for clinical depression and 69 (25.2%) had daytime sleepiness. Risk of clinically meaningful depressive symptomatology was significantly increased in women with objective total nighttime sleep less than 6 hours (OR 2.53 [95% CI 1.26-5.08]) and self-reported poor sleep quality (OR 3.31 [95% CI 1.74-6.30]), even after multiple adjustment. Neither objective nor self-reported sleep disturbances increased daytime sleepiness in this group of pregnant women. Discussion: Both objective nighttime sleep less than 6 hours and self-reported poor sleep quality in healthy third-trimester pregnant women is associated with significant risks for clinical depression. Improving sleep would likely be associated with a reduction in depression symptom severity and an attenuation of the prevalence of depression in pregnant women. (BIRTH 43: 2 June 2016)

AB Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) occurs in 0.6% to 15% of reproductive aged women. Because of an overlap in symptoms of SDB and normal pregnancy findings, the diagnosis of SDB in pregnancy is challenging. The repetitive arousals, sleep fragmentation, and hypoxias experienced by patients with SDB lead to an increase in oxidative stress and inflammation. In the nonpregnant population, SDB is associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and stroke. Increasing evidence identifies an association between SDB in pregnancy and gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and fetal growth abnormalities.

AB Providers of obstetric and gynecologic care are often the most commonly seen medical providers for adult women, providing primary and reproductive care. Even where psychiatric care is readily available, obstetricians/gynecologists are frequently the front line for recognition, education, and initial management of many mental health problems. In settings where psychiatric treatment is a more scarce resource, obstetricians/gynecologists often are responsible for ongoing treatment of these disorders. This review focuses on the impact of the female reproductive life cycle on the presentation and management of some of the most common behavioral health problems in women: major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and primary sleep disorders.

AB Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a common retinal cause of visual loss. The mainstays of management are observation, photodynamic therapy (PDT) and laser procedures. Over the past decade, there has been rapid development in the existing and novel imaging techniques, functional testing and management of CSCR. However, there is no convincing treatment designed for CSCR yet. In recent years, the advances in PDT, with various adjustments in fluence and verteporfin dosage, and the comparisons between different types of PDT for acute and chronic CSCR in recent studies have provided greater insights into the role of PDT in treating CSCR. Novel laser procedures, such as the diode micropulse laser, have shown comparable efficacy to conventional lasers without laser-induced damage. Antivascular endothelial growth factor, which was originally developed for treating cancers, has emerged to be a potentially effective treatment for CSCR. The potential role of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in treating CSCR has provided greater understanding of the pathogenesis. Based on the relevant studies, mainly from the past decade, we discuss updates to the management of CSCR according to the risk factor modifications, pharmacological interventions, PDT and laser procedures and concluded that PDT is the current best option for CSCR.

LA English
DT Article
ID CIRCADIAN-RHYTHM; POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION; WOMEN; DISTURBANCES; MOOD;
   PATTERNS; PREVALENCE; RECURRENCE; MELATONIN; SYSTEM
AB Background: Recent research in major depressive disorder suggests that dysregulation of the circadian system may be a core pathophysiological component. In pregnancy, women often experience significant disruptions in their daily rhythms, including changes in day-to-day schedule and sleep habits. Current evidence suggests that these disruptions in daily rhythms may adversely affect underlying circadian rhythmicity. The purpose of our study was to examine whether subjectively rated daily rhythm disruptions were associated with a greater incidence of depressive symptoms during the third trimester.
   Method: Our study was a cross-sectional design, assessing sleep quality, symptoms of depression, and daily rhythm disruptions in 51 pregnant women in their third trimester.
   Results: We observed a significant relationship between mild depressive symptoms and disruptions in daily rhythms. While we initially observed a strong correlation between subjective sleep quality and depressive symptoms, this was attenuated after accounting for daily rhythm disruptions. Disruptions in daily social rhythms, eating patterns, and general activity were all significantly associated with depressive symptomatology.
   Conclusion: Our findings point to a strong correlation between daily rhythm disruptions and prenatal depressive symptoms. Given that these daily rhythms are known to act as zeitgebers, longitudinal studies examining the directionality of this relationship between circadian rhythms and depressive symptoms during pregnancy are warranted.

AB Context: Mounting evidence suggests that the origins of childhood obesity and related disparities can be found as early as the "first 1,000 days"-the period from conception to age 2 years. The main goal of this study is to systematically review existing evidence for modifiable childhood obesity risk factors present from conception to age 2 years.
   Evidence acquisition: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies published between January 1, 1980, and December 12, 2014, of childhood obesity risk factors present during the first 1,000 days. Prospective, original human subject, English-language research with exposure occurrence during the first 1,000 days and with the outcome of childhood overweight or obesity (BMI >= 85th percentile for age and sex) collected between age 6 months and 18 years were analyzed between December 13, 2014, and March 15, 2015.
   Evidence synthesis: Of 5,952 identified citations, 282 studies met inclusion criteria. Several risk factors during the first 1,000 days were consistently associated with later childhood obesity. These included higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, prenatal tobacco exposure, maternal excess gestational weight gain, high infant birth weight, and accelerated infant weight gain. Fewer studies also supported gestational diabetes, child care attendance, low strength of maternal-infant relationship, low SES, curtailed infant sleep, inappropriate bottle use, introduction of solid food intake before age 4 months, and infant antibiotic exposure as risk factors for childhood obesity.
   Conclusions: Modifiable risk factors in the first 1,000 days can inform future research and policy priorities and intervention efforts to prevent childhood obesity. (C) 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Postpartum depression (PPD) occurs in 10-15 % of women. The appetite hormone ghrelin, which fluctuates during pregnancy, is associated with depression in nonpregnant samples. Here, we examine the association between PPD and active ghrelin from pregnancy to postpartum. We additionally examine whether ghrelin changes from pregnancy to postpartum and differs between breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women. Sixty women who participated in a survey examining PPD and had information in regard to ghrelin concentrations were included in the study. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess symptoms of PPD. Raw ghrelin levels and ghrelin levels adjusted for creatinine were included as outcomes. Women screening positive for PPD at 12 weeks postpartum had higher pregnancy ghrelin concentrations. Ghrelin concentrations significantly decreased from pregnancy to 6 weeks postpartum and this change differed based on pregnancy depression status. Finally, ghrelin levels were lower in women who breastfed compared with women who were bottle-feeding. No significant findings remained once ghrelin levels were adjusted for creatinine. Although results do not suggest an association between PPD and ghrelin after adjusting for creatinine, future research should continue to explore this possibility extending further across the postpartum period with larger sample sizes.

AB Lung and kidney functions are intimately related in both health and disease. The regulation of acid-base equilibrium, modification of partial pressure of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate concentration, and the control of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis all closely depend on renal and pulmonary activities. These interactions begin in fetal age and are often responsible for the genesis and progression of diseases. In gestational age, urine is a fundamental component of the amniotic fluid, acting on pulmonary maturation and growth. Moreover, in the first trimester of pregnancy, kidney is the main source of proline, contributing to collagen synthesis and lung parenchyma maturation. Pathologically speaking, the kidneys could become damaged by mediators of inflammation or immuno-mediated factors related to a primary lung pathology or, on the contrary, it could be the renal disease that determines a consecutive pulmonary damage. Furthermore, non immunological mechanisms are frequently involved in renal and pulmonary diseases, as observed in chronic pathologies such as sleep apnea syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, progressive renal disease and hemodialysis. Kidney damage has also been related to mechanical ventilation. The aim of this review is to describe pulmonary-renal interactions and their related pathologies, underscoring the need for a close collaboration between intensivists, pneumologists and nephrologists.

ID INFANT SLEEP; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; RECOMMENDATIONS; ASSOCIATION;
   POPULATION; DEATHS
AB Aim: To explore the link between breastfeeding duration and bed-sharing frequency among women reporting a prenatal intention to breastfeed.
   Methods: About 870 participants in a randomised breastfeeding trial, recruited at mid-pregnancy, provided weekly snapshots of breastfeeding and bed-sharing behaviour for 26 weeks following birth. Strength of prenatal breastfeeding intent was recorded at recruitment using Likert-type scales.
   Results: Outcomes were frequency of bed-sharing at home for at least one hour per week, and time to cessation of breastfeeding. There were insufficient data to classify bed-sharing pattern in 192/870 (22%) of mothers. Of the remainder, 44% (299/678) of participants 'rarely' or 'never' bed-shared, 28% (192/678) did so 'intermittently' and 28% (187/678) did so 'often'. These three groups did not differ significantly in marital status, income, infant gestational age, maternal age or delivery mode. Significantly, more participants who bed-shared 'often' reported strong prenatal breastfeeding intent (70% vs. 57% and 56% for 'intermittent' and 'rare' bed-share groups) and attached high prenatal importance to breastfeeding (95% vs. 87% and 82%). Significantly, more women who bed-shared frequently were breastfeeding at 6 months (p < 0.0001) than those who intermittently or rarely/never bed-shared.
   Conclusion: Women with strong motivation to breastfeed frequently bed-share. Given the complex relationship between bed-sharing and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) appropriate guidance balancing risk minimisation with support for breastfeeding mothers is crucial.

AB Purpose of review
   This review aims to provide an update on recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during pregnancy and its effect on maternal and fetal outcomes.
   Recent findings
   Current OSA screening tools may not perform well in this population. There are some pieces of evidence linking poorer maternal and neonatal outcome with pregnant patients having OSA. At present, there are inadequate data on which to base fetal or maternal parameters for treatment of OSA, and no evidence that treatment in the short-term impacts maternal or neonatal outcomes.
   Summary
   Further research is needed to help in the detection and treatment of OSA in pregnancy.

AB Women with diabetes often experience a higher level of anxiety. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of acupressure on relieving anxiety of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A randomized clinical trial was conducted on 60 women with GDM at a university hospital. The participants were allocated to an experimental and a placebo group (30 women per group). The experimental group received a nurse-provided acupressure at the true point, and the placebo group received pressure (touching) at a sham (false) point. Anxiety was measured immediately in the groups prior to and after a 2-day intervention by a questionnaire and the Visual Analogue Scale. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results indicated that the acupressure group had significantly lower anxiety than the placebo group (p <= .0001). In conclusion, the effects of acupressure appeared to be effective in reducing anxiety in diabetic pregnant women.

TI A follow-up study to assess the determinants and consequences of

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

DE Physical activity; Pregnancy outcomes; Neonatal outcomes; Accelerometer
AB Background: In recent years, the influence of physical exercise on pregnancy outcomes has been widely debated. Despite the numerous studies addressing the relationship between maternal physical activity and pregnancy outcomes, the evidence for consistent and significant impact of regular exercise during pregnancy on fetal growth remains lacking. The aims of this study were, first, to assess the level of physical activity performed throughout the pregnancy by objective (accelerometer) and self-reported (questionnaire) measurements, and, second, to ascertain pre-pregnancy physical activity levels, to estimate the relationship between levels of physical activity and some pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.
   Methods/design: This was a prospective cohort study. Participants were pregnant women (n = 194) aged 18 to 40 years who attended for three quarterly appointments for pregnancy ultrasound scans at the Virgen de la Luz Hospital in Cuenca, Spain. All participants provided written informed consents to participate in the study. Physical activity during the pregnancy follow-up was assessed by a self-reported Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire and sleep log; also objectively by a GT3X accelerometer (ActiGraph). Furthermore, pregnancy symptoms inventory, nutritional behavioural assessment, socio-demographic characteristics, and anthropometry and body composition were measured.
   At the end of the follow up, the following main outcomes were determined: pregnancy outcomes (incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, weight gain during pregnancy, type of delivery, and neonatal outcomes (gestational age, birth weight, gender, Apgar score 1 min/5 min, type of resuscitation (I/II/III/IV), and pH of umbilical cord blood). Descriptive statistics for cross-sectional data, linear mixed regression models for absolute differences in changes baseline-final measurements were used as statistical analyses.
   Discussion: Although the effectiveness of physical activity programmes on improving maternal and neonatal outcomes has heretofore been studied, the impact of free time physical activity during pregnancy has not been assessed using objective measures. This paper reports the design of a prospective cohort study that aims to assess the physical activity levels of pregnant women, and to estimate the relationship between those physical activity levels with maternal and neonatal outcomes.
   This study could contribute to providing evidence for the formulation of recommendations for physical activity for pregnant women.

AB Background: The importance of maternal sleep and its contribution to maternal and fetal health during pregnancy is increasingly being recognised. However, the ability to accurately recall sleep practices during pregnancy has been questioned. The aim of this study is to test the accuracy of recall of normal sleep practices in late pregnancy.
   Methods: Thirty healthy women between 35 and 38 weeks of gestation underwent level III respiratory polysomnography (PSG) with infrared digital video recordings in their own homes. Data regarding sleep positions, number of times getting out of bed during the night and respiratory measures were collected. A sleep questionnaire was administered the morning after the recorded sleep. Continuous data were assessed using Spearman's Rho and Bland-Altman. Cohen's Kappa was used to assess recall in the categorical variables.
   Results: Two-thirds of participants went to sleep on their left side. There was good agreement in sleep onset position between video and questionnaire data (Kappa 0.52), however the there was poor agreement on position on wakening (Kappa 0.24). The number of times getting out of bed during the night was accurately recalled (Kappa 0.65). Twenty five out of 30 participants snored as recorded by PSG. Questionnaire data was inaccurate for this measure. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated acceptable agreement between video and questionnaire data for estimated sleep duration, but not the time taken to fall asleep (sleep latency). One participant had mild obstructive sleep apnoea and another probable high upper airways resistance.
   Conclusions: Sleep onset position, sleep duration and the number of times getting out of bed during the night were accurately recalled, but sleep latency and sleep position on waking were not. This study identifies the sleep variables that can be accurately obtained by questionnaire and those that cannot.

AB The role of orexin in the organization of the sleep-wake cycle (SWC) is well known. The aim of this study was to examine the timing of the orexinergic system formation in rat postnatal ontogenesis and to assess the role of orexin A in the SWC organization under normal conditions and after prenatal hypoxia undergone on days 14 and 19 of embryogenesis. The SWC was investigated in 30-day-old rats with electrodes implanted into the somatosensory and occipital cortex. Immunoreactivity within the orexigenic structures of the lateral hypothalamus was analyzed. It was shown that in control 14-day-old animals the orexinergic structures were in their formative stage, whereas in 30-day-old rats they were already as formed as in adults. In 14-day-old rats, prenatal hypoxia evoked retarded formation of the orexinergic system. In 30-day-old animals, hypoxia undergone in the prenatal period increased the activity of the orexinergic system, which was higher in animals exposed to hypoxia on day 19 than on day 14 of gestation. In 30-day-old rats, these changes were reflected in the SWC formation in the form of shorter slow-wave sleep, more fitful sleep and increased number of transitions from slow- to fast-wave sleep. The results obtained are discussed in the light of the adaptive-compensatory role of the orexigenic system in postnatal ontogenesis after prenatal damage to the central nervous system.

   INTERVENTIONS; POSTPARTUM; PROBIOTICS; PREGNANCY; SYMPTOMS
AB Objective: Review the literature on excessive crying in young infants, also known as infantile colic, and its effects on family dynamics, its pathophysiology, and new treatment interventions.
   Data source: The literature review was carried out in the Medline, PsycINFO, LILACS, SciELO, and Cochrane Library databases, using the terms "excessive crying,'' and "infantile colic,'' as well technical books and technical reports on child development, selecting the most relevant articles on the subject, with emphasis on recent literature published in the last five years.
   Summary of the findings: Excessive crying is a common symptom in the first 3 months of life and leads to approximately 20% of pediatric consultations. Different prevalence rates of excessive crying have been reported, ranging from 14% to approximately 30% in infants up to 3 months of age. There is evidence linking excessive crying early in life with adaptive problems in the preschool period, as well as with early weaning, maternal anxiety and depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other behavioral problems. Several pathophysiological mechanisms can explain these symptoms, such as circadian rhythm alterations, central nervous system immaturity, and alterations in the intestinal microbiota. Several treatment alternatives have been described, including behavioral measures, manipulation techniques, use of medication, and acupuncture, with controversial results and effectiveness.
   Conclusion: Excessive crying in the early months is a prevalent symptom; the pediatrician's attention is necessary to understand and adequately manage the problem and offer support to exhausted parents. The prescription of drugs of questionable action and with potential side effects is not a recommended treatment, except in extreme situations. The effectiveness of dietary treatments and use of probiotics still require confirmation. There is incomplete evidence regarding alternative treatments such as manipulation techniques, acupuncture, and use of the herbal supplements and behavioral interventions.

AB Cannabis is popularly believed to be a relatively benign substance. Cannabis is also considered to have potential medical benefits, and medical marijuana has been legislated in many parts of the world. However, a recent meta-analysis found that cannabinoids were associated with only modest benefits for chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting, small and inconsistent benefits for pain and spasticity, and inconclusive benefits for other indications such as improvement of appetite and weight, reduction in tic severity, and improvement of mood or sleep. On the flip side, cannabinoids and cannabis have acute and long-term adverse effects. In randomized controlled trials, cannabinoids increase the risk of total adverse events, serious adverse events, and dropout due to adverse events. Cannabis impairs cognition, and driving after cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents, including fatal accidents. Long-term cannabis use may lead to dependence, respiratory conditions, psychosis, and possibly cancer, as well. Cannabis use during pregnancy may compromise certain pregnancy outcomes such as fetal growth, and use during adolescence may compromise neurodevelopment, social adjustment, and vocational success. The composition and bioavailability of cannabis vary across preparations of the substance and routes of administration; this limits the ability to generalize the findings of studies. The findings of older research may no longer apply to current strains of cannabis that are higher in psychotogenic content. It is important for medical professionals and the lay public to understand the limitations of the efficacy data and the seriousness of the risks associated with cannabis use in medical and recreational contexts.

AB Objectives: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is a chronic pain disorder usually affecting women in their fertile period of life. However, the relationship between FS and pregnancy has not been studied in depth. The effect of FS on the course of pregnancy is poorly investigated in the current literature. Here we aimed to investigate the effects of FS to menarche age, gravidity, parity and duration of breastfeeding.
   Methods: One hundred and eighty-seven non-pregnant females attending between March 2015-June 2015, to Malatya State Hospital Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic, were included in this prospective study. One hundred eleven (111) of them were diagnosed with FS according to the American Rheumatology Association (ACR) 2010 criteria and were defined as group 1; group 2 comprised of seventy six (76) non-pregnant healthy volunteers. All participants were asked about their menarche age, marriage age, gravidity, parity, duration of breastfeeding by conducting a basic questionnaire survey. Patients' body mass index (BMI) were recorded. Depression parameters were evaluated by Beck Depression Scale (BDS).
   Results: The average age of the patients was 39.04 +/- 9.21 (FS) and 38.47 +/- 9.65 (Control) years; first menarche age was at 13.28 +/- 1.38 (FS) and 13.59 +/- 1.54 years (Control), and marriage age was 20.1 +/- 3.62 (FS) and 20.69 +/- 3.90 years (Control), respectively. No statistically significant difference was found (p=0.598) between BMI values (FS, 27.76 +/- 4.95; Control 26.90 +/- 4.56 kg/m(2)). The results from both groups were similar in terms of gravidity, parity, and breastfeeding duration, with no statistically significant differences (p=0.252, 0.093, 0.075, respectively). The only significant difference was found in the depression parameter. The BDS results were statistically different between the groups, found higher in FS group (p=0.000).
   Conclusion: FS occurs as a result of symptoms such as mood disorder, anxiety, cognitive and sleep disorders, and also hormonal changes; no exact cause has yet been established. The syndrome usually occurs during fertile period of young female. According to the findings of our study, FS has no negative effect on the outcome of gravidity, parity, and duration of breastfeeding in Turkish women. Further studies about the effects of FS on the course of pregnancy are required.

AB Objective: This study is an investigation of differences in regulatory problems (RPs; crying, sleeping, feeding) expressed by infants born very preterm (VP; <32 wk gestation) or with very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500 g) and infants born at full term (FT) during the first 18 months of life. It investigates the prevalence of single and multiple RPs, their persistence and how early in infancy RPs still found at 18 months of age can be predicted. Method: This prospective longitudinal study of 73 VP/VLBW and 105 FT infants utilized a standard interview of mothers to assess regulatory problems among the infants at term, 3, 6, and 18 months of age. Results: Few differences were found between VP/VLBW and FT infants in the first 6 months. At 18 months, VP/VLBW infants had more single sleeping (RR = 2.2, CI = 1.3-3.7), feeding (RR = 1.4, CI = 1.03-1.8); and multiple RPs (RR = 1.7, CI = 1.02-2.8) than FT infants. In VP/VLBW infants, RPs as early as 3 months and in FT infants RPs as early, as 6 months predicted RPs at 18 months. Those infants who had persistent RPs in the first 6 months of life were more likely to still have RPs at 18 months. Conclusion: VP/VLBW children are at slightly increased risk for RPs at term and in the second year of life. Clinicians should be aware that RPs that persist across the first 6 months point to increased risk of continuing RPs into toddlerhood in both VP/VLBW and FT infants.

AB Sleep has a strong influence on interictal epileptiform discharges and on epileptic seizures. Interictal epileptiform discharges are activated by sleep deprivation and sleep, and some epilepsies occur almost exclusively during sleep. Treatment of sleep-related epilepsy should take in account the type of epileptic syndrome, the type of seizures, the patient characteristics, and also the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Proper characterization of the epilepsy is essential to choose appropriate antiepileptic drugs. Drugs effective in focal epilepsy may be used to treat benign genetic focal epilepsies such as rolandic epilepsy and other focal (frontal or not) sleep epilepsies. These include both classical (such as carbamazepine) and new (such as levetiracetam and lacosamide) antiepileptic drugs. Drug-resistant cases should be evaluated for epilepsy surgery, which may be efficacious in this setting. Valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate, levetiracetam, and perampanel are effective against generalized tonic-clonic seizures in genetic generalized epilepsies, which frequently happen on awakening. Risks of valproate should be considered before prescribing it to women of childbearing age. Specific syndromes such as ESES require specific treatment such as a combination of high dose steroids, benzodiazepines, levetiracetam, and even surgery when an epileptogenic lesion is present. Sleep disorders that may worsen epilepsy such as obstructive sleep apnea or insomnia should be adequately treated to improve seizure frequency. Adequate control of seizures during sleep (especially generalized tonic-clonic seizures) decreases risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).

AB Prior studies have found that close mother-child sleep proximity helps increase rates of breastfeeding, and breastfeeding itself is linked to better maternal and infant health. In this study, we examine whether breastfeeding and infant bed-sharing are related to daily rhythms of the stress-responsive hormone cortisol. We found that bed-sharing was related to flatter diurnal cortisol slopes, and there was a marginal effect for breastfeeding to predict steeper cortisol slopes. Furthermore, mothers who breastfeed but do not bed-share had the steepest diurnal cortisol slopes, whereas mothers who bed-shared and did not breastfeed had the flattest slopes (P < .05). These results were significant after controlling for subjective sleep quality, perceived stress, depression, socioeconomic status, race, and maternal age. Findings from this study indicate that infant parenting choices recommended for infants (breastfeeding and separate sleep surfaces for babies) may also be associated with more optimal stress hormone profiles for mothers.

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep disorder that may be associated with pregnancy. Studies have found that the prevalence of RLS among pregnant women ranged from 10 to 34%. Typically, there is complete remission of symptoms soon after parturition; however, in some patients, they may continue postpartum. RLS has been shown to be associated with a number of complications in pregnancy including preeclampsia and increased incidence of Cesarean sections. Although multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain this association, each individual hypothesis cannot completely explain the whole pathogenesis. Present understanding suggests that a strong family history, low serum iron and ferritin level, and high estrogen level during pregnancy might play important roles. Vitamin D deficiency and calcium metabolism may also play a role. Medical treatment of RLS during pregnancy is difficult and challenging considering the risks to mother and fetus. However, in some cases, the disease may be severe enough to require treatment.

AB Background: Optimal use of long-lasting insecticidal (LLINs) for malaria prevention depends on mass distribution, the users' perception and behaviour of local malaria vectors. This study was aimed at assessing knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of communities about LLINs and fabric integrities and insecticidal activities of nets under use in Wolaita zone, Sothern Ethiopia.
   Methods: Semi-structured interview questionnaires were used to collect data on KAP variables and WHO cone bioassay was used to test the insecticidal activity of sampled nets against an insectary colony of Anopheles arabiensis. Holes and repairs on surfaces of sample nets were counted and categorized following WHO guidelines to assess their fabric integrities. Chi-square (X-2) tests were used to verify associations between the demographic profiles of the respondents and their responses to KAP questionnaires.
   Results: Out of a total of 770 household heads interviewed, 323 (42 %) and 447 (58 %) were males and females, respectively. The average family size in the surveyed households was 5.25 (+/- 0.70 SE, range 1-12). The majority (81.1 %) of the households owned at least one LLIN. The average numbers of LLINs being used and sleeping places in the households were 1.61 (0.04 SE, range 0-4) and 2.27(0.03 SE, range 1-6), respectively. Most of the respondents (n = 687; 89.2 %) believed LLINs prevent malaria by killing or acting as physical barriers against mosquitoes. About 21 and 14 % of the respondents considered children under five years and pregnant women as priority groups for sleeping under LLINs. Households use LLINs consistently throughout the year (86.4 %) and tuck nets into bedding materials while sleeping (90.1 %). Physical inspection of fabric integrity of sampled LLINs revealed holes ranging from size 1 (0.5-2 cm) to size 4 (> 25 cm) mostly on lower ("right/left") surfaces. Moreover, most surfaces of sampled LLINs caused 100 % knockdown and mortality on insectary colonies of Anopheles arabiensis.
   Conclusions: The overall knowledge, attitude and practice about LLINs were satisfactory in the study areas. However, the family size net ratio must be narrowed and attention needs to be given to malaria vulnerable groups (children < 5 years of age and pregnant women). Continuous monitoring and evaluation of use and durability (fabric integrity and insecticidal activity) of LLINs should be conducted to avoid misuse and associated attrition of nets before the intended period.

AB Background: Malaria in pregnancy contributes greatly to maternal morbidity and mortality in Uganda. Thus it is urgent to identify possible barriers that limit access to existing interventions. The aim of this study was to assess perceptions and practices regarding malaria prevention during pregnancy in a peri-urban area and explore ways to scale-up malaria prevention interventions, since little is known about malaria in peri-urban settings.
   Methods: A survey was conducted in Kabale municipality south-western Uganda from April-June, 2015. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire targeting pregnant women, who delivered in the study area 1 year prior to the survey. Univariate analyses were performed at assess the level of knowledge and practices on malaria prevention during pregnancy.
   Results: A total of 800 women was interviewed. The majority of women, 96.1 % knew that malaria was a dangerous disease in pregnancy; 60.3 % knew that it caused anaemia, and 71.3 % associated malaria with general weakness. However, fewer women (44.9 %) knew that malaria in pregnancy caused abortions, while 14.9 % thought it caused stillbirths. Similarly, few women (19 %) attended the recommend four antenatal care visits; less than a half (48.8 %) accessed two doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for malaria prevention in pregnancy while 16.3 % received at least three doses of SP, as recommended by the current policy. The main reasons for poor antenatal care attendance were: women felt healthy and did not see a need to go for antenatal care, long distances and long waiting hours at clinics. The reasons given for not taking SP for malaria prevention were: women were not feeling sick; they were not aware of the benefits of SP in pregnancy, they were sleeping under insecticide-treated nets; fear of side effects of SP; and the antenatal care clinics were far.
   Conclusion: Despite a good knowledge that malaria is a dangerous disease in pregnancy, there was poor access to antenatal care and use of SP for malaria prevention in pregnancy. There is urgent to address existing health system constraints in order to increases access to malaria prevention in pregnancy in this setting.

AB Background: Malaria remains a major threat to some 3.2 billion persons globally. Malaria contributes heavily to the overall disease burden in Mozambique and is considered endemic. A cornerstone of Mozambique's vector control strategy has been to strive for universal coverage of insecticide-treated nets (ITN).
   Methods: The study is a population-based cross-sectional survey of female heads-of-household in Zambezia Province, Mozambique conducted during August-September, 2010 and April-May, 2014. Analyses accounted for a stratified two-stage cluster sample design. Outcomes of interest included sleeping under a mosquito net during the previous night. Descriptive statistics were calculated for three oversampled districts and for the entire province. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate factors associated with both changes over time and increased mosquito bed net usage.
   Results: Of the 3916 households interviewed in 2010 and 3906 households in 2014, 64.3 % were in possession of at least one mosquito bed net. A higher proportion of households in Namacurra (90 %) reported possession of a mosquito net, compared to Alto Molocue (77 %) and Morrumbala (34 %), respectively in 2014. Of pregnant respondents, 58.6 % reported sleeping under a mosquito net the previous night in 2010 compared to 68.4 % in 2014. Fifty percent of children 0-59 months slept under a mosquito net the previous night in 2010 compared to 60 % in 2014. Factors associated with use of a mosquito net for female head-of-household respondents were higher education, understanding Portuguese, larger household size, having electricity in the household, and larger household monthly income. As travel time to a health facility increased (per 1 h), respondents had 13 % lower odds of sleeping under a mosquito net (OR 0.87; 95 % CI 0.74-1.01, p = 0.07). Pregnant women in 2014 had a 2.4 times higher odds of sleeping under a bed net if they lived in Namacurra compared to Alto Molocue (95 % CI 0.91-6.32, p = 0.002 for district). Higher maternal education, living in Namacurra, and acquisition of mosquito bed nets were associated with a child 0-59 months reporting sleeping under the net in the previous night in 2014.
   Conclusions: Intensified focus on the poorest, least educated, and most distant from health services is needed to improve equity of ITN availability and usage. Additionally, while some districts have already surpassed goals in terms of coverage and utilization of ITN, renewed emphasis should be placed on bringing all geographic regions of the province closer to meeting these targets.

ID SELF-SELECTED MUSIC; THERAPY; DISORDERS; BRAIN
AB Prenatal sleep disturbance has been associated with undesirable birthing outcomes. To determine the effectiveness of listening to music at home in improving sleep quality, 121 Taiwanese pregnant women with poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] score > 5) were systematically assigned, with a random start to music listening (n=61) or control (n=60) group. Participants in the music listening group self-regulated listening to music in addition to receiving general prenatal care similar to that in the control group for 2 weeks. The PSQI and State-Anxiety Inventory were used to assess outcomes. ANCOVA analyses were used with the pretest scores as covariates and showed significant improvement in sleep quality, stress, and anxiety in the music listening group compared with the control group. The most frequently used music genre by participants in the experimental group was lullabies, followed by classical music and crystal baby music. This study supported the theory that 2-week music listening interventions may reduce stress, anxiety, and yield better sleep quality for sleep-disturbed pregnant women. The analysis of participants' journals also implied that the expectant mothers' choices of musical genres may correlate more with perceived prenatal benefits or the desire to interact with their unborn child.

AB Objective: Preeclampsia leads to chronic intrauterine hypoxia by interfering with placental blood supply. The aim of this study was to investigate whether preeclampsia exposure has an influence on the central nervous system of infants, as monitored by amplitude integrated electro-encephalography (aEEG).
   Methods: We recruited 52 infants with gestational age between 30 and 34 weeks. Twenty-seven infants were born to preeclamptic mothers, and 25 gestational age-matched infants whose mothers were healthy were enrolled as a control group. aEEG recordings were performed between 24 and 48 h of life using a cerebral function monitor (CFM) (Olympic Brainz monitor). Along with aEEG, middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow velocities (BFV) were measured using Doppler ultrasound.
   Results: The duration of quiet sleep was significantly shorter (P = 0.001), and Burdjalov score was lower (P = 0.04) in the preeclampsia group. However, there was no change in MCA BFV in this group.
   Conclusions: Preeclampsia altered cerebral electrical activity of premature infants born to preeclamptic mothers.

AB Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a burdensome sleep disorder, has been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, and related disorders. However, the relationship of RLS to history of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), a predictor of subsequent CVD, diabetes, and associated conditions, remains little explored. In this study, we investigated the relationship of RLS to history of PIH in a sample of primary care patients. Methods: Participants were women aged 40 years drawn from an anonymous survey study of West Virginia primary care patients. Data collected included detailed information on demographics, lifestyle factors, sleep patterns, and reproductive/medical history; the survey also included an RLS diagnostic questionnaire. Women who were pregnant or unsure about their pregnancy status were excluded from the analyses. Results: Of the 498 participants in the final analytic sample, 24.5% met diagnostic criteria for RLS (17.9% with symptoms once/week, 11.9% with symptoms 3 times/week); 73 (16.5% of parous women) reported a history of PIH, defined as physician-diagnosed preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. After adjustment for demographics, lifestyle characteristics, obesity, reproductive history, health conditions, and other factors, those reporting a history of PIH were approximately twice as likely to meet criteria for RLS (odds ratio [OR]=1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.1, 3.6). These associations increased in magnitude with increasing symptom frequency (adjusted OR for RLS with symptoms 3 times/week=3.8; CI 1.9, 7.6; p for trend=0.003). Conclusions: History of PIH was strongly and positively related to current RLS in this study of primary care patients; these findings further support a possible role for metabolic dysregulation in RLS etiology.

AB Objective To examine whether time of delivery influences the risk of neonatal morbidity among women with singleton pregnancies.
   Study Design Secondary analysis of data from the Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network Factor V Leiden Mutation study. We categorized time of delivery as day (07:0016:59), evening (17:00-23:59), and overnight (midnight-06:59). Severe neonatal morbidity was defined by at least one of the following: respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the newborn, sepsis, seizures, neonatal intensive care admission, or a 5-minute APGAR <= 3. We calculated frequencies of severe neonatal morbidity by time of delivery. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine whether time of delivery was independently associated with severe neonatal morbidity.
   Results Among 4,087 women, 1,917 (46.9%) delivered during the day, 1,140 (27.9%) delivered in the evening, and 1,030 (25.2%) delivered overnight. We observed no significant differences in the rates of neonatal morbidity between delivery time periods (day: 12.3%; evening: 12.8%; overnight: 12.6%; p = 0.9). No significant association was observed between time of delivery and neonatal morbidity after adjustment for maternal, obstetric, and peripartum factors.
   Conclusion Our findings suggest that time of delivery is not associated with severe neonatal morbidity.

AB To improve the knowledge in chronophysiology we investigated the causal link between the most important physiological variable studied until now; ten Sarda ewes and ten Sarda goats, pluriparus not pregnant and no lactating, were used. Animals were housed under natural environmental conditions in a common stall, alfalfa hay and water were available ad libitum. Each animal was equipped with an Actiwatch-Mini (R) for recording total activity. Blood samples were collected every 4 h over a 48 h period for the assessment of melatonin concentration. Rectal temperature was recorded with a digital thermometer immediately before the blood sampling at each data point. Single cosinor method showed a daily rhythm of studied variables. Higher MESOR and amplitude values of melatonin and rectal temperature were observed in sheep than in goats. The diurnal acrophase of locomotor activity was statistically different from the nocturnal acrophase of melatonin and rectal temperature, with no differences between the two species. Robustness was statistically lower in total locomotor activity in comparison with the others two variables, with a differences due to species in melatonin daily rhythm. In conclusion, in small ruminants, melatonin and rectal temperature daily rhythms are strictly correlated, and are not associated with the locomotor activity rhythm.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Abnormal respiratory rate (RR) is a key symptom of disease in the newborn. The aim of this study was to establish the reference range for RR during the first 24 hours of life in healthy infants born at term.
   METHODS: Infants were included at the hospital postnatal ward when time permitted. During sleep or a defined quiet state, RR was counted at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours by placing the bell of a stethoscope in front of the nostrils and mouth for 60 seconds. Data on maternal health, pregnancies, and births were obtained from medical records and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway.
   RESULTS: The study included 953 infants. Median RRs were 46 breaths/minute at 2 hours, thereafter 42 to 44 breaths/minute. The 95th percentile was 65 breaths/minute at 2 hours, thereafter 58 to 60 breaths/minute. The fifth percentile was 30 to 32 breaths/minute. Within these limits, the intraindividual variation was wide. The overall mean RR was 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7 to 5.7, P < .001) breaths/minute higher while awake than during sleep, 3.1 (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.8, P < .001) breaths/minute higher after heavy meconium staining of the amniotic fluid, and 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8 to 2.4, P < .001) breaths/minute higher in boys than girls. RR did not differ for infants born after vaginal versus cesarean deliveries.
   CONCLUSIONS: The RR percentiles established from this study allow for a scientifically based use of RR when assessing newborn infants born at term.

AB Anxiety during pregnancy has been linked to adverse maternal health outcomes, including postpartum depression (PPD). However, there has been limited study of biological mechanisms underlying behavioral predictors of PPD during pregnancy.
   Considering the shared etiology of chronic stress amongst antenatal behavioral predictors, the primary goal of this pilot study was to examine associations among stress-related physiological factors (including GABA-ergic neurosteroids) and stress-related behavioral indices of anxiety during pregnancy.
   Fourteen nulliparous women in their second trimester of a singleton pregnancy underwent speech and mental arithmetic stress, following a 2-week subjective and objective recording of sleep-wake behavior.
   Lower cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of ALLO + pregnanolone throughout the entire stressor protocol (area under the curve, AUC) were associated with greater negative emotional responses to stress, and lower cortisol AUC was associated with worse sleep quality. Lower adrenocorticotropic hormone was associated with greater anxious and depressive symptoms. Stress produced paradoxical reductions in cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of allopregnanolone + pregnanolone, while tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone levels were elevated.
   These data suggest that cortisol, progesterone, and ALLO + pregnanolone levels in the second trimester of pregnancy are inversely related to negative emotional symptoms, and the negative impact of acute stress challenge appears to exert its effects by reducing these steroids to further promote negative emotional responses.

AB Study Objectives: The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is more prevalent in ex-preterm children compared to the general pediatric population. However, it is unknown whether OSAS in ex-preterm children is associated with specific perinatal risk factors. This multicenter cohort study aimed to determine perinatal factors associated with OSAS at school age.
   Methods: 197 ex-preterm (500-1,250 g) children aged 5-12 y who participated as neonates in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of caffeine versus placebo (Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity) underwent comprehensive ambulatory polysomnography. A negative binomial regression model was used to identify perinatal risk factors associated with OSAS.
   Results: 19 children had OSAS (9.6%). Chorioamnionitis and multiple gestation were positively associated with OSAS with P values of 0.014 and 0.03, respectively. Maternal white race (P = 0.047) and maternal age (P = 0.002) were negatively associated with OSAS. Other risk factors, such as birth weight, Apgar score at 5 min, antenatal corticosteroids, delivery route, and sex were not significant.
   Conclusions: OSAS is very frequent, and is associated with chorioamnionitis and multiple gestation in ex-preterm children. Those born to older white mothers appear to be protected. We speculate that the former may be due to systemic inflammation and the latter to a higher socio-economic status.

AB Our goal was to examine associations of infant sleep and feeding patterns with maternal sleep and mood among women at risk for postpartum depression. Participants were 30 women (age +/- SD = 28.3 +/- 5.1 years) with a history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) who completed daily sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs to estimate sleep, and had their mood assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) during four separate weeks of the perinatal period (33 weeks pregnancy and weeks 2, 6, and 16 postpartum). They logged their infants' sleep and feeding behaviors daily and reported postnatal stress on the Childcare Stress Inventory (CSI) at week 16. Mothers' actigraphically estimated sleep showed associations with infant sleep and feeding patterns only at postpartum week 2. Shorter duration of the longest infant-sleep bout was associated with shorter maternal sleep duration (p = .02) and lower sleep efficiency (p = .04), and maternal sleep efficiency was negatively associated with the number of infant-sleep bouts (p = .008) and duration of infant feeding (p = .008). Neither infant sleep nor feeding was associated with maternal sleep at 6 or 16 weeks, but more disturbed infant sleep and more frequent feeding at 6 weeks were associated with higher HAM-D scores at 6 and 16 weeks and higher CSI scores. Sleep in the mother-infant dyad is most tightly linked in the early postpartum weeks, but mothers continue to experience disturbed sleep and infant sleep and feeding behaviors continue to be associated with mothers' depressive symptoms and stress ratings as long as 16 weeks postpartum. These data imply that interventions designed to improve maternal sleep and postpartum mood should include both mothers and infants because improving infant sleep alone is not likely to improve maternal sleep, and poor infant sleep is linked to postpartum depression and stress.

AB Most interventions to prevent postpartum depression (PPD) focus on the mother rather than the mother-infant dyad. As strong relationships between infant sleep and cry behavior and maternal postpartum mood have been demonstrated by previous research, interventions targeted at the dyad may reduce symptoms of PPD. The goal of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of Practical Resources for Effective Postpartum Parenting (PREPP). PREPP is a new PPD prevention protocol that aims to treat women at risk for PPD by promoting maternally mediated behavioral changes in their infants, while also including mother-focused skills. Results of this randomized control trial (RCT) (n = 54) indicate that this novel, brief intervention was well tolerated and effective in reducing maternal symptoms of anxiety and depression, particularly at 6 weeks postpartum. Additionally, this study found that infants of mothers enrolled in PREPP had fewer bouts of fussing and crying at 6 weeks postpartum than those infants whose mothers were in the Enhanced TAU group. These preliminary results indicate that PREPP has the potential to reduce the incidence of PPD in women at risk and to directly impact the developing mother-child relationship, the mother's view of her child, and child outcomes.

AB The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of minor and major depression among pregnant women in the USA. Also, we compare prevalence of depression among pregnant and non-pregnant women while controlling for relevant covariates. A population-representative sample of pregnant women (n = 3010) surveyed for the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System was compared to a sample of women who were not pregnant (n = 68,620). Binary logistic regression was used to determine prevalence ratios of depression for pregnant and non-pregnant women while controlling for the effects of age, race, annual income, employment status, educational level, marital status, general health, and availability of emotional support. Depression was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8). The prevalence of major depression was no greater among pregnant women (6.1 %) compared to non-pregnant women (7 %; adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.1, 95 % confidence interval (CI) .8 and 1.5). The prevalence of minor depression was greater among pregnant women (16.6 %) compared to non-pregnant women (11.4 %; adjusted PR = 1.5, 95 % CI 1.2 and 1.9). Prevalence ratios are adjusted for the effects of covariates noted above. Prevalence of major depression is not associated with pregnancy, but minor depression is more likely among women who are pregnant.

AB Introduction: Up to 84% of prematurely born infants suffer hypoxic, anoxic, and ischemic insults. Those infants with subsequent behavioral, motor or cognitive dysfunction represent 8-11% of all live births. Yet, no interventions employed during pregnancy attenuate risk of morbidity in those at-risk infants. Dietary supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) has been shown to reduce stroke-induced neuropathology in rat models emulating this adverse clinical event. To extend those studies we sought to determine whether maternal dietary supplementation with w-3 PUFAs would confer neuroprotection against hypoxia-induced neurochemical dysfunction in newborn rat pups exposed to repetitive hypoxic insults.
   Methods: We provided pregnant rats with either a omega-3 PUFA enriched diet or else a standard rat chow diet. At postnatal day 7, pups were assigned randomly to either repetitive hypoxic insults or repetitive bursts of room air. On postnatal day 12, pups were sacrificed and brain dopamine levels characterized.
   Results: Baseline brain dopamine levels did not differ between rat pups born to dams who received w-3 PUFA enriched versus standard rat chow diets. Rat pups born to dams maintained on normal diets, who were exposed to five days of repetitive hypoxic insults, experienced a 57% reduction in striatal dopamine levels accompanied by significant apoptosis. In contrast, omega-3 PUFA-enriched newborn pups experienced no loss in striatal dopamine levels, and only minimal apoptosis.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that it may be feasible to confer neuroprotection against hypoxiainduced dopamine dysfunction to newborns likely to experience hypoxic insults. This could significantly improve the outcomes of those 8-11% of newborns who would otherwise experience hypoxia-induced behavioral, motor and cognitive dysfunction.

AB This study examined the incidence of adverse prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal experiences amongst children with anxiety disorders, and the relationship to clinical symptomology and functional impairment in treatment-seeking children (N = 107) with a primary anxiety disorder. Anxious children had higher rates of reported maternal prescription medication use during pregnancy, maternal smoking and illness during pregnancy and neonatal complications (including neonatal intensive care and feeding issues) compared with population base rates and non-affected children. Almost one-third had early problems with sleep. Developmental problems were common with more than half having at least one area of delay. More than three quarters of anxious children had a first-degree family member with a psychiatric history. There were several associations between neonatal complications and subsequent clinical symptomology, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depressive comorbidity, anxiety severity and functional impairment. Findings suggest higher rates of perinatal complications in anxious children.

AB Background: Sleep disturbances are common in women, especially during pregnancy. Previous studies have confirmed the importance of sleep disturbances as a risk factor of adverse pregnancy outcomes and the need for screening and treatment of inadequate sleep. These reports, however, did not examine health-related quality of life which may be affected by sleep long before adverse clinical consequences are detectable in women during pregnancy.
   Objectives: To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between sleep and health-related quality of life in pregnant women.
   Design: A prospective observational study.
   Setting: A university-affiliated hospital in Taiwan and participants' homes.
   Participants: A total of 164 pregnant women completed questionnaires and wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 days each trimester.
   Methods: Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy, subjective sleep was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and health-related quality of life was measured using the SF-12v2 questionnaire across three trimesters. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between sleep and health-related quality of life.
   Results: Sixty-four (39.0%) women consistently had an average sleep efficiency < 85% by actigraphy and 40 (24.4%) had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score > 5 in all three trimesters. Cross-sectionally, more actigraphic daytime sleep (p = 0.04) and better subjective sleep quality (p < 0.01) were associated with better physical health-related quality of life in first-trimester pregnant women. Better actigraphic sleep efficiency (p = 0.04) and better subjective sleep quality (p < 0.01) were associated with better mental health-related quality of life in second-trimester pregnant women. Longer actigraphic total nighttime sleep (p < 0.01) and better subjective sleep quality (p < 0.01) were associated with better mental health-related quality of life in third-trimester pregnant women. Longitudinally, first-trimester actigraphic total nighttime sleep (p < 0.05) and subjective sleep quality (p < 0.01) predicted mental health-related quality of life in the second and third trimester.
   Conclusions: Sleep disturbances are a highly prevalent and persistent problem in pregnant women. Adequate sleep is essential for women at all pregnancy stages and improving nocturnal sleep quantity and quality in early gestation is of utmost importance for an optimal health-related quality of life later in pregnancy.

AB Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) complicates 5-10% of pregnancies and is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, mortality and neurodevelopmental delay.
   The development of sleep and cardiovascular control are closely coupled and IUGR is known to alter this development. In the long-term, IUGR is associated with altered sleep and an increased risk of hypertension in adulthood.
   Melatonin plays an important role in the sleep-wake cycle. Experimental animal studies have shown that melatonin therapy has neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects in the IUGR fetus. Consequently, clinical trials are currently underway to assess the short and long term effects of antenatal melatonin therapy in IUGR pregnancies. Given melatonin's role in sleep regulation, this hormone could affect the developing infants' sleep-wake cycle and cardiovascular function after birth. In this review, we will 1) examine the role of melatonin as a therapy for IUGR pregnancies and the potential implications on sleep and the cardiovascular system; 2) examine the development of sleep-wake cycle in fetal and neonatal life; 3) discuss the development of cardiovascular control during sleep; 4) discuss the effect of IUGR on sleep and the cardiovascular system and 5) discuss the future implications of melatonin therapy in IUGR pregnancies.

AB Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a hyperglycemic state detected during pregnancy, is an established risk factor for diabetes. However, treatment during pregnancy in and of itself is not able to eliminate this risk, and a considerable fraction of women with GDM will develop frank diabetes in the decade following pregnancy. Our aim is to conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention program implemented after a pregnancy complicated by GDM in delaying or preventing the development of type 2 diabetes.
   Methods: Women aged 18 or older identified as having recent GDM are recruited and followed by telephone to assess eligibility for the trial. To be eligible, women must have used insulin during pregnancy or present intermediate hyperglycemia postpartum. Women are encouraged to enter the trial as early as 10 weeks, and are permitted to do so up to 2 years after a pregnancy with GDM. An estimated 740 women will be randomized to either conventional care or to coach-based interventions focused on breastfeeding, weight loss, healthy eating, and increased physical activity, and predominantly delivered by telephone. Women are followed annually to detect new onset diabetes, the primary outcome, and additional secondary outcomes which include reversion to normoglycemia, weight loss, physical activity and fitness, and insulin resistance.
   Discussion: Though previous studies have demonstrated that type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented, no study has yet demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of similar interventions implemented in the postpartum period for women with recent GDM. If shown to be successful, this approach could become an important means of preventing diabetes in primary care settings.

AB Objectives
   To examine the associations of Intimate partner violence (IPV) with stress-related sleep disturbance (measured using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test [FIRST]) and poor sleep quality (measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) during early pregnancy.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study included 634 pregnant Peruvian women. In-person interviews were conducted in early pregnancy to collect information regarding IPV history, and sleep traits. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using logistic regression procedures.
   Results
   Lifetime IPV was associated with a 1.54-fold increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (95% CI: 1.08-2.17) and a 1.93-fold increased odds of poor sleep quality (95% CI: 1.33-2.81). Compared with women experiencing no IPV during lifetime, the aOR (95% CI) for stress-related sleep disturbance associated with each type of IPV were: physical abuse only 1.24 (95% CI: 0.84-1.83), sexual abuse only 3.44 (95% CI: 1.07-11.05), and physical and sexual abuse 2.51 (95% CI: 1.27-4.96). The corresponding aORs (95% CI) for poor sleep quality were: 1.72 (95% CI: 1.13-2.61), 2.82 (95% CI: 0.99-8.03), and 2.50 (95% CI: 1.30-4.81), respectively. Women reporting any IPV in the year prior to pregnancy had increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.17-3.67) and poor sleep quality (aOR = 2.27; 95% CI: 1.30-3.97) during pregnancy.
   Conclusion
   Lifetime and prevalent IPV exposures are associated with stress-related sleep disturbance and poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that sleep disturbances may be important mechanisms that underlie the lasting adverse effects of IPV on maternal and perinatal health.

AB Background: National guidelines in the UK, United States of America, Canada, and Australia have recently stressed the importance of identifying and treating antenatal anxiety and depression. However, there is little research into the most effective and acceptable ways of helping women manage their symptoms of anxiety and stress during pregnancy. Research indicates the necessity to consider the unique needs and concerns of perinatal populations to ensure treatment engagement, highlighting the need to develop specialised treatments which could be integrated within routine antenatal healthcare services. This trial aims to develop a brief intervention for antenatal anxiety, with a focus on embedding the delivery of the treatment within routine antenatal care.
   Methods/Design: This study is a two-phase feasibility trial. In phase 1 we will develop and pilot a brief intervention for antenatal anxiety, blended with group support, to be led by midwives. This intervention will draw on cognitive behavioural principles and wider learning from existing interventions that have been used to reduce anxiety in expectant mothers. The intervention will then be tested in a pilot randomised controlled trial in phase 2. The following outcomes will be assessed: (1) number of participants meeting eligibility criteria, (2) number of participants consenting to the study, (3) number of participants randomised, (4) number of sessions completed by those in the intervention arm, and (5) number of participants completing the post-intervention outcome measures. Secondary outcomes comprise: detailed feedback on acceptability, which will guide further development of the intervention; and outcome data on symptoms of maternal and paternal anxiety and depression, maternal quality of life, quality of couple relationship, mother-child bonding, infant temperament and infant sleep.
   Discussion: The study will provide important data to inform the design of a future full-scale randomised controlled trial of a brief intervention for anxiety during pregnancy. This will include information on its acceptability and feasibility regarding implementation within current antenatal services, which will inform whether ultimately this provision could be rolled out widely in healthcare settings.

TI Assessment of the usage and effectiveness of intermittent preventive
   treatment and insecticide-treated nets on the indicators of malaria
   among pregnant women attending antenatal care in the Buea Health
   District, Cameroon
SO MALARIA JOURNAL

AB Background: Malaria in pregnancy is an immense public health problem with at least 50 million pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas. To prevent malaria and its complications in pregnancy the World Health Organization recommends the use of intermittent preventive treatment sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP), the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), and effective case management. In most malaria endemic countries in Africa, 40 % of pregnant women sleep under ITNs. In Cameroon, about 90 % of pregnant women receive the first dose of SP, while 64 % take the complete dose. Following the 2011 mass-campaign of free distribution of ITNs coupled with routine ANC distribution of ITN and adoption of IPTp in Cameroon, little has been done to assess the effectiveness of both interventions outside of Yaounde, the capital city. This study sought to assess the usage and effectiveness of IPTp-SP and ITNs on malaria in pregnancy.
   Methods: The research was a cross-sectional hospital-based study that included 410 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in the Buea Health District. Capillary blood samples were collected to check malaria parasite by microscopy and haemoglobin levels by microhaematocrit technique.
   Results: A prevalence of 13.4 and 41.7 % was detected for malaria and anaemia, respectively. The Overall coverage of ITN was 32.4 % while that of ITPp was 63.2 %. Malaria prevalence was least (7.2 %) amongst women using both IPTp-SP and ITN while those with no intervention had the highest malaria prevalence of 18.6 % (X-2 = 6.188; P = 0.103). Of the women with malaria, 12.73 % were using ITN and had taken at least one dose of SP, 38.18 % had taken at least one dose IPTp only, 10.91 % were using only ITN and 38.18 % were not using any preventive measure. There was a difference in anaemia status within the different intervention groups (X-2 = 8.673; P = 0.034). Pregnant women using both interventions were less associated to malaria (OR = 0.341, 95 % CI = 0.138-0.841) compared to those using only one control method.
   Conclusion: Repeated doses of SP in combination with ITN use are effective in reducing malaria parasitaemia and improving haemoglobin level of pregnant women.

AB The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study-Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b) Heart Health Study (HHS) was designed to investigate the relationships between adverse pregnancy outcomes and modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The ongoing nuMoM2b-HHS, which started in 2013, is a prospective follow-up of the nuMoM2b cohort, which included 10,038 women recruited between 2010 and 2013 from 8 centers across the United States who were initially observed over the course of their first pregnancies. In this report, we detail the design and study procedures of the nuMoM2b-HHS. Women in the pregnancy cohort who consented to be contacted for participation in future studies were approached at 6-month intervals to ascertain health information and to maintain ongoing contact. Two to 5 years after completion of the pregnancy documented in the nuMoM2b, women in the nuMoM2b-HHS were invited to an in-person study visit. During this visit, they completed psychosocial and medical history questionnaires and had clinical measurements and biological specimens obtained. A subcohort of participants who had objective assessments of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy were asked to repeat this investigation. This unique prospective observational study includes a large, geographically and ethnically diverse cohort, rich depth of phenotypic information about adverse pregnancy outcomes, and clinical data and biospecimens from early in the index pregnancy onward. Data obtained from this cohort will provide mechanistic and clinical insights into how data on a first pregnancy can provide information about the potential development of subsequent risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

AB Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) has been shown to reduce lipid accumulation in liver in mice and rats. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether maternal COS feeding affects hepatic lipid metabolism via influencing the expression of circadian clock genes in piglets. From day (d) 85 of gestation to d 14 of lactation, sixteen pregnant sows were divided into a control group (basal diet without COS supplementation) and a COS group (30mg COS/kg basal diet). After farrowing, one piglet per litter in each group was selected for the collection of plasma and liver samples on d 0 and d 14 of age, respectively. Interestingly and significantly, we found that maternal COS supplementation promoted plasma and hepatic cholesterol accumulation and up-regulated the mRNA level of negative-regulated element period 1 (Per1), and reduced the abundance of the positive elements, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), and brain muscle Arnt-like 1 (BMAL1) in the suckling piglets on d 14. These alterations may promote the hepatic cholesterol accumulation, which, in turn, activates hepatic bile acid metabolism and attenuates the relative expression levels of lipid metabolism-associated genes in the liver. However, the expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 and the lipid profile in the plasma and liver were not affected by COS supplementation on d 0. Collectively, our results indicate that maternal supplementation with COS postpartum up-regulates cholesterol accumulation in suckling piglets at age d 14, in part, by the regulation of circadian clock genes.

AB In the United States, roughly half of women are either overweight (24.5%) or obese (21.4%) when they become pregnant. Women who are obese before pregnancy are at increased risk for a number of pregnancy complications relative to normal-weight women. Specifically, obesity is associated with significantly increased maternal risks, including gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and sleep disordered breathing. Maternal obesity is also associated with increased risks of adverse fetal outcomes, including prematurity, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, and abnormal fetal growth. In this review, we will discuss the implications of obesity with respect to antepartum care.

AB Maternal physiological adaptations, such as changes to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, are central to pregnancy success. Circadian variation of the HPA axis is dependent on clock gene rhythms in the hypothalamus, but it is not known whether pregnancy-induced changes in maternal glucocorticoid levels are mediated via this central clock. We hypothesized that hypothalamic expression of clock genes changes across mouse pregnancy and this is linked to altered HPA activity. The anterior hypothalamus and maternal plasma were collected from C57Bl/6J mice prior to pregnancy and on days 6, 10, 14 and 18 of gestation (term=d19), across a 24-h period (0800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 0000, 0400 h). Hypothalamic expression of clock genes and Crh was determined by qPCR, plasma ACTH concentration measured by Milliplex assay and plasma corticosterone concentration by LC-MS/MS. Expression of all clock genes varied markedly across gestation, most notably at mid-gestation when levels of each gene were elevated. The pregnancy-induced increase in maternal corticosterone levels (by up to 14-fold on day 14) was not accompanied by a parallel shift in plasma ACTH (28% lower on day 14 compared with non-pregnant levels). Moreover, while circadian rhythmicity in corticosterone was maintained up to day 14 of gestation, this was effectively lost by day 18. Overall, our data show that the central circadian clock undergoes marked adaptations throughout mouse pregnancy, changes that are likely to contribute to maternal physiological adaptations. Importantly, however, neither hypothalamic clock genes nor plasma ACTH levels appear to drive the marked increase in maternal corticosterone after mid-gestation.

DT Editorial Material
AB This issue exemplifies the types of articles that JABFM publishes to advance family medicine. We have articles on the implications of health system organizational structures. Three of these are international articles at the level of the national health system (1 from China) and systematic local health interventions (1 from Canada and 1 from Netherlands). Inside the United States, where there are more family physicians, there is less obesity, and designation as a Patient Centered Medical Home is related to increased rates of colorectal cancer screening. Review articles on common clinical topics discuss treatments that are changing (acne in pregnancy) or lack consensus (distal radial fractures). We have articles on making life easier in the office, such as for predicting Vitamin D levels, osteoporosis, and prediabetes in normal weight adults. There are articles to raise awareness of the "newest" testing or treatments, that is, auditory brainstem implants. "Reminder" articles highlight known entities that need to be reinforced to prevent over-/underdiagnosis or treatment, for example, "cotton fever." Another article discusses the increased risk for postoperative complications with sleep apnea. We also provide "thought" pieces, in this case about the terminology we are using to extend our concept of patient-centered medical homes.

AB Purpose Sleep disturbances such as insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, restless legs syndrome, habitual snoring, and excessive daytime sleepiness are frequent during pregnancy, and these have been linked to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.
   Methods A prospective observational study was performed in high-risk Indian pregnant women. We used modified Berlin questionnaire (MBQ), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group 2011 criteria, and Epworth sleepiness scale to diagnose various sleep disorders, such as symptomatic OSA, poor sleep quality and insomnia, RLS, and excessive daytime sleepiness, respectively, in successive trimesters of pregnancy. Outcome variables of interest were development of gestational hypertension (GH), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and cesarean delivery (CS); the Apgar scores; and low birth weight (LBW). The relationship between sleep disorders and outcomes was explored using logistic regression analysis. Results Outcome data were obtained in 209 deliveries. As compared to nonsnorers, women who reported snoring once, twice, and thrice or more had odds ratios for developing GH-4.0 (95 % CI 1.3-11.9), 1.5 (95 % CI 0.5-4.5), and 2.9 (95 % CI 1.0-8.2) and for undergoing CS-5.3 (95 % CI 1.7-16.3), 4.9 (95 % CI 1.8-13.1), and 5.1 (95 % CI 1.9-14.9), respectively. Pregnant women who were persistently positive on MBQ had increased odds for GH and CS.
   Conclusions Snoring and high-risk MBQ in pregnant women are strong risk factors for GH and CS. In view of the significant morbidity and health care costs, simple screening of pregnant women with questionnaires such as MBQ may have clinical utility.

AB Poor sleep quality during pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetric and neuropsychiatric outcomes. Despite its routine use as a sleep quality assessment scale among men and non-pregnant women, the psychometric properties of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) have not been assessed among US pregnant women. We sought to evaluate the construct validity and factor structure of the PSQI among 1488 pregnant women.
   A structured interview was used to collect information about demographics and sleep characteristics in early pregnancy. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were used to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Consistency indices, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA), correlations, and logistic regression procedures were used.
   The reliability coefficient, Cronbach's alpha for the PSQI items was 0.74. Results of the EFA showed that a rotated factor solution for the PSQI contained two factors with eigenvalues > 1.0 accounting for 52.8 % of the variance. The PSQI was significantly positively correlated with the PHQ-9 (r (s) = 0.48) and DASS-21 (r (s) = 0.42) total scores. Poor sleepers (PSQI global score > 5) had increased odds of experiencing depression (OR = 6.47; 95 % CI = 4.56-9.18), anxiety (OR = 3.59; 95 % CI = 2.45-5.26), and stress (OR = 4.37; 95 % CI = 2.88-6.65) demonstrating evidence of good construct validity. CFA results corroborated the two-factor structure finding from the EFA and yielded reassuring measures indicating goodness of fit (comparative fit index = 0.975) and accuracy (root mean square error of approximation = 0.035).
   The PSQI has good construct validity and reliability for assessing sleep quality among pregnant women.

AB Sleeping problems and fatigue in pregnancy are often accepted as a normal part of pregnancy; however, these conditions can be linked to serious consequences for both the mother and child. Despite established links between sleeping disturbance and a wide range of pregnancy complications, little is known about the health-care utilisation of women experiencing sleeping problems and fatigue. This study addresses the existing gap in the literature by examining cross-sectional data to identify health service utilisation patterns of pregnant women experiencing sleeping problems and/or tiredness or fatigue.
   In 2010, a sub-study of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health was conducted as a cross-sectional survey of 2445 women who had recently given birth. Associations between reported symptoms of sleeplessness and/or tiredness or fatigue and health service utilisation were determined using logistic regression analysis.
   During their pregnancy, 15.2 % of women experienced sleeping problems while 35.4 % experienced tiredness or fatigue. Women most commonly consulted with an obstetrician (n = 96) or a general practitioner (GP) (n = 74) for their tiredness or fatigue rather than a midwife (n = 56). A substantial number of women sought help from a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioner for sleeping problems (33 %) or tiredness/fatigue (28 %).
   Sleeping problems and/or tiredness or fatigue is reported by a reasonable percentage of pregnant women, and women obtain assistance from conventional and CAM practitioners for their symptoms, but not all seek help. Given the serious implications of untreated sleep- and fatigue-related symptoms for mother and baby, this area of research deserves and requires more attention.

AB Fetal maturation age assessment based on heart rate variability (HRV) is a predestinated tool in prenatal diagnosis. To date, almost linear maturation characteristic curves are used in univariate and multivariate models. Models using complex multivariate maturation characteristic curves are pending.
   To address this problem, we use Random Forest (RF) to assess fetal maturation age and compare RF with linear, multivariate age regression. We include previously developed HRV indices such as traditional time and frequency domain indices and complexity indices of multiple scales.
   We found that fetal maturation was best assessed by complexity indices of short scales and skewness in state-dependent datasets (quiet sleep, active sleep) as well as in state-independent recordings. Additionally, increasing fluctuation amplitude contributed to the model in the active sleep state. None of the traditional linear HRV parameters contributed to the RF models. Compared to linear, multivariate regression, the mean prediction of gestational age (GA) is more accurate with RF than in linear, multivariate regression (quiet state: R-2 = 0, 617 vs. R-2 = 0, 461, active state: R-2 = 0, 521 vs. R-2 = 0,436, state independent: R-2 = 0, 583 vs. R-2 = 0, 548).
   We conclude that classification and regression tree models such as RF methodology are appropriate for the evaluation of fetal maturation age. The decisive role of adjustments between different time scales of complexity may essentially extend previous analysis concepts mainly based on rhythms and univariate complexity indices. Those system characteristics may have implication for better understanding and accessibility of the maturating complex autonomic control and its disturbance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   What is the topic of this review? This review summarizes sex-dependent differences in the sympathetic responses to chemoreflex activation, with a focus on the role of circulating sex hormones on the sympathetic outcomes.
   What advances does it highlight? The importance of circulating sex hormones for the regulation of sympathetic nerve activity in humans has only recently begun to be elucidated, and few studies have examined this effect during chemoreflex regulation. We review recent studies indicating that changes in circulating sex hormones are associated with alterations to chemoreflex-driven increases in sympathetic activity and highlight those areas which require further study.
   Sex-dependent differences in baseline sympathetic nerve activity are established, but little information exists on the influence of sex on sympathetic activation during chemoreflex stimulation. In this article, we review the evidence for the effect of sex on chemoreflex-driven increases in sympathetic nerve activity. We also review recent studies which indicate that changes in circulating sex hormones, as initiated by the menstrual cycle and hormonal contraceptive use, elicit notable changes in the muscle sympathetic activation during chemoreflex stimulation.

AB This review summarizes the evidence concerning effects of night shift work on women's reproductive health, specifically difficulty in conceiving and miscarriage. We distinguish between fixed night shift and rotating night shift, as the population subgroups exposed, the social and biological mechanisms, and the magnitude of effects are likely to differ; of note, women working fixed night shift are known to have high tolerance for this schedule. We identified two relevant systematic reviews with meta-analyses and five additional studies. Night shift work may give rise to menstrual cycle disturbances, but effect sizes are imprecise. Endometriosis may be elevated in night shift workers, but evidence is only preliminary. Adequate data are lacking to assess associations between night shift work and infertility or time to pregnancy. The weight of evidence begins to point to working at night, whether in fixed or rotating shifts, as a risk factor for miscarriage. There are many methodological problems with this literature, with substantial variation in the definitions of night shift and schedule types making comparisons between studies difficult and pooling across studies questionable. Nevertheless, there appears to be grounds for caution and counselling where women have concerns about night shift work and their reproductive health.

AB Exogenous melatonin has been investigated as treatment for a number of medical and surgical diseases, demonstrating encouraging results. The aim of this review was to present and evaluate the literature concerning the possible adverse effects and safety of exogenous melatonin in humans. Furthermore, we provide recommendations concerning the possible risks of melatonin use in specific patient groups. In general, animal and human studies documented that short-term use of melatonin is safe, even in extreme doses. Only mild adverse effects, such as dizziness, headache, nausea and sleepiness have been reported. No studies have indicated that exogenous melatonin should induce any serious adverse effects. Similarly, randomized clinical studies indicate that long-term melatonin treatment causes only mild adverse effects comparable to placebo. Long-term safety of melatonin in children and adolescents, however, requires further investigation. Due to a lack of human studies, pregnant and breast-feeding women should not take exogenous melatonin at this moment.

AB Introduction: Perinatal major depressive disorder affects 20% of women, while perinatal anxiety affects 10% of women. Although pharmacological treatment has shown effectiveness, many pregnant women are concerned about potential adverse effects on the fetus, maternal-infant bonding, and child development. Approximately 38% of American adults use complementary and alternative medicine, including yoga and other mind-body strategies. Although complementary and alternative medicine has been less studied in the perinatal population, it potentially offers women and their providers alternatives to traditional medication for treatment of perinatal depression and anxiety. Thus, the purpose of this systematic review was to examine existing empirical literature on yoga and its effects on women's health and well-being during the perinatal period. Method: Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for systemic literature reviews, literature searches using relevant search terms were performed in four major electronic databases: CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. Thirteen publications met inclusion criteria. Results: Results indicated that yoga interventions are generally effective in reducing anxiety and depression in pregnant women. Discussion: The use of yoga in the perinatal period shows promise in improving mental health and well-being for women and infants. This review can inform future yoga intervention studies and clinical practice with the perinatal population.

AB Objectives: The current study investigated prospective associations between youth sleep problems across childhood and adolescence, as well as the relationship between chronic youth sleep problems and young adult health. Exploratory analyses investigated this sleep-health relationship in the context of several established risk factors, including youth depression and environmental stress.
   Design: This project is an extension of the Mater-University Study of Pregnancy, a longitudinal study that followed more than 7000 children across early development.
   Setting: Brisbane, Australia.
   Participants: Seven hundred ten mother-child dyads assessed from birth to age 20.
   Measurements: We used maternal report measures to assess the persistence of youth sleep problems. We used structural equation modeling to explore the relationship between chronic maternal-reported youth sleep problems and subjective reports of young adult health quality and to assess whether associations remained when other potential health risks were included in the model.
   Results: Path analyses revealed that sleep problems in early childhood predicted sleep problems in middle adolescence, which predicted sleep problems at age 20. Structural equation models showed that chronic youth sleep problems predicted youth health quality at age 20 (beta- .263, P < .001) over and above the effects of early adversity, chronic childhood illness, maternal depression, lifetime youth depression, and chronic youth stress.
   Conclusions: Chronic sleep problems can emerge in childhood and may contribute to negative health outcomes in young adulthood. Chronic youth sleep problems remain a significant predictor of poor health when tested against other known health risk factors, suggesting that sleep may be an important health intervention target.

AB This investigation was conducted to examine circadian and seasonal rhythms of heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) by means of hour-by-hour recordings over 24 h in a large population of non-lactating Holstein-Friesian pregnant cows [N = 56, summer (June July); N = 61, winter (November-December)]. Data were collected during a 5-day period from each animal. Besides parameters of cardiac autonomic function [the high-frequency (HF) component of HRV and the ratio between the low-frequency (LF) and the HF components (LF/HF ratio)], the RR triangular index and L-max were calculated. A clear circadian profile was observed for every parameter in summer. Heart rate elevated gradually with the course of the day from 7:00 to 17:00 o'clock and then slightly decreased from 18:00 to 6:00. Sympathovagal balance shifted towards sympathetic dominance during the daytime (increased LF/HF ratio), whereas parasympathetic activity was predominant during the night (increased HF). Lmax reflected a chaotic behavior of heart rate fluctuations during the afternoon in summer. Decreased values of RR triangular index indicated a sensitive period for cows between 14:00 and 16:00 o'clock in summer. During winter, except for the RR triangular (RRtri) index reflecting a high overall variability in R-R intervals between 12:00 and 23:00 o'clock, heart rate and HRV showed no periodicity over the 24-h period. The results suggest an impaired cardiac autonomic function during daytime in summer. HF, L-max. and RRtri index showed seasonal differences for both daytime and nighttime. Heart rate was higher in summer than in winter during the daytime, whereas the LF/HF ratio was higher in winter during the nighttime. Circadian and seasonal rhythms of cardiovascular function are presumably related to the differing temperature, and animal activity associated with summer and winter. As all of the investigated parameters are commonly used in bovine HRV research, these findings have practical implications for behavioral, physiological and welfare studies on dairy cattle.

AB The present study aimed to analyze the effects of sleep restriction (SR) during pregnancy in rats. The following three groups were studied: home cage (HC pregnant females remained in their home cage), Sham (females were placed in tanks similar to the SR group but with sawdust) and SR (females were submitted to the multiple platform method for 20 h per day from gestational days (GD) 14 to 20). Plasma corticosterone after 6 days of SR was not different among the groups. However, the relative adrenal weight was higher in the SR group compared with the HC group, which suggests possible stress impact SR during pregnancy reduces the body weight of the female but no changes in liver glycogen, cholesterol and triglycerides, and muscle glycogen were detected. On GD 20, the fetuses of the females submitted to SR exhibited increased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, which indicates that sleep restriction of mothers during the final week of gestation may affect neuronal growth factors in a fetal brain structure, in which active neurogenesis occurs during the deprivation period. However, no changes in the total reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cortex, hippocampus, or cerebellum of the fetuses were detected. SR females showed no major change in the maternal behavior, and the pups' preference for the mother's odor on postpartum day (PPD) 7 was not altered. On GD 20, the SR females exhibited increased plasma prolactin (PRL) and oxytocin (OT) compared with the HC and Sham groups. The negative outcomes of sleep restriction during delivery could be related, in part, to this hormonal imbalance. Sleep restriction during pregnancy induces different changes compared with the changes described in males and affects both the mother and offspring. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundMaternal depression has been associated with excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems, but the specificity of maternal depression, as compared with maternal anxiety remains unclear and manifest disorders prior to pregnancy have been widely neglected. In this prospective longitudinal study, the specific associations of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to, during and after pregnancy and infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems were investigated in the context of maternal parity.
   MethodsIn the Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) Study, n=306 primiparous and multiparous women were repeatedly interviewed from early pregnancy until 16months post partum with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women (CIDI-V) to assess DSM-IV anxiety and depressive disorders. Information on excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems was obtained from n=286 mothers during postpartum period via questionnaire and interview (Baby-DIPS).
   ResultsFindings from this study revealed syndrome-specific risk constellations for maternal anxiety and depressive disorders as early as prior to pregnancy: Excessive infant crying (10.1%) was specifically associated with maternal anxiety disorders, especially in infants of younger and lower educated first-time mothers. Feeding problems (36.4%) were predicted by maternal anxiety (and comorbid depressive) disorders in primiparous mothers and infants with lower birth weight. Infant sleeping problems (12.2%) were related to maternal depressive (and comorbid anxiety) disorders irrespective of maternal parity.
   ConclusionsPrimiparous mothers with anxiety disorders may be more prone to anxious misinterpretations of crying and feeding situations leading to an escalation of mother-infant interactions. The relation between maternal depressive and infant sleeping problems may be better explained by a transmission of unsettled maternal sleep to the fetus during pregnancy or a lack of daily structure and bedtime routine with the infant. Maternal disorders prior to pregnancy require more attention in research and clinical practice.

AB Background: Sleep deprivation during pregnancy is a serious public health problem as it can affect the health of pregnant women and newborns. However, it is not well studied whether sleep deprivation at different stages of pregnancy has similar effects on emotional and cognitive functions of the offspring, and if so, the potential cellular mechanisms also remain poorly understood.
   Methods: In the present study, the pregnant rats were subjected to sleep deprivation for 6 h per day by gentle handling during the first (gestational days 1-7), second (gestational days 8-14) and third trimester (gestational days 15-21) of pregnancy, respectively. The emotional and cognitive functions as well as hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) were tested in the offspring rats (postnatal days 42-56).
   Results: The offspring displayed impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory, and increased depressive-and anxiety-like behaviors. Quantification of BrdU-positive cells revealed that adult hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly reduced compared to control. Electrophysiological recording showed that maternal sleep deprivation impaired hippocampal CA1 LTP and reduced basal synaptic transmission, as reflected by a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.
   Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that maternal sleep deprivation at different stages of pregnancy disrupts the emotional and cognitive functions of the offspring that might be attributable to the suppression of hippocampal LTP and basal synaptic transmission.

AB Objective
   To examine the prevalence of snoring during pregnancy and its effects on key pregnancy outcomes.
   Methods
   Pregnant women were consecutively recruited in their first trimester. Habitual snoring was screened by using a questionnaire in the 1st and 3rd trimester, respectively. According to the time of snoring, participants were divided into pregnancy onset snorers, chronic snorers and non-snorers. Logistic regressions were performed to examine the associations between snoring and pregnancy outcomes.
   Results
   Of 3 079 pregnant women, 16.6% were habitual snorers, with 11.7% were pregnancy onset snorers and 4.9% were chronic snorers. After adjusting for potential confounders, chronic snorers were independently associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.09-2.53). Both pregnancy onset and chronic snorers were independently associated with placental adhesion (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.17-3.27, and RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.22-4.46, respectively). Pregnancy onset snorers were at higher risk of caesarean delivery (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.73) and having macrosomia (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05-2.27) and large for gestational age (LGA) (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.31-2.24) infants. In addition, being overweight or obese before pregnancy plays an important role in mediating snoring and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
   Conclusions
   Maternal snoring may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and being overweight or obese before pregnancy with snoring is remarkable for researchers. Further studies are still needed to confirm our results.

TI Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) Status in Pregnant Women: Associations

AB Mechanistic pathways linking maternal polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status with gestational length are poorly delineated. This study examined whether inflammation and sleep quality serve as mediators, focusing on the antiinflammatory.-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n3) and proinflammatory omega-6 arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n6). Pregnant women (n = 135) provided a blood sample and completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 20-27 weeks gestation. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid levels were determined by gas chromatography and serum inflammatory markers [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-a, IL-1 beta, and C-reactive protein] by electrochemiluminescence using high sensitivity kits. Both higher serum IL-8 (95% CI = 0.10,3.84) and poor sleep (95% CI = 0.03,0.28) served as significant mediators linking lower DHA: AA ratios with shorter gestation. Further, a serial mediation model moving from the DHA: AA ratio! sleep! IL-8! length of gestation was statistically significant (95% CI = 0.02, 0.79). These relationships remained after adjusting for depressive symptoms, age, BMI, income, race, and smoking. No interactions with race were observed in relation to length of gestation as a continuous variable. However, a significant interaction between race and the DHA: AA ratio in predicting preterm birth was observed (p = 0.049); among African Americans only, odds of preterm birth decreased as DHA: AA increased (p = 0.048). These data support a role for both inflammatory pathways and sleep quality in linking less optimal RBC PUFA status with shorter gestation in African American and European American women and suggest that African-Americans have greater risk for preterm birth in the context of a low DHA: AA ratio.

   POPULATION
AB Background: For a small but significant group, pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain may become persistent. While multiple factors may contribute to disability in this group, previous studies have not investigated sleep impairments, body perception or mindfulness as potential factors associated with disability post-partum.
   Objectives: To compare women experiencing no pain post-pregnancy with those experiencing pregnancy-related persistent lumbopelvic pain (either low-or high-level disability) across multiple biopsychosocial domains.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Methods: Participants completed questionnaires for thorough profiling of factors thought to be important in pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain. Specific measures were the Urinary Distress Inventory, Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale, Back Beliefs Questionnaire, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Coping Strategies Questionnaire, Pain Catastrophising Scale, The Fremantle Back Awareness Questionnaire and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale. Women where categorised into three groups; pain free (n = 26), mild disability (n = 12) and moderate disability (n = 12) (based on Oswestry Disability Index scores). Non-parametric group comparisons were used to compare groups across the profiling variables.
   Results: Differences were identified for kinesiophobia (p = 0.03), body perception (p = 0.02), sleep quantity (p < 0.01) and sleep adequacy (p = 0.02). Generally subjects in the moderate disability group had more negative findings for these variables.
   Conclusion: Disturbances in body-perception, sleep and elevated kinesiophobia were found in pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain subjects with moderate disability, factors previously linked to persistent low back pain. The cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow for identification of directional pathways between factors. The results support the consideration of these factors in the assessment and management of pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Pregnancy and postpartum are two critical and stressful periods. Despite the joy of motherhood, these periods are sometimes associated with important physiological and pathological changes such as sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality. This study aimed to determine the effect of orange peel essential oil on sleep quality after delivery.
   Methods: This triple-blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 96 postpartum women. Verified samples were assigned to intervention and control groups using randomized blocking. The intervention group received 10 drops of orange peel essential oil and the control group received 10 drops of placebo in a glass of water, three times a day, after each meal for 8 weeks. All participants filled out the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index before and after the intervention.
   Results There was no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of socio-demographic characteristics sleep quality score before intervention (p > 0.05). A significant improvement in sleep quality was observed in the group receiving orange peel essential oil compared with the control group at 8 weeks after delivery [adjusted mean difference: 5.0; 95% confidence interval: 3.9 to 6.1; p = 0.001]. Regarding the components of the sleep quality index, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups except for the daytime dysfunction component (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Orange peel essential oil has a positive effect in improving mothers' sleep quality in the postpartum period. However, further studies are needed on a more general population of women in order to decide on its use as an appropriate medication to use in clinical situations. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

   MODELS; DB75
AB Background
   Sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis [ HAT]) is a neglected tropical disease with limited treatment options that currently require parenteral administration. In previous studies, orally administered pafuramidine was well tolerated in healthy patients (for up to 21 days) and stage 1 HAT patients (for up to 10 days), and demonstrated efficacy comparable to pentamidine.
   Methods
   This was a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, active control study where 273 male and female patients with first stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense HAT were treated at six sites: one trypanosomiasis reference center in Angola, one hospital in South Sudan, and four hospitals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between August 2005 and September 2009 to support the registration of pafuramidine for treatment of first stage HAT in collaboration with the United States Food and Drug Administration. Patients were treated with either 100 mg of pafuramidine orally twice a day for 10 days or 4 mg/kg pentamidine intramuscularly once daily for 7 days to assess the efficacy and safety of pafuramidine versus pentamidine. Pregnant and lactating women as well as adolescents were included.
   The primary efficacy endpoint was the combined rate of clinical and parasitological cure at 12 months. The primary safety outcome was the frequency and severity of adverse events. The study was registered on the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform at www.clinicaltrials.gov with the number ISRCTN85534673.
   Findings/Conclusions
   The overall cure rate at 12 months was 89% in the pafuramidine group and 95% in the pentamidine group; pafuramidine was non-inferior to pentamidine as the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval did not exceed 15%. The safety profile of pafuramidine was superior to pentamidine; however, 3 patients in the pafuramidine group had glomerulonephritis or nephropathy approximately 8 weeks post-treatment. Two of these events were judged as possibly related to pafuramidine. Despite good tolerability observed in preceding studies, the development program for pafuramidine was discontinued due to delayed post-treatment toxicity.

AB The purpose of this descriptive study was to examine the associations of sleep hygiene and actigraphy measures of sleep with self-reported sleep quality in 197 pregnant women in northern Taiwan. Third-trimester pregnant women completed the Sleep Hygiene Practice Scale (SHPS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) as well as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and wore an actigraph for 7 consecutive days. Student's t-test was used to compare the SHPS scores and means as well as variability of actigraphy sleep variables between poor sleepers (i.e., PSQI global score > 5) and good sleepers (i.e., PSQI global score <= 5). Compared to good sleepers, poor sleepers reported significantly worse sleep hygiene, with higher SHPS scores and higher sleep schedule, arousal-related behavior, and sleep environment subscale scores. Poor sleepers had significantly greater intra-individual variability of sleep onset latency, total nighttime sleep, and wake after sleep onset than good sleepers. In stepwise linear regression, older maternal age (p - .01), fewer employment hours per week (p = .01), higher CES-D total score (p < .01), and higher SHPS arousal-related behavior subscale scores (p < .01) predicted self-reported global sleep quality. Findings support avoiding physically, physiologically, emotionally, or cognitively arousing activities before bedtime as a target for sleep-hygiene intervention in women during pregnancy.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effect of acupression at the H7 point on sleep quality during pregnancy. After oral consent had been obtained, the midwife invited the women claiming to have poor sleep quality and anxiety symptoms to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-1. Then, the same midwife, previously trained by an expert acupuncturist (I.N.), advised the women to put on the wrist overnight compression H7 Insomnia Control half an hour before going to bed and to take it off upon awakening, for 10 consecutive days and thereafter every odd day (active group). Women refusing to wear the device for low compliance toward acupression were considered as the control group. After 2 weeks, a second questionnaire evaluation was completed. In the active, but not in the control, group, a significant improvement of sleep quality was observed after H7 device application. The study suggests that H7 acupression applied for 2 weeks improves sleep quality in pregnant women. This preliminary result should serve to stimulate further studies on the long-term effects of acupression.

AB In preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, the sympathetic nerves are activated, leading to disrupted sleep. Melatonin, which transmits information to regulate the sleep-wake rhythm and other such biorhythms, has been implicated in insulin resistance, antioxidant behaviors, and metabolic syndrome. In addition, its reduced secretion increases the risk of hypertension and diabetes. The aim of this study was to elucidate the features of melatonin secretion, sleep quality, and sleep-wake rhythms in pregnant women with complications. Fifty-eight pregnant women with pregnancy complications (hypertensive or glucose metabolic disorders) and 40 healthy pregnant women completed questionnaires, including sleep logs and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), during the second to third trimesters. Their salivary melatonin levels were also measured. Pregnant women with complications had significantly lower morning (p < 0.001), daytime (p < 0.01), evening (p < 0.001), night (p < 0.01), daily mean (p < 0.001), peak (p < 0.001), and bottom (p < 0.01) melatonin values than healthy pregnant women. Pregnant women with complications also had significantly smaller melatonin amplitudes than healthy pregnant women (p < 0.001). Among pregnant women with complications, the duration (p < 0.05) and frequency (p < 0.01) of wake after sleep-onset were significantly greater in the poor sleep group than in the favorable sleep group which was divided by PSQI cutoff value. Pregnant women with hypertensive or glucose metabolic disorder complications had smaller circadian variation in salivary melatonin secretion, and their values were lower throughout the day than healthy pregnant women.

AB Purpose: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a commonly occurring neurologic disorder that affects up to one third of women during pregnancy. RLS has been associated with increased sympathetic tone in the nonpregnant population. We examined whether a RLS surrogate is associated with a higher prevalence of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.
   Methods: Data were analyzed from a cross-sectional survey of 1000 women interviewed soon after delivery by using an RLS surrogate question. Women were asked how frequently (0 = none, 1 -= rarely [<1 time/week], 2 = sometimes [1-2 times/week], 3 = frequently [3-4 times/week], and 4 = always [5-7 times/week]) they had "experienced jumpy or jerky leg movements" in the last 3 months of pregnancy. Clinical charts were reviewed to obtain relevant demographic and clinical data, including the presence of gestational hypertensive disorders and neonatal outcomes at birth. Subjects who "always" experienced RLS were compared with subjects experiencing symptoms less frequently or not at all with respect to prevalence of gestational hypertensive disorder.
   Findings: The mean ([SD]) age, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), and BMI at delivery were 29.0 (6.1) years, 26.1 (6.2) kg/m(2), and 32.0 (6.3) kg/m(2), respectively. The overall prevalence of the RLS surrogate (jumpy or jerky leg movements) was 35.5% with the following distribution on a Likert scale: score 1 = 6.4%; score 2 = 10.2%; score 3 = 8.1%; and score 4 = 10.8%. Chronic hypertension was present in 2.1%, pregnancy-induced hypertension in 9.5%, and preeclampsia in 4.5% of respondents. Subjects who reported "always" having sensations of jumpy or jerky legs were more likely to have gestational hypertensive disorders compared with those who reported less frequent occurrence of the symptoms. Adjusted odds ratios were 3.74 (95% CI, 1.31-10.72; P = 0.014) for chronic hypertension; 1.26 (95% CI, 0.65-2.46; P = 0.487) for pregnancy-induced hypertension; and 2.15 (95% CI, 0.97-4.75; P = 0.060) for preeclampsia. There was a significant association between leg movement score and neonatal birth weight (coefficient, -149.5 g [95% CI, 276.9 to -22.5]; P = 0.005) and gestational age at birth (-0.7 week [95 % CI, 1.1 to -0.2]; P = 0.021) that persisted after adjusting for preeclampsia, diabetes, and smoking.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine whether adopted children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differ from the general ASD population in terms of diagnosis, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, sleep problems, and medications.
   METHODS: We studied 163 adoptees in the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (ATN) in comparison with 5624 nonadopted ATN participants (aged 1.5-17.6 years; mean [SD] = 6.2 [3.4] years). Gender, age, race, ethnicity, IQ, and categorical Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, ASD diagnosis were tested for differences by group (adopted versus nonadopted) by using independent-samples t tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Logistic or linear regression models were used to examine the association between adoption status and several outcome variables, after controlling for covariates.
   RESULTS: After controlling for demographics and diagnosis, there were significant differences in group characteristics, including greater propensity for externalizing behavior (P < .001), internalizing behavior (P = .001), and sleep problems (P < .001) in the adopted population. Adoptees were also prescribed psychotropic medications (P < .001) more often than the nonadoptees. Adoptees received a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified significantly more frequently than controls (odds ratio = 1.8; CI = 1.3-2.5; P < .001), despite no significant difference in symptoms on standardized measures.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the population of adopted children with ASD differs from the general ASD population both with regard to diagnostic subtype and co-occurring behavioral problems. Future research should evaluate the contributions of specific factors associated with adoption such as biological family history, pregnancy history, early childhood experience, and age at adoption.

AB Aims and objectives. This study examined the effects of auricular acupressure therapy on women with postpartum insomnia.
   Background. Postpartum women generally have poor sleep quality because of frequent night-time breastfeeding during the first month after giving birth.
   Design. A one-group pretest/post-test quasi-experiment was conducted.
   Methods. A convenience sampling method was used to recruit participants at a postpartum centre (doing-the-month centre) in Northern Taiwan, from January 2014-July 2014. Thirty women with postpartum insomnia received auricular acupressure therapy on one auricular point (Shenmen point pressing) four times a day for 14 days. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess sleep quality before and after the 14-day treatment.
   Results. After the 14-day auricular acupressure treatment, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index total scores of the women decreased from 8.7 (pretest) to 5.57 (post-test, 36% reduction). Scores on the subscales of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, including sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration and sleep disturbance, also statistically improved (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions. Hormone changes and frequent breastfeeding were identified as characteristics that may exacerbate poor sleep quality of postpartum women, for whom the auricular acupressure intervention may effectively improve sleep quality.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Auricular acupressure can be an alternative complementary therapy to aid postpartum women with insomnia in improving sleep quality.

AB Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate the health effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) among female operators of plastic welding machines.Methods:We examined 180 female operators in shoe factories as the exposed group, and 349 female workers from nearby supermarkets as the unexposed group.Results:The mean radiation levels in the vicinity of the welding machines ranged from 51.3 to 368.9V/m. The prevalence of neurovegetative symptoms increased with higher EMFs exposures (P<0.05). The prevalence of menstrual disorder was 12.0% in the unexposed group, but was 26.8% and 33.8% in low and high-exposure groups, respectively (P<0.01). Exposure-response relationships were found between cumulate exposure and neurovegetative symptoms and menstrual disorder (P<0.05). Serum progesterone (P-4) was significantly lower in the exposed groups (P<0.01).Conclusions:EMFs exposure was associated with adverse health effects, including neurovegetative symptoms, menstrual disorder, and low level of P-4.

AB Objectives To examine: (1) the prevalence and characteristics of bed-sharing among non-Hispanic Black and White infants in Georgia, and (2) differences in bed-sharing and sleep position behaviors prior to and after the American Academy of Pediatrics' 2005 recommendations against bed-sharing. Methods Georgia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data were obtained from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Analysis was guided by the socioecological model levels of: Infant, Maternal, Family, and Community/Society within the context of race. Data from 2004 to 2011 were analyzed to address the first objective and from 2000 to 2004 and 2006 to 2011 to address the second objective. Rao-Scott Chi square tests and backward selection unconditional logistic regression models for weighted data were built separately by race; odds ratios (OR) and 95 % Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results A total of 6595 (3528 Black and 3067 White) cases were analyzed between 2004 and 2011. Significantly more Black mothers (81.9 %) reported "ever" bed-sharing compared to White mothers (56 %), p < 0.001. Logistic regression results indicated that the most parsimonious model included variables from all socioecological levels. For Blacks, the final model included infant age, pregnancy intention, number of dependents, and use of Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Services. For Whites, the final model included infant age, maternal age, financial stress, partner-related stress, and WIC. When comparing the period 2000-2004 to 2006-2011, a total of 10,015 (5373 Black and 4642 White cases) were analyzed. A significant decrease in bedsharing was found for both Blacks and Whites; rates of non-supine sleep position decreased significantly for Blacks but not Whites. Conclusions for Practice Continued high rates of bed-sharing and non-supine sleep position for both Blacks and Whites demonstrate an ongoing need for safe infant sleep messaging. Risk profiles for Black and White mothers differed, suggesting the importance of tailored messaging. Specific research and practice implications are identified and described.

AB Objective Greater acculturation is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in Mexican-American women, but the mechanisms by which acculturation influences perinatal outcomes are unclear. Pregnant acculturated Mexican-American women are more likely to engage in unhealthy prenatal behaviors relative to those less acculturated, including poor sleep. As sleep disruptions are associated with acculturation and negative perinatal outcomes, particularly maternal depression, alterations in sleep may adversely affect pregnant Mexican-American women. Methods Sixty pregnant women of Mexican descent completed surveys about sleep, acculturation, depressive symptoms and potential protective factor of social support. Results Acculturation, but not social support, significantly predicted increased sleep disruptions as well as overall feeling less refreshed upon waking across pregnancy. Moderation analysis indicated that more acculturated women who took longer to fall asleep reported increased depressive symptoms. Feeling refreshed upon waking also mediated the relationship between increased acculturation and elevated maternal depressive symptoms. Conclusions Acculturation and altered sleep contribute to greater risk in Mexican-American women for maternal depressive symptoms in the perinatal period. These findings have implications for prevention and treatment of maternal mental health disorders, which may adversely affect perinatal outcomes in the vulnerable Mexican-American population.

AB BACKGROUND: Exposure to traffic noise has been associated with adverse effects on neuropsychological outcomes in children, but findings with regard to behavioral problems are inconsistent.
   OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether residential road traffic noise exposure is associated with -behavioral problems in 7-year-old children.
   METHODS: We identified 46,940 children from the Danish National Birth Cohort with complete information on behavioral problems at 7 years of age and complete address history from conception to 7 years of age. Road traffic noise (L-den) was modeled at all present and historical addresses. Behavioral problems were assessed by the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Associations between pregnancy and childhood exposure to noise and behavioral problems were analyzed by multinomial or logistic regression and adjusted for potential confounders.
   RESULTS: A 10-dB increase in average time-weighted road traffic noise exposure from birth to 7 years of age was associated with a 7% increase (95% CI: 1.00, 1.14) in abnormal versus normal total difficulties scores; 5% (95% CI: 1.00, 1.10) and 9% (95% CI: 1.03, 1.18) increases in borderline and abnormal hyperactivity/inattention subscale scores, respectively; and 5% (95% CI: 0.98, 1.14) and 6% (95% CI: 0.99, 1.12) increases in abnormal conduct problem and peer relationship problem subscale scores, respectively. Exposure to road traffic noise during pregnancy was not associated with child behavioral problems at 7 years of age.
   CONCLUSIONS: Residential road traffic noise in early childhood may be associated with behavioral problems, particularly hyperactivity/inattention symptoms.

AB Background: Findings from prior research into the effect of feeding methods on infant sleep are inconsistent. The objectives of this study were to examine infants' sleep patterns by feeding methods and sleep arrangement from birth to eight months old.
   Methods: This longitudinal cohort study enrolled 524 pregnant women at 34-41 weeks of gestation and their infants after delivery in 2006 and followed up until eight months postpartum. The study subjects were recruited from nine women and children hospitals in nine cities in China (Beijing, Chongqing, Wuhan, Changsha, Nanning, Xiamen, Xi'an, Jinan, and Hailin). Participating infants were followed up weekly during the first month and monthly from the second to the eighth month after birth. Twenty-four hour sleep diaries recording infants' sleeping and feeding methods were administered based on caregiver's self-report. Multivariable mixed growth curve models were fitted to estimate the effects of feeding methods and sleep arrangement on infants' sleep patterns over time, controlling for maternal and paternal age, maternal and paternal education level, household income, supplementation of complementary food, and infant birth weight and length.
   Results: Exclusively formula fed infants had the greatest sleep percentage/24 h, followed by exclusively breast milk fed infants and partially breast milk fed infants (P<0.01). Night waking followed a similar pattern. However, the differences in sleep percentage and night waking frequency between exclusively formula and exclusively breast milk fed infants weakened over time as infants developed. In addition, compared to infants with bed-sharing sleep arrangement, those with room sharing sleep arrangement had greater daytime and 24-hour infant sleep percentage, whereas those with sleeping alone sleep arrangement had greater nighttime sleep percentage.
   Conclusions: Our data based on caregiver's self report suggested that partial breastfeeding and bed sharing may be associated with less sleep in infants. Health care professionals need to work with parents of newborns to develop coping strategies that will help prevent early weaning of breastfeeding.

AB Depressive and fatigue symptoms are common health concerns for women in the postnatal period. Few studies have sought to investigate the role of fatigue in the development and maintenance of depressive symptoms. The aim of this paper was to examine the relationship between depressive symptoms and fatigue over the course of the first 4 years postpartum, in particular focusing on the extent to which fatigue at earlier time points predicted later depressive symptoms and vice versa. Data from over 1000 women participating in a longitudinal study of Australian women's physical and psychological health and recovery after childbirth were used. An autoregressive cross-lagged panel model was tested to assess the mutual influences of fatigue and depressive symptoms across five time points at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months postpartum, and at 4 years postpartum. A complex bidirectional relationship between fatigue and depressive symptoms from 3 months to 4 years postpartum was observed, where fatigue at earlier time points predicted depressive symptoms at later time points, and vice versa. The findings of this study suggest interventions targeting the prevention and management of fatigue may also confer some benefit in improving or preventing the development of depression symptoms in the early parenting period.

AB The aims of this paper are to study the associations between objective and subjective sleep in pregnant women, to examine which specific aspects of women's sleep are associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and to test the moderating role of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the relations between objective and subjective sleep. The sample included 148 pregnant women. Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy for five nights at the participants' home, and subjective sleep was measured with the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale and anxiety symptoms with the Beck anxiety inventory. Significant associations were found between the subjective sleep measures and the depressive and anxiety scores, but there were no significant associations between actigraphic sleep measures and the depressive and anxiety scores. Depressive and anxiety scores emerged as significant moderators of the links between objective and subjective sleep. The findings suggest that emotional distress (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms severity) during pregnancy is associated with subjective sleep disturbances but not with objective sleep disturbances. Importantly, only among women with higher levels of emotional distress was subjective sleep quality associated with objective sleep quality. These findings may suggest that women with higher levels of emotional distress are not necessarily biased in their perception of sleep quality. However, they may perceive fragmented sleep as more detrimental to their wellbeing.

AB This article considers whether there is a parental obligation to comply with child health advice which is aimed at the general population and grounded in population-based research. Drawing upon the concept of role obligations, I argue that there is a temptation to use child health advice as a set of rules to which parents are morally obligated to comply, but that this temptation should be resisted. Using the case of Safe Sleep recommendations, designed to reduce the risk of sleep-related infant deaths, I present three reasons for doubting that parents are obligated, as a matter of course, to comply with child health advice. I suggest that, rather than compliance, deliberation about child health advice is obligatory, and that parents should have reasons for not following credible child health advice.

AB ObjectiveThe Lifestyle Interventions for Expectant Moms (LIFE-Moms) Consortium is designed to determine, in pregnant women with overweight or obesity, whether various behavioral and lifestyle interventions reduce excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and subsequent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and obesity in offspring. The design and planning process of the LIFE-Moms Consortium is described.
   MethodsThe LIFE-Moms Consortium is a collaboration among seven clinical centers, a Research Coordinating Unit, and the NIH designed to support each clinical center's conduct of a separate trial of a unique intervention. Specific common measures, procedures, and eligibility criteria are consistent across the seven trials allowing data to be combined in exploratory analyses and/or compared readily.
   ResultsNumerous committees and working groups were created to define common measures and outcomes during pregnancy and through 1 year postpartum, develop Consortium policies, and oversee progress of the trials. The primary outcome for the Consortium is excessive GWG. Secondary outcomes include maternal, neonatal, and infant anthropometric measures, physical activity, sleep, and complications of pregnancy and delivery.
   ConclusionsA multi-center consortium of independent, lifestyle interventions with common measures and outcomes may enhance the ability to identify promising interventions for improving outcomes in pregnant women and their offspring.

AB Objective: To explore the direct measure of EEG amplitude (range EEG, rEEG) for detection of interburst intervals (IBIs) and bursts in neonates.
   Methods: Previously described 177 two-channel EEG recordings 3-6 h long from 26 preterm infants (median gestational age of 26 weeks) at 23-38 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) without major abnormalities were used to test four definitions of IBI detection algorithms with various settings of the parameters.
   Results: As the basis for all four algorithms we developed the aggregation of rEEG signal over the channels by taking its maximum, and method of EEG trace selection at different phases of sleep-wake cycle (with different degree of discontinuity). The two less restrictive algorithms - with one and two amplitude thresholds -turned to be the most promising definitions. There were enough IBI detections for analysis, with no substantial difference in mean and maximum values of intervals. The longest IBI were measured at the location of greater discontinuity. Values of bursts and IBI indices as well as association with PMA were close to the published normative values derived manually.
   Conclusions: rEEG as a direct measure of EEG amplitude can be used for detection of bursts and IBI.
   Significance: The automatic measurement of IBI based on rEEG provides a basis for improvements in neonatal brain monitoring. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of chamomile tea on sleep quality, fatigue and depression in postpartum women.
   Background. Sleep quality is a significant issue for postnatal women. Chamomile is widely used as a folk remedy for its presumed sedative-hypnotic effects.
   Design. A pretest-post-test randomized controlled trial was used.
   Methods. A total of 80 Taiwanese postnatal women with poor sleep quality (Postpartum Sleep Quality Scale; PSQS score. 16) were recruited from November 2012-August 2013. They were systematically assigned, with a random start, to either the experimental group (n = 40) or the control group (n = 40). The participants in the experimental group were instructed to drink chamomile tea for a period of 2 weeks. The participants in the control group received regular postpartum care only. The PSQS, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Postpartum Fatigue Scale were used to assess outcomes. Two-sample t-tests were used to examine the mean differences in outcome variables between the two groups.
   Results. Compared with the control group, the experimental group demonstrated significantly lower scores of physical-symptoms-related sleep inefficiency (t = - 2.482, P = 0.015) and the symptoms of depression (t = -2.372, P = 0.020). However, the scores for all three instruments were similar for both groups at 4-week post-test, suggesting that the positive effects of chamomile tea were limited to the immediate term.
   Conclusion. Chamomile tea may be recommended to postpartum women as a supplementary approach to alleviating depression and sleep quality problems.

AB ObjectivesThe objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a health coaching (HC) intervention designed to prevent excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), and promote positive psychosocial and motivational outcomes in comparison with an Education Alone (EA) group.
   DesignRandomized-controlled trial.
   MethodsTwo hundred and sixty-one women who were <18weeks pregnant consented to take part. Those allocated to the HC group received a tailored HC intervention delivered by a Health Coach, whilst those in the EA group attended two education sessions. Women completed measures, including motivation, psychosocial variables, sleep quality, and knowledge, beliefs and expectations concerning GWG, at 15weeks of gestation (Time 1) and 33weeks of gestation (Time 2). Post-birth data were also collected at 2months post-partum (Time 3).
   ResultsThere was no intervention effect in relation to weight gained during pregnancy, rate of excessive GWG or birth outcomes. The only differences between HC and EA women were higher readiness (b=0.29, 95% CIs=0.03-0.55, p<.05) and the importance to achieve a healthy GWG (b=0.27, 95% CIs=0.02-0.52, p<.05), improved sleep quality (b=-0.22, 95% CIs=-0.44 to -0.03, p<.05), and increased knowledge for an appropriate amount of GWG that would be best for their baby's health (b=-1.75, 95% CI=-3.26 to -0.24, p<.05) reported by the HC at Time 2.
   ConclusionsWhilst the HC intervention was not successful in preventing excessive GWG, several implications for the design of future GWG interventions were identified, including the burden of the intervention commitment and the use of weight monitoring.

AB The paradigm of chronobiology is based almost wholly upon the daily biological clock, or circadian rhythm, which has been the focus of intense molecular, cellular, pharmacological, and behavioral, research. However, the circadian rhythm does not explain biological timings related to fundamental aspects of life history such as rates of tissue/organ/body size development and control of the timing of life stages such as gestation length, age at maturity, and lifespan. This suggests that another biological timing mechanism is at work. Here we focus on a "many days" (multidien) chronobiological period first observed as enigmatic recurring growth lines in developing mammalian tooth enamel that is strongly associate with all adult tissue, organ, and body masses as well as life history attributes such as gestation length, age at maturity, weaning, and lifespan, particularly among the well studied primates. Yet, knowledge of the biological factors regulating the patterning of mammalian life, such as the development of body size and life history structure, does not exist. To identify underlying molecular mechanisms we performed metabolome and genome analyses from blood plasma in domestic pigs. We show that blood plasma metabolites and small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) drawn from 33 domestic pigs over a two-week period strongly oscillate on a 5-day multidien rhythm, as does the pig enamel rhythm. Metabolomics and genomics pathway analyses actually reveal two 5-day rhythms, one related to growth in which biological functions include cell proliferation, apoptosis, and transcription regulation/protein synthesis, and another 5-day rhythm related to degradative pathways that follows three days later. Our results provide experimental confirmation of a 5-day multidien rhythm in the domestic pig linking the periodic growth of enamel with oscillations of the metabolome and genome. This association reveals a new class of chronobiological rhythm and a snapshot of the biological bases that regulate mammalian growth, body size, and life history.

AB Personality may influence sleep in perinatal women. A follow-up study was conducted among 3,752 pregnant, then postpartum women at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. The Big Five personality dimensions were measured by the Mini-International Personality Item Pool in week 17 of pregnancy. Insomnia was measured by the Bergen Insomnia Scale in pregnancy week 32 and 8 weeks postpartum, along with self-reported sleep times. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale measured depression, and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist measured anxiety. Adjusted for current anxiety, depression, and demographic variables, the personality traits Neuroticism and Agreeableness were associated with insomnia in pregnancy. No personality traits were associated with postpartum insomnia. Extraversion was associated with longer postpartum sleep duration and better sleep efficiency, and Agreeableness with shorter sleep duration.

AB INTRODUCTION: Pain in childbirth and strategies for relieving it have been a subject of interest to researchers for many years. The use of cold (cryotherapy), as a pain relief technique generally, is quite well known and studied. However, few studies have addressed the use of cryotherapy as a strategy for relieving the pain of childbirth.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of cryotherapy in relieving childbirth pain.
   METHOD: Pilot intervention study using prospective data in a single intervention group, the outcome being the pain relief in women in labor. The sample comprised 36 parturients at the Hospital Maternidade Carmela Dutra, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Cryotherapy was applied to the parturients' thoracolumbar region at cervical dilation of 5, 7, and/or 9 cm, using an icepack belt. In all, 48 applications were made. The responses regarding the action of cryotherapy on pain were recorded on a specific form. The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was used. Following a form, the parturients' behavior during the application of cryotherapy was also observed.
   RESULTS: It was found that 91.67% (outcome) of the women reported pain relief and better conditions in which to experience childbirth. The behavior of 75% of the women in labor was calm and participatory; some slept (5.56%), others took short naps (19.44%).
   CONCLUSION: Cryotherapy proved effective in relieving pain in childbirth. Because characteristically, cryotherapy does not interfere in the physiological process of childbirth, it can be used in care for women in labor.

AB Poor sleep quality is one of the most common complaints in pregnancy, which can lead to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Therefore, counseling with pregnant women to use non-pharmacological methods such as music therapy appears to be helpful. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of music therapy counseling on sleep quality in pregnancy. This quasi-experimental study was conducted among 88 pregnant women, which were allocated randomly into two forty four-member groups of intervention and control in Hamadan city, Iran, 2015. The questionnaire used in this study was Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Two counseling sessions for using music therapy were held for experimental group. They were asked to listen to a calm music CD for 4 weeks, every night for 45 minutes. Then both groups were evaluated after 4 weeks. Data were analyzed with SPSS 16, by using chi-square, paired t-test and independent t-test. Data analysis showed that no significant differences had been found in component's scores of sleep quality in the control group before and after the intervention(P>0.05) except the fifth component; the fifth component score significantly increased (P=0.03). In the experimental group, there was a significant decrease in component scores of sleep quality (except fifth component) and total sleep quality score after the intervention. But the fifth component did not change significantly after the intervention. Also the comparison of the two groups by using Independent t-test showed a statistically significant difference between the total sleep quality score, first component (subjective sleep quality), second component (sleep latency), and seventh component (daily function disorder) after intervention between two groups (P<0.001). Counseling with pregnant women to use music therapy can have an effective role in improving their sleep quality in pregnancy.

ID GENETIC-HETEROGENEITY; PHENOTYPE; CBP
AB Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, broad thumbs and halluces, growth retardation, and a variable degree of cognitive impairment. CREBBP is the major causative gene and mutations in EP300 are the cause of RTS in a minority of patients. In this study, 17 patients with a clinical diagnosis of RTS were investigated with direct sequencing, MLPA, and array-CGH in search for mutations in these two genes. Eleven patients (64.7%) had disease-causing point mutations or a deletion in CREBBP and in one patient (5.9%) a causal de novo frameshift mutation in EP300 was identified. This patient had broad thumbs, mild intellectual disability, and autism. In addition, an inherited missense mutation of uncertain clinical significance was identified in EP300 in one patient and his healthy father, and three patients had intronic nucleotide changes of uncertain clinical significance in CREBBP. Snoring and sleep apnea were common in both groups and four of the patients' mothers had preeclampsia during pregnancy. Importantly, difficulties associated with anesthesia were frequently reported and included delayed or complicated emergency in 53.3% of patients.

AB Aim. The childbirth constitutes a significant event in a woman's life and in the marital/couple dyad. The changes which follow childbirth require re-organization of previous coping styles and development of new methods of adaptation, which proves difficult. The current study evaluated to what extent the development of postpartum depression symptoms in new mothers was associated with their level of satisfaction in marital relationship.
   Material and methods. The study included 100 women in their first month after delivery. The women completed questionnaires regarding postpartum depression (Postpartum Depression Screening Scale) and marital relationship quality (Marital Compatibility Questionnaire).
   Results. There was a significant correlation between the level of postpartum depression and relationship quality. A greater severity of postpartum depression symptoms (sleeping/eating disturbances, anxiety/insecurity, emotional lability, mental confusion, loss of self, guilt/shame, suicidal thoughts) occurred in women who were less satisfied with their relationship, i.e., those who experienced a decreased level of intimacy, self-fulfillment and partner similarity, as well as a deeper sense of disillusionment. Women who declared deeper satisfaction with their relationship displayed a greater sense of mental well-being. No correlation was found between the occurrence of postpartum depression and socio-demographic factors (age, education level, place of residence) and factors associated with the subjects' childbearing history (number of children, number of pregnancies, history of miscarriage, family planning, prior diagnosis of depression, type of delivery, newborn's condition following birth, infant feeding method).
   Conclusions. Patients dissatisfied with the quality of their marital relationship experienced an increased severity of postpartum depression symptoms. Greater satisfaction with relationship quality was expressed by women in formalized relaztionships.

AB The comparative effects on blood ejection and perfusion between supine and elevated supine postures with upper body elevations were investigated in this study. Blood ejection and perfusion were measured by electrical bioimpedance and laser Doppler flowmetry techniques respectively in normal human subjects. Using hardware and software, electrical bioimpedance based blood ejection from heart were calculated in different supine postures (normal and elevated). Skin blood perfusions were also measured by laser Doppler flowmetry technique in all cases. At first, data recordings were performed in normal supine posture (upper body elevated by 0(o)). Data recordings were done also when upper body elevations were sequentially increased to 15(o), 30(o), and 45(o). Changes in Blood ejection and perfusion were significant when upper body elevations were increased to a higher angle. Results showed highest blood ejection and perfusion in normal supine posture or elevated supine posture (30(o) elevation only) for most of the subjects. Optimum blood ejection and perfusion are desirable for better performance in blood circulation as well as to meet body's metabolic needs. It is recommended highly to sleep in supine posture with no elevation or 30(o) elevated supine posture only if the subject prefers to sleep in some elevation.

AB Objective: To investigate the relationship between the level of serum cystatin C (s-CC) and reverse-dipper blood pressure (BP) pattern.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Single centre.
   Participants: A total of 718 hypertensive patients were eventually recruited from cardiac clinics between 2012 and 2014 in the Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University. They were diagnosed as essential hypertension according to their casual office records of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Patients were excluded if they were <18 or >90 years old, under antihypertensive treatment, night workers, suffering from acute stroke or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, diagnosed as secondary hypertension, sleep apnoea or other sleep disorders, renal failure, cardiac failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, women during pregnancy or intolerant to the ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM).
   Measurement: The selected patients were evaluated with 24 hours ABPM. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected to evaluate the s-CC levels by ELISA.
   Methods: The distribution of hypertensive patients with different levels of s-CC among each circadian BP pattern group was analysed using analysis of variance. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the relationship between the relevant variables and ABPM results.
   Results: S-CC level in reverse-dipper group (1.19 +/- 0.53 mg/L) was increased significantly when compared with dipper group (1.06 +/- 0.36 mg/L) (p=0.021). In addition, after multinomial logistic regression analysis, s-CC (OR 1.717; 95% CI 1.033 to 2.854; p=0.037) and diabetes (OR 2.313; 95% CI 1.401 to 3.821; p=0.01) were significantly different between the reverse-dipper group and dipper group. On the other hand, the decline rate of nocturnal SBP (r=-0.117; p=0.002) and DBP (r=-0.089; p=0.018) was negatively correlated with the s-CC level.
   Conclusions: The s-CC level was significantly higher in the reverse-dipper group than the dipper group and that s-CC was associated with the reverse-dipper pattern of BP examined with 24 hour ABPM.

AB Objective: To investigate whether the circadian rhythm disruption following the transition into and out of daylight saving time (DST) is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous delivery.
   Design: We compared the number of spontaneous deliveries in the Swedish Medical Birth Register during the week after the change to and the week after the change from DST (exposure periods) with the average number of spontaneous deliveries in the control period, defined as the week before and the week after each exposure period.
   Setting: Sweden, 1993-2006.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: The primary outcomes were the weekly and the daily number of spontaneous deliveries in the exposure and the control periods. In secondary analyses we also compared the mean length of pregnancy of the women with spontaneous deliveries in the exposure and control periods.
   Results: The number of deliveries during the week after the transition into or out of DST was similar to that in the comparison period (18 519 observed vs 18 434 expected in case of the spring shift and 19 073 observed vs 19 122 expected in case of the autumn shift); the corresponding incidence ratio and 95% CIs were 1.005 (0.990 to 1.019) and 0.997 (0.983 to 1.012), respectively. There were no differences in the length of gestation of the deliveries in the exposure and the control periods.
   Conclusions: Our results do not support the hypothesis that a minor circadian rhythm disruption is associated with an increased short-term risk of spontaneous delivery.

TI Protective factors for child development at age 2 in the presence of

AB Objective: To identify the combination of factors most protective of developmental delay at age 2 among children exposed to poor maternal mental health.
   Design: Observational cohort study.
   Setting: Pregnant women were recruited from primary healthcare offices, the public health laboratory service and community posters in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
   Participants: 1596 mother-child dyads who participated in the All Our Babies study and who completed a follow-up questionnaire when their child was 2 years old. Among participants who completed the 2-year questionnaire and had complete mental health data (n=1146), 305 women (27%) were classified as high maternal mental health risk.
   Primary measures: Child development at age 2 was described and a resilience analysis was performed among a subgroup of families at maternal mental health risk. The primary outcome was child development problems. Protective factors were identified among families at risk, defined as maternal mental health risk, a composite measure created from participants' responses to mental health life course questions and standardised mental health measures.
   Results: At age 2, 18% of children were classified as having development problems, 15% with behavioural problems and 13% with delayed social-emotional competencies. Among children living in a family with maternal mental health risk, protective factors against development problems included higher social support, higher optimism, more relationship happiness, less difficulty balancing work and family responsibilities, limiting the child's screen time to <1 hour per day and the child being able to fall asleep in <30 min and sleeping through the night by age 2.
   Conclusions: Among families where the mother has poor mental health, public health and early intervention strategies that support interpersonal relationships, social support, optimism, work-life balance, limiting children's screen time and establishing good sleep habits in the child's first 2 years show promise to positively influence early child development.

AB Spontaneous startle represents a complex motor pattern, consisting of sudden and jerky movements, which typically occurs during quiet sleep in fullterm and preterm neonates. It has been studied as an endogenous behavior by focusing on its potential contribution to an early diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunctions. This paper aims to develop and validate an automated and non-invasive method for inferring spontaneous startles in preterm neonates. Such inference relies on measurements gathered via a hypo-allergenic pad containing a matrix of networked sensors able to measure pressure over time. The measurements gathered by sensors are processed to determine spatiotemporal features allowing to infer spontaneous startles and discriminate them from other behaviors, as well as to identify anomalies and atypical patterns possibly related to CNS issues. Preliminary results based on measurements will be presented, showing the potential benefits of the proposed method in spontaneous startle recognition.

AB Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare, severe, chronic, life-threatening disease with multiorgan involvement that requires optimal multidisciplinary care to normalize both prognosis and quality of life. In this article, each key team member of all the medical disciplines of a multidisciplinary health care team at the Hamburg Marfan center gives a personal account of his or her contribution in the management of patients with MFS. The authors show how, with the support of health care managers, key team members organize themselves in an organizational structure to create a common meaning, to maximize therapeutic success for patients with MFS. First, we show how the initiative and collaboration of patient representatives, scientists, and physicians resulted in the foundation of Marfan centers, initially in the US and later in Germany, and how and why such centers evolved over time. Then, we elucidate the three main structural elements; a team of coordinators, core disciplines, and auxiliary disciplines of health care. Moreover, we explain how a multidisciplinary health care team integrates into many other health care structures of a university medical center, including external quality assurance; quality management system; clinical risk management; center for rare diseases; aorta center; health care teams for pregnancy, for neonates, and for rehabilitation; and in structures for patient centeredness. We provide accounts of medical goals and standards for each core discipline, including pediatricians, pediatric cardiologists, cardiologists, human geneticists, heart surgeons, vascular surgeons, vascular interventionists, orthopedic surgeons, ophthalmologists, and nurses; and of auxiliary disciplines including forensic pathologists, radiologists, rhythmologists, pulmonologists, sleep specialists, orthodontists, dentists, neurologists, obstetric surgeons, psychiatrist/psychologist, and rehabilitation specialists. We conclude that a multidisciplinary health care team is a means to maximize therapeutic success.

AB Obesity is a worldwide epidemic. It is associated with increased comorbidities and increased maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. The risk of cesarean delivery is also increased in obese parturients. Anesthetic management of the obese parturient is challenging and requires adequate planning. Therefore, those patients should be referred to antenatal anesthetic consultation. Anesthesia-related complications and maternal mortality are increased in this patient population. The risk of difficult intubation is increased in obese patients. Neuraxial techniques are the preferred anesthetic techniques for cesarean delivery in obese parturients but can be technically challenging. An existing labor epidural catheter can be topped up for cesarean delivery. In patients who do not have a well-functioning labor epidural, a combined spinal epidural technique might be preferred over a single-shot spinal technique since it is technically easier in obese parturients and allows for extending the duration of the block as required. A continuous spinal technique can also be considered. Studies suggest that there is no need to reduce the dose of spinal bupivacaine in the obese parturient, but there is little data about spinal dosing in super obese parturients. Intraoperatively, patients should be placed in a ramped position, with close monitoring of ventilation and hemodynamic status. Adequate postoperative analgesia is crucial to allow for early mobilization. This can be achieved using a multimodal regimen incorporating neuraxial morphine (with appropriate observations) with scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. Thromboprophylaxis is also important in this patient population due to the increased risk of thromboembolic complications. These patients should be monitored carefully in the postoperative period, since there is increased risk of postoperative complications in the morbidly obese parturients.

ID GESTATIONAL HYPERTENSION; SLEEP; PREECLAMPSIA
AB Background. Mild obstructive sleep apnea is common in pregnancy andmay have an exacerbating role in gestational hypertension, although currently the interaction between these two diseases is uncertain. Methods. We analyzed 43 pregnant subjects, 28 with gestational hypertension (GH) and 15 with normal healthy pregnancy, by level I polysomnography. Additionally, diastolic and systolic blood pressure changes in response to obstructive respiratory events were measured by noninvasive beat-by-beat monitoring. We also assessed a subgroup (n = 27) of women with respiratory disturbance indexes < 5, for blood pressure responses to very subtle obstructive respiratory disturbances (" airflow reductions"). Results. The mean +/- standard deviation respiratory disturbance index of our 28 GH women and 15 healthy pregnant women was 10.1 +/- 9.9mmHg and 3.0 +/- 3.8mmHg, respectively. Systolic and diastolic pressure responses to these events were 30.1 +/- 12.8mmHg and 16.0 +/- 6.1mmHg for GH women and 29.1 +/- 14.2mmHg and 14.3 +/- 7.7mmHg for healthy women. For the 27 women in whom we assessed for airflow reduction events, the hemodynamic responses were 27.1 +/- 12.3mmHg systolic and 14.4 +/- 6.7mmHg diastolic. Interpretation. Upper airway obstructive events of any severity are associated with a substantial transient blood pressure response in both healthy pregnant and GH women. Whether or not these events have a clinically significant impact on women with GH remains uncertain.

AB Background. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the commonest cause of female infertility. Visceral obesity and insulin resistance are key pathophysiological mechanisms behind PCOS. Women suffering from this syndrome and infertility often seek bariatric surgery hoping that they would be able to conceive postoperatively. Objective. At present, there is no consensus on the role of bariatric surgery in the management of PCOS-associated infertility within the medical community, making it difficult to give specific advice to these women, so a review of the literature was necessary. Results. A detailed review of the literature was performed. Only 6 manuscriptswere relevant and contained quantitative data. They demonstrated that bariatric surgery results in postoperative conception rates varying from 33% to 100%. Surgery is also associated with amelioration of menstrual irregularities, hormonal abnormalities, and hirsutism that are associated with PCOS. These studies were retrospective and only had a small number of participants with infertility. Conclusions. Bariatric surgery has been shown to conclusively improve life expectancy, quality of life, and comorbidities like type 2 diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea. However, further research is required to identify whether weight loss surgery results in significant improvement in fertility of women with PCOS and to investigate which operation has the best results.

AB This cohort study was conducted in Khon Kaen, Thailand, to test the hypothesis that a longer breastfeeding duration increases the risk for dental caries in primary teeth. We collected information on infant feeding practices and potential confounders using a structured questionnaire to interview mothers or caregivers during the second trimester of pregnancy and after birth at 21 days and at 3, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. Regardless of other liquids and foods, full breastfeeding was defined as feeding breast milk but not formula, while any breastfeeding was feeding breast milk with or without formula. Two calibrated dentists measured dental caries when the children were 3-4 years of age using the decayed, missing, and filled surfaces (dmfs) index following the World Health Organization criteria. Negative binomial regression with a generalized linear model was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using dmfs as an outcome. Log-binomial regression was performed to model the caries prevalence. Of 556 children, 88.1% had dental caries with a mean dmfs of 14.2. Full breastfeeding for 6-11 months was significantly associated with a lower dmfs (adjusted RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63, 0.93) and a lower caries prevalence (adjusted RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22, 0.90). The frequency of sleeping while breast- or bottle-feeding increased the caries risk in a dose-response manner. There was no association between duration of any breastfeeding and dental caries. In conclusion, full breastfeeding for 6-11 months may protect against dental caries in primary teeth. Prolonged breastfeeding was not associated with dental caries in this population. (C) 2016 S.

AB The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a rigorously validated questionnaire with extensive use in sleep assessment. Findings from numerous factor analytic studies of the PSQI have been interpreted to support a heterogeneous factor structure model for the test. Nevertheless, the literature continues to lack a focused evaluation of whether this heterogeneous factor structure is justified. A consideration of this issue led to a conclusion that a closer analysis of the PSQI's factor structure was merited. To address this need a comparative confirmatory factor analysis for assessing the performance of the accepted factors models of the PSQI was conducted. A sample of university students (n=418), age=20.92 +/- 1.81years, BMI=23.30 +/- 2.57kg/m(2) completed the multi-structured sleep survey at Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India. Seventeen putative factor structures (three 1-Factor, eight 2-Factor, and six 3-Factor) of the PSQI from the existing literature were selected for analysis. Fourteen models (82.35%) had almost similar values for model fit indices. Two models were misfits, and one model was a poor fit. The two misfit models incorporated gender and age as covariates. The third poor fit model was used to produce a unique path diagram, which made it distinct from the remaining 16 models. The overlapping values in the fit range of the model fit indices did not support the often projected heterogeneous factor structures of the PSQI for the vast majority of the models.

AB OBJECTIVES: Considering that changes in the maternal environment may result in changes in progeny, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of sleep restriction during the last week of pregnancy on renal function and autonomic responses in male descendants at an adult age.
   METHODS: After confirmation of pregnancy, female Wistar rats were randomly assigned to either a control or a sleep restriction group. The sleep-restricted rats were subjected to sleep restriction using the multiple platforms method for over 20 hours per day between the 14 th and 20 th day of pregnancy. After delivery, the litters were limited to 6 offspring that were designated as offspring from control and offspring from sleep-restricted mothers. Indirect measurements of systolic blood pressure (BPi), renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, glomerular area and number of glomeruli per field were evaluated at three months of age. Direct measurements of cardiovascular function (heart rate and mean arterial pressure), cardiac sympathetic tone, cardiac parasympathetic tone, and baroreflex sensitivity were evaluated at four months of age.
   RESULTS: The sleep-restricted offspring presented increases in BPi, glomerular filtration rate and glomerular area compared with the control offspring. The sleep-restricted offspring also showed higher basal heart rate, increased mean arterial pressure, increased sympathetic cardiac tone, decreased parasympathetic cardiac tone and reduced baroreflex sensitivity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that reductions in sleep during the last week of pregnancy lead to alterations in cardiovascular autonomic regulation and renal morpho-functional changes in offspring, triggering increases in blood pressure.

AB The effects of gonadal steroids on neurological well-being and disease constitute a rich and rapidly expanding area of basic and clinical neuroscience. Gonadal hormones exert potent effects on monoaminergic, cholinergic and peptidergic pathways as well as neurosteroidogenesis which, in turn, impact normal brain organization and function. A spectrum of human neurological conditions are influenced by hormonal fluctuations associated with the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the menopause and use of oral contraceptives. An appreciation of these relationships may facilitate the development of specific hormonal and anti-hormonal therapies for neurological disorders as disparate as catamenial epilepsy and acute intermittent porphyria.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the association between sleep and depression using both self-reported (subjective) and actigraphic (objective) sleep traits.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 175 female primary caregivers of children with disabilities receiving care at a rehabilitation center in Punta Arenas, Chile. The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire was used to ascertain participants' depression status. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to define subjective, or perceived, sleep quality. Wrist-worn actigraph monitors, worn for seven consecutive nights, were used to characterize objective sleep quality and disturbances. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect information on sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Linear regression models were fit using continuous sleep parameters as the dependent variables and depression status as the independent variable. Multivariable models were adjusted for body mass index, marital status, smoking status, education level, and children's disabilities.
   Results: Using an eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire score >= 10, 26.3% of participants presented with depression. Depressed women were more likely to self-report overall poorer (subjective) sleep compared to non-depressed women; however, differences in sleep were not consistently noted using actigraphic (objective) sleep traits. Among the depressed, both sleep duration and total time in bed were significantly underestimated. In multivariable models, depression was negatively associated with sleep duration using both subjective (beta=-0.71, standard error [SE] = 0.25; P=0.006) and objective sleep (beta=-0.42, SE = 0.19; P=0.026).
   Conclusion: The association between sleep and depression differed comparing subjective and objective methods of assessment. Research strategies allowing for the integration of both perceived and objective measures of sleep traits are encouraged.

AB Newer generation antidepressant drugs (ADs) are widely used as the first line of treatment for major depressive disorders and are considered to be safer than tricyclic agents. In this critical review, we evaluated the literature on adverse events, tolerability and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, mirtazapine, trazodone, agomelatine, vilazodone, levomilnacipran and vortioxetine. Several side effects are transient and may disappear after a few weeks following treatment initiation, but potentially serious adverse events may persist or ensue later. They encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, gastric bleeding, dyspepsia), hepatotoxicity, weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular disturbances (heart rate, QT interval prolongation, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension), genitourinary symptoms (urinary retention, incontinence), sexual dysfunction, hyponatremia, osteoporosis and risk of fractures, bleeding, central nervous system disturbances (lowering of seizure threshold, extrapyramidal side effects, cognitive disturbances), sweating, sleep disturbances, affective disturbances (apathy, switches, paradoxical effects), ophthalmic manifestations (glaucoma, cataract) and hyperprolactinemia. At times, such adverse events may persist after drug discontinuation, yielding iatrogenic comorbidity. Other areas of concern involve suicidality, safety in overdose, discontinuation syndromes, risks during pregnancy and breast feeding, as well as risk of malignancies. Thus, the rational selection of ADs should consider the potential benefits and risks, likelihood of responsiveness to the treatment option and vulnerability to adverse events. The findings of this review should alert the physician to carefully review the appropriateness of AD prescription on an individual basis and to consider alternative treatments if available.

AB Low-income African American mothers are at particular risk for poor postpartum sleep. This study sought to understand facilitators and barriers that exist to getting a good night's sleep among these high-risk mothers. Semistructured interviews with 18 low-income African Americans (3-6 months postpartum) were conducted. Most mothers described their own sleep quality to be poor, despite the fact that their babies' sleep improved substantially from the newborn period. Mothers kept themselves awake due to their own internal worry and anxiety, along with external factors that were largely independent of babies' sleep, including work and school commitments and the home environment. For the few mothers with good sleep quality, time management and family support were strong facilitators. Findings lay the groundwork for sleep improvement interventions.

AB Women with a diagnosis of bipolar and major depressive disorders are at higher risk to develop postpartum depression. The primary objective of this longitudinal study was to determine whether daily activity rhythms and sleep parameters differ between women with and without a history of a mood disorder across the perinatal period. A secondary objective was to determine whether changes in these parameters were associated with postpartum mood. In total, 33 women were included in this study, 15 of which had a history of a mood disorder (high-risk group) and 18 who did not (low-risk group). Sleep and daily rhythms were assessed subjectively and objectively during the third trimester (26 weeks gestation) and again at 6-12 weeks postpartum. Mood was also assessed at both time points. Women in the high-risk group showed greater subjective daily rhythms and sleep disturbances across the perinatal period. Objective sleep efficiency was worse in the high-risk group in the postpartum period. Changes in both subjective daily rhythms and objective sleep efficiency were predictive of changes in depressive symptoms across the perinatal period. These findings encourage the development of preventative therapeutics to ensure circadian rhythm and sleep stability throughout the perinatal period.

AB Introduction: This article examines regulatory behaviors and physiological stress reactivity among 6-15 month-old infants with moderate to heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), a group at very high risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and self-regulation impairments, compared to low risk infants with no/low exposure. Participants: Eighteen infants and their biological mothers; nine infants [M= 10.7 (3.1) months] had moderate to heavy PAE and nine [M= 10.7 (2.9) months] had no/low exposure. Methods: Infant biobehavioral responses to the Still Face Paradigm (SFP), a standardized infant social stressor, were examined. Infant behaviors were compared across: 1) play; 2) still-face (stressor); and 3) reunion conditions, using the Infant and Caregiver Engagement Phases coding system. Salivary cortisol samples were taken at baseline, 15 and 30 minutes post SFP. Mothers completed the Infant-Toddler Symptom Questionnaire (ITSC) and Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R). Results: Infants with PAE had significantly higher baseline salivary cortisol levels [0.26 mg/dl (.12 SD)] than controls [0.11 mg/dl (0.03 SD; p .05]. Behaviorally, infants with PAE demonstrated significantly fewer social monitoring behaviors compared to controls. There were no significant group differences on caregiver-reported regulatory behaviors (ITSC) or temperament characteristics (IBQ-R). Conclusion: Biobehavioral findings revealed greater stress vulnerability and heightened risk for regulatory problems among infants with high-risk levels of PAE. Results need confirmation with a larger sample. These exploratory findings inform future studies designed to investigate early developmental problems among children with PAE and FASD, and support an overarching goal to improve early identification and early intervention strategies for a group of high-risk infants.

AB Cellular oscillators in the uterus play critical roles in the gestation processes of mammals through entraining of the clock proteins to numerous downstream genes, including growth/differentiation factor (Gdf) 10 and Gdf15. The expression of Gdf10 and Gdf15 is significantly increased in the uterus during decidualization, but the mechanism underlying the regulation of Gdf gene expression in the uterus is poorly understood. Here, we focused on the function of the cellular oscillators in the expression of Gdf family by using uterine endometrial stromal cells (UESCs) isolated from pregnant Per2-dLuc transgenic rats. A significant decline of Per2-dLuc bioluminescence activity was induced in in vitro decidualized UESCs, and concomitantly the expression of canonical clock genes was downregulated. Conversely, the expression of Gdf10 and Gdf15 of the Gdf was upregulated. In UESCs transfected with Bmal1-specific siRNA, in which Rev-erb alpha expression was downregulated, Gdf10 and Gdf15 were upregulated. However, Gdf5, Gdf7, and Gdf11 were not significantly affected by Bmal1 silencing. The expression of Gdf10 and Gdf15 was enhanced after treatment with a REV-ERB alpha antagonist in the presence or absence of progesterone. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR analysis revealed the inhibitory effect of REV-ERB alpha on the expression of Gdf10 and Gdf15 in UESCs by recognizing their gene promoters. Collectively, our findings indicate that the attenuation of REV-ERB alpha leads to an upregulation of Gdf10 and Gdf15 in decidual cells, in which cellular oscillators are impaired. Our results provide novel evidence regarding the functions of cellular oscillators regulating the expression of downstream genes during the differentiation of UESCs.

AB Objectives: The purpose of the study was to identify factors increasing or decreasing the risk for postpartum blues.
   Material and methods: A total of 101 women in their first week postpartum were included in the study. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, questions concerning their medical and social status, and psychological tests (the Neo-Five Factor Personality Inventory NEO-FFI, the Mieczyslaw Plopa and Jan Rostowski Marriage Questionnaire, and the Berlin Social Support Scales) were used.
   Results: The probability of postpartum blues was detected in 16.8% of the respondents. The risk decreased with higher satisfaction with intimacy (OR = 0.81), partner similarity (OR = 0.78), and the overall satisfaction with the relationship (OR = 0.94), while higher disappointment elevated that risk (OR = 1.12). As far as social support is concerned, further independent factors included perceived available social support (OR = 0.31), perceived instrumental social support (OR = 0.24), need for support (OR = 2.74), and protective buffering support (OR = 3.41). High level of neuroticism as well as fear of childbirth increased the risk for postpartum blues (OR = 2.17 and OR = 1.30, respectively). High level of extraversion and better quality of sleep constituted protective factors (OR = 0.74 and OR = 0.60, respectively).
   Conclusions: Maternal disappointment with marriage/relationship, neuroticism and introversion, poor quality of sleep, fear of childbirth, and seeking social support are among the factors signaling the need for careful observation for signs of possible postpartum mood disorders both, during hospitalization and the follow-up visits.

AB The use of recombinant proteins has increased in diverse commercial sectors. Various systems for protein production have been used for the optimization of production and functional protein expression. The mammary gland is considered to be a very interesting system for the production of recombinant proteins due to its high level of expression and its ability to perform post-translational modifications. Cows produce large quantities of milk over a long period of lactation, and therefore this species is an important candidate for recombinant protein expression in milk. However, transgenic cows are more difficult to generate due to the inefficiency of transgenic methodologies, the long periods for transgene detection, recombinant protein expression and the fact that only a single calf is obtained at the end of each pregnancy. An increase in efficiency for transgenic methodologies for cattle is a big challenge to overcome. Promising methodologies have been proposed that can help to overcome this obstacle, enabling the use of transgenic cattle as bioreactors for protein production in milk for industry.

AB This study attempts to develop an experimental gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) animal model in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were fed with high fat sucrose diet, impregnated, and induced with Streptozotocin and Nicotinamide on gestational day 0 (D0). Sleeping patterns of the rats were also manipulated to induce stress, a lifestyle factor that contributes to GDM. Rats were tested for glycemic parameters (glucose, C-peptide, and insulin), lipid profiles (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, and LDL), genes affecting insulin signaling (IRS-2, AKT-1, and PCK-1), glucose transporters (GLUT-2 and GLUT-4), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha), and antioxidants (SOD, CAT, and GPX) on D6 and D21. GDM rats showed possible insulin resistance as evidenced by high expression of proinflammatory cytokines, PCK-1 and CRP. Furthermore, low levels of IRS-2 and AKT-1 genes and downregulation of GLUT-4 from the initial to final phases indicate possible defect of insulin signaling. GDM rats also showed an impairment of antioxidant status and a hyperlipidemic state. Additionally, GDM rats exhibited significantly higher body weight and blood glucose and lower plasma insulin level and C-peptide than control. Based on the findings outlined, the current GDM animal model closely replicates the disease state in human and can serve as a reference for future investigations.

AB Study Objectives: To examine the association between sleep apnea and pregnancy outcomes in a large population-based cohort.
   Methods: Population-based cohort study using linked birth and hospital records was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. Participants were all women who gave birth from 2002 to 2012 (n = 636,227). Sleep apnea in the year before pregnancy or during pregnancy was identified from hospital records. Outcomes of interest were gestational diabetes, pregnancy hypertension, planned delivery, caesarean section, preterm birth, perinatal death, 5-minute Apgar score, admission to neonatal intensive care or special care nursery, and infant size for gestational age. Maternal outcomes were identified using a combination of hospital and birth records. Infant outcomes came from the birth record. Modified Poisson regression models were used to examine associations between sleep apnea and each outcome taking into account maternal age, country of birth, socioeconomic disadvantage, smoking, obesity, parity, pre-existing diabetes and hypertension.
   Results: Sleep apnea was significantly associated with pregnancy hypertension (adjusted RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.18-1.73), planned delivery (1.15; 1.07-1.23), preterm birth (1.50; 1.21-1.84), 5-minute Apgar < 7 (1.60; 1.07-2.38), admission to neonatal intensive care/special care nursery (1.26; 1.11-1.44), large-for-gestational-age infants (1.27; 1.04-1.55) but not with gestational diabetes (1.09; 0.82-1.46), caesarean section (1.06; 0.96-1.17), perinatal death (1.73; 0.92-3.25), or small-for-gestational-age infants (0.81; 0.61-1.08).
   Conclusions: Sleep apnea is associated with higher rates of obstetric complications and intervention, as well as preterm delivery. Future research should examine if these are independent of obstetric history.

AB The combination of genetic background together with food excess and lack of exercise has become the cornerstone of metabolic disorders associated to lifestyle. The scenario is furthermore reinforced by their interaction with other environmental factors (stress, sleeping patterns, education, culture, rural versus urban locations, and xenobiotics, among others) inducing epigenetic changes in the exposed individuals. The immediate consequence is the development of further alterations like obesity and metabolic syndrome, and other adverse health conditions (type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, reproductive, immune and neurological disorders). Thus, having in mind the impact of the metabolic syndrome on the worldwide public health, the present review affords the relative roles and the interrelationships of nature (genetic predisposition to metabolic syndrome) and nurture (lifestyle and environmental effects causing epigenetic changes), on the establishment of the metabolic disorders in women; disorders that may evolve to metabolic syndrome prior or during pregnancy and may be transmitted to their descendants.

AB Depression is common in pregnancy and associated with increased risk of adverse effects for the neonate. Treatment and prevention options include antidepressant therapy. The aim of this paper was to review the literature on safety of mirtazapine during pregnancy and lactation. In 31 papers a total of 390 cases of neonates exposed to mirtazapine during pregnancy or lactation have been described. There might be an association between mirtazapine and spontaneous abortion, however, this might be attributable to underlying psychiatric disease.
   An increased risk of major neonatal malformations associated with mirtazapine in pregnancy has not been reported. Although one study showed a nearly significant increase in occurrence of respiratory problems and hypoglycaemia, no indication of causality could be given. No other significant adverse effects on neonates were reported. Limited available data, four papers on 11 exposed neonates, suggest that use of mirtazapine during breastfeeding is safe due to a low relative infant dose. High plasma levels might be associated with increased body weight and sleep. However, the reported data are too scarce to come to a clear assessment of the risk of mirtazapine in lactation.
   No information is available on the use of mirtazapine in pregnancy and Poor Neonatal Adaptation Syndrome (PNAS) or neurobehavioral development at an age over one year.
   In conclusion, mirtazapine seems to be safe in pregnancy, especially regarding incidence of congenital malformations. There are not enough data available to come to a conclusion on the safety of mirtazapine during lactation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Few data are available about obesity surgery in adolescent patients. Objective: To assess long-term outcomes after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in patients <18 years. Setting: University Hospital, Europe. Methods: A retrospective study of prospectively collected data of patients <18 years (childhood group; ChG) (n = 28) treated by LRYGB of which 19 were available for follow-up between 2.4 and 10.2 years (mean 7.2 years). This group of patients was matched with an adult control group (AdG) of randomly chosen patients with similar characteristics who underwent LRYGB during the same period. The extensive survey included a telephonic questionnaire. Results: 19 (12 females) of the 28 patients (67.9%) were available for follow-up. Preoperatively, 3 had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 1 arterial hypertension, S dyslipidemia and 1 sleep apnea. In the ChG, average BMI after 7 years dropped from 38.9 kg/m(2) preoperatively to 27.5 kg/m(2). In the AdG, average BMI decreased from 39.4 to 27.1 kg/m(2) in the same time period (nonsignificant between groups). One patient in the ChG needed a reoperation (internal hernia) versus 3 patients in the AdG (1 leak, 2 obstructions). All patients resolved their initial comorbidities. Two of 12 female patients in the ChG became pregnant 6 and 8 years after surgery, respectively, despite seemingly adequate oral contraception. Compliance with postoperative guidelines was good in 16/19 patients in ChG and in 14/18 patients in the AdG. Overall degree of satisfaction was high: 8.2/10 (SD 1.2, range 6-10) in the ChG and 8.9/10 (SD 1.7, range 5-10) in the AdG. Conclusion: LRYGB seems to be safe, provide good weight loss, and cure comorbidities in an adolescent population. Satisfaction degree is high. Inadvertent pregnancy despite conventional contraception is a possible issue. (C) 2016 S Karger GmbH, Freiburg

AB Introduction: Obesity during pregnancy is associated with a wide spectrum of maternal, fetal and neonatal complications. This study compared placental pathology in women with obesity and normal weight gravidas.
   Materials and methods: This is a retrospective case-control study. The sample was randomly selected from a total of 1000 deliveries of largely Caucasian population in a single institution, recruited for the study of sleep disordered breathing, where the placenta is submitted for pathological examination for clinical indications based on national guidelines. Cases (Body mass index - BMI >= 30 kg/m(2); n = 47) and controls (BMI < 25 kg/m(2), n = 45) were selected based on BMI obtained from the first prenatal visit. Placental pathology, clinical parameters and limited outcomes were extracted from medical records. Placental weight range was defined as small for gestational age (SGA) if <10th percentile, large for gestational age (LGA) if >90th percentile.
   Results: Mean BMI was 36.2 +/- 5.5 in the group with obesity and 21.7 +/- 1.9 in the control group (p < 0.01). There was a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes in cases compared to controls (14/47 vs. 3/45, p = 0.006) while preterm birth was significantly higher in the control group (9/47 vs. 19/46, p = 0.02). There were more LGA placentas in cases versus controls (12/47 vs. 2/46, p = 0.007; even after adjusting for diabetes). More histological features of inflammation, marginal insertion of the umbilical cord and intervillous thrombi in the parenchyma were also noted in the case group.
   Conclusions: Results from the current study suggest that maternal obesity measured at early pregnancy may have effects on both placental implantation and growth, and further exacerbate the hypercoagulable state in placenta. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to explore attitudes towards family formation in single or cohabiting childless women of advanced age. The design comprised semi-structured qualitative interviews of 20 women aged 34-39 years attending the Fertility Assessment and Counselling Clinic, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. A sample of 10 single women and 10 cohabiting women was chosen with equal distribution of postgraduate education length. Data were analysed using content analysis following the method of Graneheim and Lundman and consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ). The general attitude towards family formation was characterized by a fear of the consequences of choosing motherhood on one hand, and a ticking biological clock' and a wish to establish a nuclear family on the other. The women idealized the perception of perfect mothering in terms of uncompromising expectations of child rearing and showed an increasing awareness of solo motherhood as a possible solution to advanced age, the wish of a child and single status compared to earlier studies. Our study contributes to knowledge and understanding of personal considerations related to childbearing in nullipara women in their mid- to late 30s and may be useful in a fertility assessment and counselling setting.

AB The genetic architecture of placental abruption (PA) remains poorly understood. We examined variations in SNPs of circadian clock-related genes in placenta with PA risk. We also explored placental and maternal genomic contributions to PA risk. Placental genomic DNA samples were isolated from 280 PA cases and 244 controls. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Cardio-MetaboChip. We examined 116 SNPs in 13 genes known to moderate circadian rhythms. Logistic regression models were fit to estimate odds ratios (ORs). The combined effect of multiple SNPs on PA risk was estimated using a weighted genetic risk score. We examined independent and joint associations of wGRS derived from placental and maternal genomes with PA. Seven SNPs in five genes (ARNTL2, CRY2, DEC1, PER3 and RORA), in the placental genome, were associated with PA risk. Each copy of the minor allele (G) of a SNP in the RORA gene (rs2899663) was associated with a 30% reduced odds of PA (95% CI 0.52-0.95). The odds of PA increased with increasing placental-wGRS (P-trend < 0.001). The ORs were 1.00, 2.16, 3.24 and 4.48 across quartiles. Associations persisted after the maternal-wGRS was included in the model. There was evidence of an additive contribution of placental and maternal genetic contributions to PA risk. Participants with placental-and maternal-wGRS in the highest quartile, compared with those in the lowest quartile, had a 15.57-fold (95% CI 3.34-72.60) increased odds of PA. Placental variants in circadian clock-related genes are associated with PA risk; and the association persists after control of genetic variants in the maternal genome.

AB study involved 30 non-pregnant, clinically healthy Comisana sheep in order to evaluate the effect of shearing on rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), haematocrit (Het), haemoglobin (Hb) and total proteins (TP). During the spring season the animals were divided into two groups: twenty sheep, designated as the experimental group, were shorn (Group A), and ten sheep, designed as the control group, were left unshorn (Group B). All animals were weighed using a mechanical balance in the morning before shearing and after shearing. During the experimental period ambient temperature and relative humidity were recorded, while the temperature-humidity index was calculated. The measurements of studied secondary stress parameters were assessed before shearing (day 0), 1, 15, 30, 45 and 60 days after shearing in the experimental group and at the same time points in the control group. Two-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni's multiple post hoc comparison test, showed a significant effect of shearing and time on RT, RR, HR, RBC, Het and Hb. These parameters play an important role in providing complementary information for the assessment of thermal stress, since they are affected in response to the stress of shearing, suggesting that they are useful secondary stress indices in shorn sheep. These modifications are useful to monitor the stressful conditions, but also to evaluate health and welfare of animals, and to improve their productivity.

AB Study Objectives: To evaluate the construct validity and factor structure of the Spanish-language version of the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test questionnaire (FIRST-S) when used in early pregnancy.
   Methods: A cohort of 647 women were interviewed at <= 16 weeks of gestation to collect information regarding lifestyle, demographic, and sleep characteristics. The factorial structure of the FIRST-S was tested through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA). Internal consistency and construct validity were also assessed by evaluating the association between the FIRST-S with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Item response theory (IRT) analyses were conducted to complement classical test theory (CTT) analytic approaches.
   Results: The mean score of the FIRST-S was 13.8 (range: 9-33). The results of the EFA showed that the FIRST-S contained a one-factor solution that accounted for 69.8% of the variance. The FIRST-S items showed good internal consistency (Cronbach a = 0.81). CFA results corroborated the one-factor structure finding from the EFA; and yielded measures indicating goodness of fit (comparative fit index of 0.902) and accuracy (root mean square error of approximation of 0.057). The FIRST-S had good construct validity as demonstrated by statistically significant associations of FIRST-S scores with sleep quality, antepartum depression and anxiety symptoms. Finally, results from IRT analyses suggested excellent item infit and outfit measures.
   Conclusions: The FIRST-S was found to have good construct validity and internal consistency for assessing vulnerability to insomnia during early pregnancy.

AB Introduction: Moderate exercise training during the pregnancy benefits both the pregnant woman and the fetus. The research papers consulted have linked physical activity with the reduction of the number of cesareans, instrumental delivery and with a more physiological delivery. It also prevents excessive weight gain in women and decreases the risk of gestational diabetes and high blood pressure.
   Aims: The aim of this research is to know if an exercise program of moderate character with Water Study Exercise Pregnant (SWEP) method, performed in an aquatic environment, contributes to have more favorable results in the perinatal period, both for women and baby.
   Material and methods: The design is a randomized clinical trial. The sample will consist of 364 pregnant women, with a total universe of 6,579 births occurred in Granada (Spain) during 2014. The sample was divided into two groups, intervention group and control group. The activity will be carried out in the water sporting facilities of the Faculty of Sports Science of the University of Granada, which have two pools suitable for our purposes: a 25-meter polyvalent pool and a 12.5-meter pool for training.
   Results: The exercise program designed specifically for the project called SWEP is performed from 20 to 37 weeks of gestation (SG), and it consists of three weekly sessions, with duration of 60 minutes each. Sessions will include three phases: warm-up phase, the main phase in which the exercise is divided into an aerobic phase and strength training and endurance training phase and a final phase of stretching and relaxation. The variables that will be studied are: a) Maternal: weight, BMI, blood pressure, O'Sullivan test, postpartum depression, level of self-rated health, sleep quality and perceived exertion during physical activity; b) fetal: weight, Apgar scores, head circumference and GA (Gestational age); c) peripartum: time dilation, expulsion and delivery, type of delivery, episiotomy, type of feed received by the RN and time of exclusive breasffeeding; and d) descriptive: age, occupation, education level, type of exercise done before and OF (obstetric formula).
   Conclusion: With aquatic moderate physical activity during pregnancy (method SWEP), we intended to improve the variables above.

AB Background
   Generalised itching is one of the most common dermatological symptoms in pregnant women. Having itchy skin during pregnancy may be very frustrating and can lead to poor sleep, exhaustion and impaired quality of life. There is a need for a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for treating itching in pregnancy.
   Objectives
   To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for treating generalised itching (not caused by systemic diseases or skin lesions) in pregnancy.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 January 2016) and the reference list of the one identified study.
   Selection criteria
   All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions for itching in pregnancy. Quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs, RCTs using a cross-over design, and studies reported in abstract form (without full text) were not eligible for inclusion.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed the one trial report that was identified from the search strategy and this was subsequently excluded.
   Main results
   There are no included studies as we did not identify any relevant trials.
   Authors' conclusions
   Generalised itching ( not caused by systemic disease or skin lesions) is quite a common symptom in pregnancy. However, there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide practice in terms of the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for treating this condition.
   Well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of topical and systemic pharmacological interventions as well as any adverse effects of the interventions. Such studies should consider important outcomes such as relief of itching, women's satisfaction, sleep disturbance, and adverse effects.

AB Objective. We report on the distribution of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution in the first trimester and on the association between TCMconstitution and maternal symptoms related to pregnancy. Methods. Participants were followed up until delivery to observe primary measures (gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus) and secondarymeasures (signs of miscarriage, miscarriage, nausea and vomiting, and sleepiness and defecation during pregnancy). Descriptive analysis, t-tests, chisquare tests, and logistic regression analysis were used in this study. Results. 61.8% of the participants had unbalanced constitutions. We did not find a significant association between the TCM constitution and gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, miscarriage, signs of miscarriage, and defecation during pregnancy. And we found that women with unbalanced constitutions in early pregnancy had a greater likelihood of severe nausea and vomiting and poor sleep during pregnancy in the logistic regression analysis. Conclusions. These results have implications for female health care providers and policy makers. Identification of TCM constitution may be helpful for understanding nausea and vomiting and poor sleepiness during pregnancy, especially in the condition that can not be explained by modern medical science, and be helpful for making program to improve these uncomfortable symptoms.

AB Background: Disturbed sleep is a significant health issue for pregnant women. Inadequate vitamin D intake is common among pregnant women and can affect many bodily systems. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to test the hypothesis that serum vitamin D levels are low in pregnant women who have poor sleep quality in their last trimester.
   Methods: We enrolled 92 pregnant women who were admitted to the Maternity Clinic of Turgut Ozal University (Ankara, Turkey) in their last trimester. Venous blood sampling was performed to determine serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Sleep quality was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire. The Student t test and Chi-square test were used to evaluate the relationships between variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of the vitamin D level.
   Results: The median score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire was 6.2 +/- 3.3 (range, 1-17). We determined that 43.5% (40) of participants had poor sleep quality. The mean number of sleep hours at night was 8.6 +/- 1 hours (range, 6.30-11 hours), and the mean sleep latency was 20.3 +/- 12.7 minutes (range, 5-60 minutes). Vitamin D levels were measured for 87 participants; the median serum level of 25 (OH) vitamin D was 22.9 +/- 16.2 ng/mL (range, 4.9-99 ng/mL). Among all patients, we did not determine any significance between the vitamin D-deficient group and the non vitamin D-deficient group with regard to the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire Inventory (PSQI) total score and subcomponents scores of the questionnaire (p > 0.05). Among 37 patients with poor sleep quality and for whom the vitamin D level was measured, 56.8% (21) women had vitamin D deficiency, and 81% (30) women had vitamin D insufficiency. However, we did not find any significance between participants with poor sleep and participants with good sleep quality with regard to age, occupational status, relationship with her partner, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), weight gain during pregnancy, being primiparus, length of labor, and mode of delivery. Our findings further showed that being in a low income family was associated with poor sleep quality.
   Conclusion: Inadequate vitamin D and poor sleep quality are prevalent in pregnant women, but low levels of vitamin D are not associated with poor sleep quality. Further studies with larger sample sizes and studies that include preterm deliveries and special sleep disorders should be performed to understand this issue better.

AB Introduction and objective. Spontaneous abortion constitutes one of the most frequent complication of human pregnancy. Despite intensive research efforts undertaken to date, the etiopathogenesis of early pregnancy loss has not been fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to analyze the role of selected non-somatic risk factors for early pregnancy loss in patients with various clinical manifestations of spontaneous abortion.
   Materials and methods. The study included 242 women hospitalized between 2001 and 2004 in the 3rd Chair and Department of Gynecology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland (Teaching Hospital No. 4) with various clinical categories of spontaneous abortion. Each patient completed a questionnaire assessing her exposure to the examined factors. In patients with threatened abortion dismissed from the hospital with viable gestation, the course of pregnancy was followed-up using questionnaire data and medical records.
   Results. In the studied population of women with abnormal early pregnancy course, a significant impact on the risk of miscarriage was observed in case of such factors as: exposure to stress at home and limited number of hours of nightly sleep. Factors such as occupational hazards, diet, stress, heavy housework and use of cigarettes or alcohol did not exert a significant effect on the risk of miscarriage in the studied population.
   Conclusions. The results of this study confirm the complexity of the early pregnancy loss etiopatogenesis. Further research need to be conducted in order to identify the non-somatic causative agents of various clinical forms of miscarriage. It may help do select women in reproductive age at high risk of early pregnancy loss and show the ways in which effective preventive measures can be introduced in such population.

AB The purpose of the present study was to investigate dream anxiety, impulsivity, and chronotypes in patients with dipper/non-dipper hypertension and to compare with healthy controls. Sixty-two patients diagnosed with hypertension and 33 healthy individuals were recruited in this study. A history of current psychiatric illness or psychotropic drug usage, significant cardiac, medical or neurological disease and pregnancy were the exclusion criterias for the study. All patients and healthy controls underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The Van Dream Anxiety Scale, Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Barratt Impulsivity Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were administered to all participants. There were two groups; patients with hypertension (dipper, n = 26 and non-dipper, n = 36) and healthy controls (n = 33). No differences between groups among gender (chi(2) = 4.42 and p = 0.110) and mean age (F = 0.239 and p = 0.795) were found. In patients with hypertension; dream anxiety, impulsivity, depression and trait anxiety scores were significantly higher than healthy controls. Sleep quality was poorer in patients with hypertension and there was no difference according to chronotype between patients and controls. There were no differences between dipper and non-dipper groups according to dream anxiety, sleep quality, impulsivity, state-trait anxiety, and depressive scores. In conclusion, dream anxiety is a previously unaddressed psychological entity that, in addition to anxiety, depression, impulsivity and poorer sleep quality, appears in hypertensive patients. Longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes would be valuable to elucidate the relationship between dream anxiety and hypertension patterns.

AB Objective: To perform a detailed epidemiological study of Chinese women and the relationship between restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy and any associated complications during delivery.
   Methods: A total of 3874 pregnant women (18-40 years) who had delivered babies at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from May 2011 to May 2014 were enrolled in the study. Using a face-to-face interview questionnaire, data were collected pertaining to RLS incidence in pregnancy and any associated complications during delivery. The relationship between RLS frequency and pregnancy or delivery complications was further investigated.
   Results: Among 12.3% of the eligible participants, RLS prevalence occurred at least weekly. Older pregnant women were more likely to suffer from RLS. Individuals who experienced RLS at least weekly reported a statistically higher frequency of excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and preeclampsia compared with those without RLS.
   Conclusion: The study revealed that RLS was frequent in Chinese pregnant women, especially in those with pregnancy or delivery complications such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and preeclampsia. Restless legs syndrome was also associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recurrent stress during neonatal intensive care taxes the adaptive capacity of the premature infant and may be a risk factor for suboptimal developmental outcomes. This research used a descriptive, cross-sectional design and a life course perspective to examine the relationship between resting adrenocorticoid values at 37 postmenstrual weeks of age and cumulative pain-associated stressor exposure in prematurely born infants. Subjects were 59 infants born at under 35 completed weeks of gestation, who were at least 2 weeks of age, and who had been cared for in the NICU since birth. No significant relationships were identified between cortisol values and any of the study variables (number of skin breaking procedures, hours of assisted ventilation, gestational age at birth, exposure to antenatal steroids, history of severe academia, birthweight, days of age to attain birthweight, weight at testing, days of age at testing, recent pain-associated procedures, and 17-OHP value). A significant negative correlation (Spearman rank, one-tailed) between the number of skin-breaking procedures and 17-OHP values was identified (r = -.232, p = .039). Recurrent pain-associated stressor exposure may be a more important factor in explaining the variance of 17-OHP values at 37 postmenstrual weeks of age than birthweight, gestational age, or chronological age.

AB Background: It has been suggested that sleep disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy may adversely influence maternal as well as fetal well being.
   Objectives: To examine the effect of maternal SDB on neonatal neurological examination and perinatal complications.
   Methods: Pregnant women of singleton uncomplicated pregnancies were prospectively recruited from a community and hospital low risk obstetric surveillance. All participants completed a sleep questionnaire in the second trimester and underwent ambulatory sleep evaluation (WatchPAT (TM), Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). They were categorized as SDB (apnea hypopnea index > 5) and non-SDB. Maternal and newborn records were reviewed and a neonatal neurologic examination was conducted during the first 48 hours.
   Results: The study group included 44 women and full-term infants; 11 of the women (25%) had SDB. Mean maternal age of the SDB and non-SDB groups was 32.3 +/- 2.8 and 32.5 +/- 4.7 years, respectively (P = 0.86). Mean body mass index before the pregnancy in the SDB and non-SDB groups was 25.8 +/- 4.7 and 22.0 +/- 2.5 kg/m(2), respectively (P = 0.028). No differences were found between infants born to mothers with SDB and non-SDB in birth weight (3353.8 +/- 284.8 vs. 3379.1 +/- 492.4 g), gestational age (39.5 +/- 0.9 vs. 39.2 +/- 1.5 weeks), 5 minute Apgar scores (9.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 9.9 +/- 0.3), and neurologic examination scores (95.2 +/- 3.9 vs. 94.6 +/- 4.1). P value for all was not significant.
   Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that maternal mild SDB during pregnancy has no adverse effect on neonatal neurologic examination or on perinatal complications.

   HYPERTENSION; COMORBIDITIES; MANAGEMENT; HYPOXIA
AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with nocturnal intermittent hypoxia, which may be responsible for increased circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inflammatory mediators, such as metalloproteinases (MMPs), and which contributes to the pathogenesis of systemic hypertension. Why some OSA patients remain normotensive is poorly understood. Relaxin-2, a pregnancy hormone, may sometimes circulate in men and could increase in hypoxic conditions. It exerts a vasodilatory activity and can modulate the release of molecules, such as MMPs and VEGF. Objectives: The objective of this study was to explore if circulating relaxin-2 in male OSA subjects may be related to OSA severity, to circulating levels of MMPs, of their inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases; TIMPs), and of VEGF, and if it may protect from hypertension. Patients and Methods: Fifty untreated male subjects with suspected OSA were recruited. After nocturnal polysomnography, a morning venous blood sample was withdrawn. Then, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was performed. Results: The respiratory disturbance index in the sample was 30.4 [interquartile range (IQR) 15.6-55.2]. Relaxin-2 was detectable in 20 subjects. These subjects did not differ in OSA severity or diurnal and nocturnal BP from subjects with undetectable relaxin-2, but they showed lower TIMP-1 (126.8 +/- 29.1 vs. 156.9 +/- 41.7 pg/ml, respectively; p = 0.007) and a marginally higher MMP-9/TIMP-1 molar ratio [0.58 (IQR 0.23-1.35) vs. 0.25 (IQR 0.15-0.56); p = 0.052]. Conclusions: Relaxin-2 in male subjects was not related to OSA severity, but it was associated with lower TIMP-1. As it was often undetectable, even when BP values were normal, it is unlikely that it plays a role as a major factor protecting from hypertension in OSA. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION

ID PREGNANCY
AB Objective: To highlight ways in which pharmacists can influence the infant mortality rate.
   Summary: The infant mortality rate in the United States is higher than in many other industrialized nations. Because pharmacists are accessible and knowledgeable health care professionals, there are multiple opportunities for pharmacist intervention from the preconception to the postpartum periods that can affect the leading causes of infant death. Specifically, areas of focus for pharmacists' direct patient care activities can include family planning, substance use, folic acid, drug information, maternal disease management, maternal medication management, infant medication management, safe sleep, breastfeeding, and vaccines. In addition, there are opportunities for pharmacists to influence infant mortality through clinical-community linkages, research, and advocacy.
   Conclusions: Through clinical-community linkages and direct patient care, pharmacists can work toward reducing infant mortality in their communities. (C) 2016 American Pharmacists Association (R). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundUncontrolled studies in human have suggested that memantine might be a suitable option for migraine prophylaxis.
   ObjectiveTo assess the efficacy and tolerability of memantine for migraine prophylaxis.
   MethodsThis was a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group study. Sixty patients with migraine without aura were randomized using a computer-generated list to receive memantine (10 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the difference in change from baseline in the monthly attack frequency at week 12 between the two groups (using migraine diary). Secondary efficacy measures were assessed using several clinical, functional, and psychological instruments. We performed both complete case (CC) and intention-to-treat analyses (ITT).
   ResultsTwenty-five patients in the memantine group and 27 patients in the placebo group completed the study. Patients in the memantine group showed significantly greater reduction (mean change; 3.4; 95%CI, 2.3-4.4) in the monthly attack frequency than the placebo group (mean change, 1.0; 95%CI, 0.3-1.7) (mean difference [MD], 2.3; 95%CI, 1.1-3.5, P<.001). Both CC (MD, 4.9; 95%CI, 2.6-7.2 days), and ITT analyses (MD, 5.2; 95%CI, 2.0-8.5) showed significantly higher reduction in the mean number of migraine days in the memantine group than the placebo group (P<.01). Patients in the memantine group experienced greater reduction in the number of work absence days, severity, and disability score than the patients in the placebo group in both ITT and CC analyses. Changes in quality of life, sleep, depression, and anxiety did not differ between the two groups. Three patients in the memantine group complained of sedation, mild vertigo and nausea, and drowsiness. In the placebo group, one patient complained of nausea and another patient discontinued treatment after 2 weeks due to vertigo.
   ConclusionMemantine might be a tolerable and efficacious option for prophylaxis in patients with migraine without aura. Tolerability, short duration required for titration, and safety profile in pregnancy might give memantine an advantage over other antimigraine medications. The study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (Registration number: IRCT2013120115616N1).

   Jay Rosenblatt effectively promoted research on rabbit maternal behavior through his interaction with colleagues in Mexico. Here we review the activities of pregnant and lactating rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), their neurohormonal regulation, and the synchronization of behavior between mother and kits. Changing concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin throughout gestation regulate nest-building (digging, straw-carrying, fur-pulling) and prime the mother's brain to respond to the newborn. Nursing is the only mother-young contact throughout lactation. It happens once/day, inside the nest, with ca. 24 h periodicity, and lasts around 3 min. Periodicity and duration of nursing depend on a threshold of suckling as procedures reducing the amount of nipple stimulation interfere with the temporal aspects of nursing, though not with the doe's maternal motivation. Synchronization between mother and kits, critical for nursing, relies on: a) the production of pheromonal cues which guide the young to the mother's nipples for suckling; b) an endogenous circadian rhythm of anticipatory activity in the young, present since birth. Milk intake entrains the kits' locomotor behavior, corticosterone secretion, and the activity of several brain structures. Sibling interactions within the huddle, largely determined by body mass at birth, are important for: a) maintaining body temperature; b) ensuring normal neuromotor and social development. Suckling maintains nursing behavior past the period of abundant milk production but abrupt and efficient weaning occurs in concurrently pregnant-lactating does by unknown factors. Conclusion: female rabbits have evolved a reproductive strategy largely dissociating maternal care from maternal presence, whose multifactorial regulation warrants future investigations.

AB Major adaptations occur in the maternal cardiovascular system during pregnancy and after delivery; knowledge of these changes is essential to the health management of pregnant women. This paper presents a longitudinal study and proposes a methodology to monitor daily pulse rates (PRs) and characterize the weekly changes in maternal PRs before and after delivery. PRs were recorded during nightly sleep using an automatic monitoring system. PRs of the nonpregnant woman were taken as a reference. Weekly PR properties were characterized by histogram and a two-Gaussian mixture model. A coupling use of sample entropy and pulse rate was applied to cluster the stages during recovery period after delivery. Results depicted a profile of individual's cardiac recovery process in late pregnancy and after delivery. The results reveal that maternal PRs show different patterns in various stages of recovery. Later stages of recovery seemed to require a much longer period. The present study introduced a convenient approach in long-term maternal cardiac condition monitoring.

AB Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is categorized by the U.S. Surgeon General as a major public health problem. VTE is relatively common and associated with reduced survival and substantial health-care costs, and recurs frequently. VTE is a complex (multifactorial) disease, involving interactions between acquired or inherited predispositions to thrombosis and VTE risk factors, including increasing patient age and obesity, hospitalization for surgery or acute illness, nursing-home confinement, active cancer, trauma or fracture, immobility or leg paresis, superficial vein thrombosis, and, in women, pregnancy and puerperium, oral contraception, and hormone therapy. Although independent VTE risk factors and predictors of VTE recurrence have been identified, and effective primary and secondary prophylaxis is available, the occurrence of VTE seems to be relatively constant, or even increasing.

ID INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; PHYSICAL VIOLENCE; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE;

AB Objectives To determine the prevalence of non-violent, gender-based forms of maltreatment of women by husbands and in-laws [i.e., gender-based household maltreatment (GBHM)] during pregnancy and postpartum; to clarify the role of GBHM in compromising infant health, and whether this role extends beyond that previously observed for intimate partner violence (IPV).
   Methods Cross-sectional, quantitative data were collected from women (ages 15-35) seeking immunizations for their infants <6 months of age (N = 1061) in urban health centers in Mumbai, India. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess associations between maternal abuse (perinatal IPV, in-law violence and GBHM) and recent infant morbidity (diarrhea, respiratory distress, fever, colic and vomiting).
   Results More than one in four women (28.4 %) reported IPV during their recent pregnancy and/or during the postpartum period, 2.6 % reported perinatal violence from in-laws, and 49.0 % reported one or more forms of perinatal GBHM. In adjusted regression models that included all forms of family violence and maltreatment, perinatal GBHM remained significantly associated with infant morbidity (AORs 1.4-1.9); perinatal IPV and in-law violence ceased to predict infant morbidity in models including GBHM.
   Conclusions Findings indicate that non-violent expressions of gender inequity (e.g., nutritional deprivation, deprivation of sleep, blocking access to health care during pregnancy) are more strongly associated with poor infant health than physical or sexual violence from husbands or in-laws in urban India. These results strongly suggest the need to expand the conception of gender inequities beyond IPV to include non-violent forms of gendered mistreatment in considering their impact on infant health.

AB The significance of ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring during pregnancy has not been established. We performed a prospective study to elucidate whether ABP measures are associated with small-for-gestational-age birth weight (SGA). We studied 146 pregnant women who were seen for maternal medical checkups or suspected hypertension. ABP monitoring was performed for further assessment of hypertension. The outcome measure was SGA. The subjects were classified by their medical history and ABP as having preeclampsia or gestational hypertension (n = 68 cases), chronic hypertension (n = 48) or white-coat hypertension (n = 30). There were 50 (34.2%) cases of SGA by the fetal growth reference standard. In multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, body mass index, the presence of prior pregnancy, current smoking habit and the use of antihypertensive medications, 24-h SBP (per 10 mm Hg (odds ratio (OR): 1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-2.38; P < 0.001)) was more closely associated with SGA than clinic BP (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 0.92-2.13; P = 0.11). The results were essentially the same if 24-h BP was replaced by awake or sleep SBP. Ambulatory diastolic BP showed the same tendency. However, abnormal circadian rhythm was not associated with the outcome. In conclusion, ambulatory BP monitoring measures performed during pregnancy were more closely associated with SGA than clinic BP.

TI Preeclampsia Prediction in Type 1 Diabetes and Diurnal Blood Pressure
   Methodology
SO CURRENT HYPERTENSION REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
DE ABPM; methodology; oscillometry; preeclampsia; type 1 diabetes mellitus
AB The most recent Cochrane reviews on oral antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy conclude that no substantial benefits for the mother or fetus are demonstrated so far. Whether this applies for a high-risk and diabetic pregnancy is doubtful. The aim of this short review is an introduction to the field of ambulatory blood pressure measurements in pregnancy and in particular in women with type 1 diabetes. Diabetic pregnancy is complicated with a 50% risk of hypertension/preeclampsia. In the nonpregnant, diabetic women minute increases in blood pressure as well as in albuminuria are forerunners for incipient and overt nephropathy. Medication is essential and can conserve renal function, modifying the risk of renal insufficiency. During pregnancy, renal insufficiency in women with diabetes leads to termination of pregnancy. Therefore, detection of minute changes based on reliable measurements in this high-risk population is invaluable to protect the mother's kidney function and, if possible, prolong pregnancy for the benefit of the fetus.
   Estimates of risk by blood pressure evaluation in these women are influenced by pregnancy per se and diabetes vasculopathy. Several factors have to be considered as few monitors are validated for use in pregnancy and not many of the different methodologies have undergone thorough investigation. The use of absolute values of blood pressure have the advantage that fewer assumptions are necessary on how blood pressure behaves due to modes of evaluation and biological rhythm. Monitors should be chosen with care considering the clinical setting, timing, and population, which influences the outcome, thus, the monitors ought to be validated for the specific condition they are applied for. The strategy for the studies used for safe conclusions in this brief review was chosen with priority of the papers with the best, validated methodology on BP measurements, which is by no way guaranteed in numerous recent publications.
   Inherent characteristics of the measurements to be considered are reproducibility, consistency, precision, and trend over scale of measurement. Studies on these issues suggest that consistency and precision depend on which monitor is used. During pregnancy, the reproducibility and specificity depend on the timing and whether measurements are performed repeatedly. Over- and underestimations of blood pressure are typical for 24-h monitoring in high-as well as low risk pregnancies.
   Preeclampsia is associated with urinary albumin excretion rate, reduced night/day ratio, and elevated diurnal blood pressure from first trimester and onwards. However, due to blunting of the diurnal variation, the night/day rhythm provides no good prediction of preeclampsia. Diurnal measurement is a valuable estimate of blood pressure in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.

AB Background: The objective of this study was an investigation of the association between depression and sleep quality. Materials and Methods: his cross-sectional study was performed on 360 delivered women that referred to thirty health-care centers in Ardabil, Iran. he Standard Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire was used to the investigation of sleep quality. We used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Questionnaire to assess postpartum depression. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of sleep quality with postpartum depression. Results: Chance of depression in women with poor sleep quality was 3.34 times higher than those with good sleep quality (odds ratio = 3.34; 95% conidence interval: 2.04-5.48; P < 0.001). After controlling for some risk factors, an association observed between sleep quality and depression in postpartum women. Conclusion: we found an association between sleep quality in women who had given birth in the last 3 months and symptoms of postpartum depression.

AB Objective: overweight/obese weight status during pregnancy increases risk of a range of adverse health outcomes for mother and child. Whereas identification of those who are overweight/obese prepregnancy and in early pregnancy is straightforward, prediction of who will experience excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG), and thus be at greater risk of becoming overweight or obese during pregnancy is more challenging. The present study sought to better identify those at risk of EGWG by exploring pre-pregnancy BMI as well as a range of psychosocial risk factors identified as risk factors in prior research.
   Methods: 225 pregnant women completed self-reported via postal survey measures of height, weight, and psychosocial variables at 16-18 weeks gestation, and reported their weight again at 32-34 weeks to calculate GWG. Classification and regression tree analysis (CART) was used to find subgroups in the data with increased risk of EGWG based on their pre-pregnancy BMI and psychosocial risk factor scores at Time 1.
   Findings: CART confirmed that self-reported BMI status was a strong predictor of EGWG risk for women who were overweight/obese pre-pregnancy. Normal weight women with low motivation to maintain a healthy diet and who reported lower levels of partner support were also at considerable risk of EGWG.
   Implications for practice: present findings offer support for inclusion of psychosocial measures (in addition to BMI) in early antenatal visits to detect risk of EGWG. However, these findings also underscore the need for further consideration of effect modifiers that place women at increased or decreased risk of EGWG. Proposed additional constructs are discussed to direct further theory-driven research. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Evidence of the short term relationship between maternal and fetal heart rates has been found in previous studies. However there is still limited knowledge about underlying mechanisms and patterns of the coupling throughout gestation. In this study, Transfer Entropy (TE) was used to quantify directed interactions between maternal and fetal heart rates at various time delays and gestational ages. Experimental results using maternal and fetal electrocardiograms showed significant coupling for 63 out of 65 fetuses, by statistically validating against surrogate pairs. Analysis of TE showed a decrease in transfer of information from fetus to the mother with gestational age, alongside the maturation of the fetus. On the other hand, maternal to fetal TE was significantly greater in mid (26-31 weeks) and late (32-41 weeks) gestation compared to early (16-25 weeks) gestation (Mann Whitney Wilcoxon (MWW) p<0.05). TE further increased from mid to late, for the fetuses with RMSSD of fetal heart rate being larger than 4 msec in the late gestation. This difference was not observed for the fetuses with smaller RMSSD, which could be associated with the quiet sleep state. Delay in the information transfer from mother to fetus significantly decreased (p = 0.03) from mid to late gestation, implying a decrease in fetal response time. These changes occur concomitant with the maturation of the fetal sensory and autonomic nervous systems with advancing gestational age. The effect of maternal respiratory rate derived from maternal ECG was also investigated and no significant relationship was found between breathing rate and TE at any lag. In conclusion, the application of TE with delays revealed detailed information on the fetal-maternal heart rate coupling strength and latency throughout gestation, which could provide novel clinical markers of fetal development and well-being.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Insomnia affects 10% to 30% of the population with a total cost of $92.5 to $107.5 billion annually. Short-term, chronic, and other types of insomnia are the three major categories according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd ed. The criteria for diagnosis are difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or early awakening despite the opportunity for sleep; symptoms must be associated with impaired daytime functioning and occur at least three times per week for at least one month. Factors associated with the onset of insomnia include a personal or family history of insomnia, easy arousability, poor self-reported health, and chronic pain. Insomnia is more common in women, especially following menopause and during late pregnancy, and in older adults. A comprehensive sleep history can confirm the diagnosis. Psychiatric and medical problems, medication use, and substance abuse should be ruled out as contributing factors. Treatment of comorbid conditions alone may not resolve insomnia. Patients with movement disorders (e.g., restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder), circadian rhythm disorders, or breathing disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea) must be identified and treated appropriately. Chronic insomnia is associated with cognitive difficulties, anxiety and depression, poor work performance, decreased quality of life, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Insomnia can be treated with nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. Nonpharmacologic therapies include sleep hygiene, cognitive behavior therapy, relaxation therapy, multicomponent therapy, and paradoxical intention. Referral to a sleep specialist may be considered for refractory cases. Copyright (C) 2015 American Academy of Family Physicians.)

AB Background: The physiological changes of pregnancy may predispose females to develop restless legs syndrome (RLS). Studies evaluating outcomes of RLS symptoms in pregnancy are scarce.
   Objectives: We examined the risk of preterm birth in pregnant women with and without restless legs syndrome (RLS).
   Materials and Methods: A cohort study included 231 pregnant women attending Ardabil health care centers for prenatal care and delivery in the period of 2010, without any risk factors for preterm delivery and low birth weight. The instruments used were questionnaires about RLS, the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), demographic data, and hemoglobin values. Data were analyzed via SPSS software using descriptive statistics, the t-test, chi(2), Fisher's exact test, Pearson's correlation, and the Mann-Whitney U test.
   Results: RLS complicated 43.7 percent of pregnancies. Sleepiness (ESS score >8) was reported in 36.4% of the subjects with preterm birth and 35.9% of the term group. No significant correlation was found between the ESS score and the term and preterm groups (P = 0.843). The prevalence of preterm birth in the subjects with and without RLS was 69.7% and 30.3%, respectively. As a result, it significantly increased in the RLS group (P = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Pregnancies complicated by RLS are at increased risk for preterm birth. The improved sleep health of pregnant women could decrease pregnancy complications.

AB Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is very common during pregnancy, and is most likely explained by hormonal, physiological and physical changes. Maternal obesity, one of the major risk factors for SDB, together with physiological changes in pregnancy may predispose women to develop SDB. SDB has been associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes. Thus, early identification, diagnosis and treatment of SDB are important in pregnancy. This article reviews the pregnancy-related changes affecting the severity of SDB, the epidemiology and the risk factors of SDB in pregnancy, the association of SDB with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and screening and management options specific for this population.

AB Background: Exposure to unhealthy and unsafe environments cause 1 in 4 deaths in childhood each year. Early exposure to lead beginning prenatally and continuing throughout childhood is one of the mechanisms associated with unhealthy and unsafe environments, particularly in industrial countries and urban communities. Lead is a known heavy metal that crosses the placenta and blood-brain barrier depositing in fetal tissues.
   Purpose: The purpose of this integrative review was to determine which maternal-fetal dyads were at high risk for elevated umbilical cord lead (Pb2+) levels and to examine the consequences associated with elevated umbilical cord Pb2+ levels. Search Strategy: PubMed was searched to obtain English language publications from 2005 to March 2015 for studies examining the effects of prenatal lead exposure on infant outcomes using key terms "lead" combined with "infant." A total of 17 articles were retained for analysis.
   Findings: Infants with elevated umbilical cord blood lead levels were associated with maternal demographic factors and country of origin. Maternal-specific exposure to lead products prior to or during pregnancy was associated with elevated umbilical cord blood lead levels. The consequences of prenatal lead exposure to the infant at birth anthropometrically were mixed. The evidence on neurological consequences of prenatal exposure to lead appears to reflect changes in cognitive impairment; however, it needs further study.
   Implications for Practice: The major recommendation is primary prevention of lead exposure across the life span. Implementation of policies that reduce the availability of leaded products to reduce leaded products, especially ones aimed at children and women of childbearing age.
   Implications for Research: Research needs to be focused in 2 directions: (1) prevention of lead exposure during pregnancy and (2) prevention of lead leaching from bones for all women of childbearing age.

AB Background: Postnatal depression affects the well-being of women and families. While several studies have shown an association between mode of birth and symptoms of postnatal depression, others have found no relationship.
   Aims: To determine whether women who have instrumental or caesarean births report higher levels of poor coping, sleep or appetite disturbance, or relationship difficulties, than women who have vaginal births, at the time of Universal Postnatal Contact (7-10 days post-discharge).
   Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort study of term, singleton births from 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2013 at a tertiary obstetric facility. Outcomes were compared for 1816 women having vaginal births versus 1205 women having instrumental or caesarean births.
   Results: When adjusted for confounders, no association could be demonstrated between mode of birth and reporting of any postnatal symptom of psychological morbidity. However, the model did demonstrate an association between reporting of symptoms and nulliparity (aOR 1.69 (1.08-2.63); P = 0.02), as well as having an unplanned pregnancy with a supportive partner (aOR 0.54 (0.29-0.97); P = 0.04).
   Conclusions: Mode of birth does not appear to be associated with the reporting of symptoms of psychological morbidity in the early postnatal period. However, these symptoms may be associated with nulliparity and in the context of an unplanned pregnancy, a lack of partner support. These findings highlight the ongoing need for antenatal screening with respect to pregnancy intention and the presence of a social support system, to facilitate the implementation of interventions for women at risk of postnatal depression.
