N2  - In “Long-term cerebral white and gray matter changes after preeclampsia,” the authors found that preeclampsia was associated with chronic temporal lobe white matter changes and reduced cortical volume in young women; the changes were consistent with persistent inflammation. Culebras proposes that sleep apnea may be a contributing factor as pregnancy increases the risk of sleep apnea, which leads to inflammation and vascular morbidities, all of which may persist after pregnancy. Siepmann et al. note that recent research shows an increased risk of stroke in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, possibly facilitated by intermittent hypoxia and vascular dysregulation. In “The autism ‘epidemic’: Ethical, legal, and social issues in a developmental spectrum disorder,” the authors emphasized the importance of early screening and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Machado et al. recommend assessing anatomic brain connectivity using the diffusion-weighted MRI technique and functional brain connectivity using EEG coherence calculations as part of the ASD diagnostic workup.

N2  - Comments on an article by Timo Siepmann et al. (see record 2017-14224-009). The article by Siepmann et al. identified long-term cerebral white matter changes and reduced cortical volume, presumably of vascular origin, in young women after pregnancy complicated bypreeclampsia. The authors invoked persistent inflammation as the putative agent. Sleep apnea may be a link among pregnancy, preeclampsia, and cerebrovascular disease. During the third trimester of pregnancy, the growth of the fetus restricts sleep respiratory function,particularly in obese women. Ten percent of pregnant women have sleep apnea, a condition that raises blood pressure, increases the level of inflammation, and leads topreeclampsia. Sleep apnea may persist after pregnancy, sustaining the post-preeclampsia vascular risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - In the past three decades, rates of overweight and obesity among children have substantially increased worldwide, with all but the poorest countries now struggling with a high prevalence of obesity and its related noncommunicable diseases. In the United States alone, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents is 32%. Although obesity prevalence among some U.S. subpopulations appear to have stabilized, overall rates remain at historically high rates and racial/ethnic differences appear to be widening, particularly among Latino children. The elevated prevalence of overweight and obesity even among children ages 2-5 years has led to a growing recognition that risk factors in early life may be crucial to the development—and therefore the prevention—of obesity and its consequences. Epidemiological studies suggest that adverse exposures in pregnancy, such as intrauterine exposure to maternal smoking, excessive weight gain, or elevated glucose levels, and, in early childhood, rapid infant weight gain, poor feeding practices, too much television viewing, and short sleep duration, may increase short- and long-term risks for obesity and its sequelae. For these reasons, national reports emphasize the important role of early-life risk factors in obesity development and the need for interventions in early life to prevent obesity.

N2  - This review aims to evaluate the performance of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening questionnaires during pregnancy. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using MEDLINE Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library. A bivariate meta-analysis was applied for pooling of diagnostic parameters. Six of the total 4719 articles met the inclusion criteria. The Berlin questionnaire (BQ, N = 604) and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS, N = 420) were the most frequently used screening tools during pregnancy. The pooled prevalence of OSA during pregnancy was 26.7% (95%CI: 16.9%, 34.4%, I² = 83.15%). BQ performance was poor to fair with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.66 (95%CI: 0.45, 0.83; I² = 78.65%) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.75; I² = 81.55%), respectively. BQ performance was heterogeneous depending on type of reference test and pregnancy. Sensitivity increased if diagnosis was based on polysomnography (0.90), and respiratory disturbance index (0.90). However, sensitivity decreased if screening was performed in early pregnancy (≤20 weeks gestation: 0.47), and high-risk pregnancy (0.44). Performance of ESS was poor with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.44 (95%CI: 0.33, 0.56; I² = 32.8%) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.75; I² = 81.55%), respectively. In conclusion, BQ and ESS showed poor performance during pregnancy, hence a new OSA screening questionnaire is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The purpose of this study was to reveal the cross-sectional and longitudinal association of sleep with depression and anxiety among Chinese pregnant women. Pregnant women were recruited in Zhoushan Pregnant Women Cohort at Zhoushan Maternal and Child Care Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Self-rating depression scales (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scales (SAS) were used for evaluating depression and anxiety status at each trimester; corresponding sleep quality and duration were reported by pregnant women. Ordinary or multilevel linear and logistic regression model were used to estimate the cross-sectional or longitudinal association of sleep with depression and anxiety. The prevalence rates were 35.64, 24.23, and 26.24% for depression and 22.57, 17.41, and 21.04% for anxiety at 1st (T1), 2nd (T2), and 3rd trimester (T3), respectively. Controlling for potential confounders, it revealed significant cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of sleep with depression and anxiety status. In cross-sectional analysis, women who slept less than 8 h/day had higher risk of depression (T1: OR (95%CI) = 1.75 (1.39, 2.20); T2: 1.52 (1.26, 2.05); T3: 1.60 (1.18, 2.05)) and anxiety (T1: 2.00 (1.57, 2.55); T2: 1.86 (1.37, 2.54); T3: 1.33 (0.99, 1.79)). In the longitudinal analysis, multilevel model revealed that women with subjective “fair” or “bad” sleep quality had elevated risk of depression (OR ranging from 1.54 to 3.71) and anxiety (2.38 to 7.53) during pregnancy. Prenatal depression and anxiety status were prevalent in pregnant women. Sleep quality was associated with depression and anxiety status in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, implying that improving sleep quality should benefit for mental health of pregnant women.

N2  - Given that data assessing the heterogeneity of infant care practices among Hispanics are lacking, the objective of this study was to assess the association between maternal birth country and adherence to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) safe sleep recommendations in a national sample of Hispanic mothers. We used a stratified, 2-stage, clustered design to obtain a nationally representative sample of mothers from 32 U.S. intrapartum hospitals. 907 completed follow-up surveys (administered 2-6 months postpartum) were received from mothers who self-identified as Hispanic/Latina, forming our sample, which we divided into 4 subpopulations by birth country (U.S., Mexico, Central/South America, and Caribbean). Prevalence estimates and aORs were determined for infant sleep position, location, breastfeeding, and maternal smoking. When compared with U.S.-born mothers, we found that: mothers born in the Caribbean (aOR 4.56, 95% CI 1.07-19.5) and Central/South America (aOR 2.68, 95% CI 1.38-5.22) were more likely to room share without bed sharing. Caribbean-born mothers were less likely to place infants to sleep supine (aOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22-0.77). Mothers born in Mexico (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.03-2.72) and Central/South America (aOR 2.57, 95% CI 1.09-6.07) were more likely to exclusively breastfeed; Caribbean-born mothers (aOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.63) were less likely to do so. Foreign-born mothers were significantly less likely to smoke before and during pregnancy. In conclusion, among U.S. Hispanics, adherence to AAP safe sleep recommendations varies widely by maternal birth country. These data illustrate the importance of examining behavioral heterogeneity among ethnic groups and have potential relevance for developing targeted interventions for safe infant sleep.

N2  - Insomnia and disturbed sleep are common during pregnancy. This study investigated the effectiveness of group cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) delivered in pregnancy. Thirteen pregnant women with insomnia participated in five weekly CBT-I group sessions. All participants completed the study and provided baseline and follow-up data. Significant reductions in insomnia symptoms and increases in subjective sleep quality were observed over the course of the study. Diary and actigraphy assessments of sleep also changed, such that participants reported less time in bed (TIB), shorter sleep onset latency (SOL), increased sleep efficiency (SE), and increased subjective total sleep time (TST). Additionally, symptoms of depression, pregnancy-specific anxiety, and fatigue all decreased over the course of treatment. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large. CBT-I delivered during pregnancy was associated with significant improvements in sleep and mood. The next step in this area of inquiry is to better establish effectiveness via a randomized controlled trial. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Psychosocial stress during pregnancy has been proposed as a major contributor of glucocorticoid-mediated programming of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, with later adverse health consequences. However, evidence linking maternal stress to maternal cortisol values during pregnancy is inconclusive. A possible explanation for this is that other maternal factors overshadow any potential effects of stress on cortisol levels. We studied a large cohort of pregnant women with extensive data on pregnancy characteristics to determine the respective contributions of biological, environmental and psychosocial stress factors to cortisol levels in pregnancy. Methods: We used data from 3039 women from the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development-study cohort. Serum cortisol was measured in blood, collected at the first prenatal visit, at different gestational ages (median = 91days, range = 40–256days), and at various time points during the day (median = 11:45h, range = 08:00–18:30h). We assessed associations between maternal serum cortisol in pregnancy and biological factors, lifestyle factors and stress factors, including depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, work stress, parenting stress and fatigue. Results: In multivariable analysis, variables that were associated with higher cortisol levels in pregnancy were lower maternal age [1.5nmol/l, 95%CI (0.6–2.4)], being nulliparous [21.5 nmol/l (15.9–27.1)], lower pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) [1.3nmol/l (0.3–2.4)], higher C-reactive protein (CRP) [1.0nmol/l (0.4–1.5)], carrying a female fetus [9.2nmol/l (1.8–16.5)], non-smoking [14.2nmol/l (0.6–27.7)], sufficient sleep [8.5nmol/l (0.9–16.1)], and being unemployed [12.7nmol/l (2.2–23.2)]. None of the psychosocial stressors was significantly associated with serum cortisol levels in pregnancy. A total of 32% of all variance in cortisol was explained by gestational age, maternal age, time of day, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, CRP, fetal sex, smoking behavior, self-reported sleep sufficiency, and employment. Conclusions: Our data suggest that maternal cortisol during pregnancy is mainly affected by biological and lifestyle factors, but not by psychosocial factors. We suggest that psychosocial stress in pregnancy might program the fetus through other mechanisms than through altering maternal cortisol levels.

N2  - From the perspective of circadian biology, mammalian pregnancy presents an unusual biological scenario in which an entire circadian system (i.e., that of the fetus) is embodied within another (i.e., that of the mother). Moreover, both systems are likely to be influenced at their interface by a third player, the placenta. Successful pregnancy requires major adaptations in maternal physiology, many of which involve circadian changes that support the high metabolic demands of the growing fetus. A functional role for maternal circadian adaptations is implied by the effects of circadian disruption, which result in pregnancy complications including higher risks for miscarriage, preterm labor, and low birth weight. Various aspects of fetal physiology lead to circadian variation, at least in late gestation, but it remains unclear what drives this rhythmicity. It likely involves contributions from the maternal environment and possibly from the placenta and the developing intrinsic molecular clocks within fetal tissues. The role of the placenta is of particular significance because it serves not only to relay signals about the external environment (via the mother) but may also exhibit its own circadian rhythmicity. This review considers how the fetus may be influenced by dynamic circadian signals from the mother and the placenta during gestation, and how, in the face of these changing influences, a new fetal circadian system emerges. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of endocrine signals, most notably melatonin and glucocorticoids, as mediators of maternal-fetal circadian interactions, and on the expression of the clock gene in the 3 compartments. Further study is required to understand how the mother, placenta, and fetus interact across pregnancy to optimize circadian adaptations that support adequate growth and development of the fetus and its transition to postnatal life in a circadian environment.

N2  - There have been many studies written about Latino women living with postpartum depression, but not perinatal depression. The purpose of this study was to document the everyday lived experiences of Latina women who survived peripartum depression, and to understand their help seeking behaviors and coping strategies. This study used transcendental phenomenology as a research design, as it sets aside prejudgments regarding the phenomenon being investigated. For this study, 15 Latina women who recalled their lived experience of peripartum depression served as the participants. Three themes emerged from the research conducted: 1) the lived experience of peripartum depression, 2) risk factors during pregnancy and after childbirth and; 3) personal experience of wellbeing. The symptomologies present in majority of the participants in this study included incongruent thoughts, flashbacks and the re-experience of traumas occurring prior to their pregnancy. These emotional triggers resulted in sleep deprivation, lethargy, crying spells and extreme fluctuations in mood. A common theme among all the participants was that depression was exacerbated due to opposing desires to honor the tenets of Mariansimo, while assimilating in North American culture that emphasize, "a woman should have it all." On the other hand, there were participants who, despite cultural traditions, sought professional help for their deepening depression. The result - several participants experienced a lack of sensitivity from medical providers. This led to suspiciousness of professional providers and a lack of trust, thereby impacting compliance with medical appointments and implementation of medical advice.

N2  - In two studies, the relationship between sleep and working memory performance was investigated in children born very preterm (i.e., gestation less than 32 weeks) and the possible mechanisms underlying this relationship. In Study 1, parent-reported measures of snoring, night-time sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness were collected on 89 children born very preterm aged 6 to 7 years. The children completed a verbal working memory task, as well as measures of processing speed and verbal storage capacity. Night-time sleep quality was found to be associated with verbal working memory performance over and above the variance associated with individual differences in processing speed and storage capacity, suggesting that poor sleep may have an impact on the executive component of working memory. Snoring and daytime sleepiness were not found to be associated with working memory performance. Study 2 introduced a direct measure of executive functioning and examined whether sleep problems would differentially impact the executive functioning of children born very preterm relative to children born to term. Parent-reported sleep problems were collected on 43 children born very preterm and 48 children born to term (aged 6 to 9 years). Problematic sleep was found to adversely impact executive functioning in the very preterm group, while no effect of sleep was found in the control group. These findings implicate executive dysfunction as a possible mechanism by which problematic sleep adversely impacts upon cognition in children born very preterm, and suggest that sleep problems can increase the cognitive vulnerability already experienced by many of these children.

N2  - Background: Women's sleep needs increase during pregnancy. Most pregnant women need more sleep than the 7-8 hours needed by non-pregnant individuals. One-quarter to one-third of pregnant women experience short sleep duration (<7 hours) as early as the first trimester; with the proportion experiencing shortened sleep duration increasing as pregnancy progresses. Limited evidence suggests that self-reported shortened sleep duration (SRSSD) in pregnancy adversely affects maternal cardiometabolic and infant birth outcomes. The purpose of this study is to determine if SRSSD is independently associated with clinically diagnosed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), incident hypertension in pregnancy, preeclampsia, preterm birth (PTB) or small for gestational age (SGA). Sample and Design: Data was derived from the Pregnancy and Influenza Study (PIP), a prospective, observational cohort of pregnant women receiving prenatal care through two managed health care systems. Data from a subset of PIP enrollees (n=1271) were obtained from enrollment interviews, and electronic medical records. Univariate associations between SRSSD and dependent clinical outcomes, between SRSSD and covariates, and between clinical outcomes and covariates was conducted using Pearson chi-squared (chi 2) tests. Multinomial logistic regression models were conducted for each outcome. Analyses were conducted with SPSS version 21(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Results: The majority of women reported sleeping seven to nine hours a night (69%). SRSSD was reported by 11% of respondents. Factors associated with SRSSD at a p value <0.05 included maternal age at conception, race/ethnicity, education, cohabiting with a spouse or partner, and smoke exposure. Percentages of women with selected outcomes were: GDM (9%); incident hypertension in pregnancy (7%); preeclampsia (3%), preterm (3%) and SGA (6%). In logistic regression models, SRSSD was not associated with clinically diagnosed GDM (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-1.98), incident hypertension in pregnancy (aOR 0.69, CI 0.29-1.66), preeclampsia, (aOR 1.54 CI 0.56-4.25), PTB (aOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.25-2.98) or SGA (aOR 1.39, 95% CI 0.86-2.70). Conclusion: Results from this analysis did not find associations between SRSSD and clinically diagnosed GDM, incident hypertension in pregnancy, preeclampsia, PTB or SGA. Further research is needed on the effects of sleep duration and adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Up to 18% of men experience depression and/or anxiety during the transition to parenthood. Interventions designed specifically to promote the mental health of men during the transition to parenthood are scarce. Internet-delivered interventions may be acceptable and far-reaching in enhancing mental health, parenting knowledge, and healthy behaviors in expectant or new fathers. Objective: To guide the development of Healthydads.ca, a website designed to enhance mental health and healthy behaviors in expectant fathers, a needs assessment was conducted to identify fathers’ perspectives of barriers to seeking help for emotional wellness, informational needs, and factors affecting the decision to visit such a website. Methods: One hundred and seventy-four men whose partners were expecting, or had recently given birth, in 3 Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta) completed a Web-based survey inquiring about information needs related to psychosocial aspects of the transition to parenthood, lifestyle behaviors, parenting, and factors associated with the decision to visit a father-focused website. Results: Most men (155/174, 89.1%) reported accessing the Internet to obtain information on pregnancy and spent an average of 6.2 hours online per month. Seeking information about parenting on the Internet was reported by 67.2% (117/174) of men, with a mean of 4.4 hours per month of online searching. Top barriers to seeking help to improve emotional wellness during the perinatal period were: no time to seek help/assistance (130/174, 74.7%), lack of resources available in the health care system (126/174, 72.4%), financial costs associated with services (118/174, 67.8%), and feeling that one should be able to do it alone (113/174, 64.9%). Information needs that were rated highly included: parenting/infant care (52.9-81.6%), supporting (121/174, 69.5%) and improving (124/174, 71.3%) relationship with their partner, work-family balance (120/174, 69.0%), improving sleep (100/174, 57.5%), and managing stress (98/174, 56.3%). Perceiving the website as personally relevant (151/174, 86.8%), credible (141/174, 81.0%), effective (140/145, 80.5%), and having an easy navigation structure (141/174, 81.0%) were identified as important factors related to a first website visit. Providing useful (134/174, 77.0%) and easy to understand (158/174, 90.8%) information, which was also free of charge (156/174, 89.7%), were considered important for deciding to prolong a website visit. Providing the possibility to post questions to a health professional (133/174, 76.4%), adding new content regularly (119/174, 68.4%), and personal motivation (111/174, 63.8%) were factors identified that would encourage a revisit. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that there is substantial interest among expectant and new fathers for using Internet-delivered strategies to prepare for the transition to parenthood and support their mental health. Specific user and website features were identified to optimize the use of father-focused websites. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction: Malaria is a major public health problem and life-threatening disease. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), roughly 400 children die every day and almost half of these deaths are attributable to malaria. Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children under age 5 in the DRC, accounting for an estimated 40% of outpatient visits and 40% of childhood mortality. The purpose of this study was to examine whether malaria control methods (i.e., insecticide bed net use and taking sp/fansidar or chloroquine for malaria) differed based on perceived problems preventing pregnant women from seeking medical advice or treatment (big problem, not a big problem), receipt of prenatal care (no, yes) and source of prenatal care (e.g., doctor), and sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: A secondary data analysis of pregnant women (n = 2,404) who completed the Demographic and Health Survey in the DRC (DHS-DRC7) was conducted. Results: Results indicated that use of a mosquito bed net, taking sp/fansidar, and taking chloroquine for malaria significantly differed among pregnant women based on educational attainment, ethnicity, and wealth index. Pregnant women who did not sleep under a bed net were more likely to not receive ANC (p = .002), including 1.95 times more likely (p = .002) to not receive care from a doctor than pregnant women who did not sleep under a mosquito net. Pregnant women who did not take sp/fansidar for malaria during pregnancy were more likely to perceive that distance to a health facility (p < .001) and not wanting to go alone (p = .009) were big problems for getting medical help for themselves. Pregnant women who did not take sp/fansidar during pregnancy were more likely to not receive care from a doctor (p = .01), nurse (p = .002) or birth attendant (p < .001). Pregnant women who did not take chloroquine for malaria while pregnant were 3.6 times more likely (p = .04) to not receive care from a doctor. Discussion: Awareness of malaria control methods is critical in shaping the necessary interventions and policies toward the control of such diseases and addressing this global health disparity. The study found several healthcare utilization factors related to malaria control methods among pregnant women in the DRC. Next steps include enhancement of education among pregnant women about malaria control methods and access to care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To quantify the quality of life (QoL) and visit-specific satisfaction of pregnant women. Design: A prospective cohort within a practice-based research network (PBRN). Setting/Locations: Individual chiropractic offices. Subjects: Pregnant women (age ≥18 years) attending chiropractic care. Intervention(s): Chiropractic care (i.e., The Webster Technique, spinal adjustments, and adjunctive therapies). Main outcome measures: The RAND VSQ9 to measure visit-specific satisfaction and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®)-29 to measure QoL. Results: A convenience sample of 343 pregnant patients (average age = 30.96 years) comprised their study population. They were highly educated with 75% attaining a 2-year associate's degree or higher. The pregnant patients presented for chiropractic care with a mean week of gestation of 25.67 weeks (median = 28 weeks; range = 0–42 weeks) and parity (i.e., the number of live births) of 0.92 live births (median = 1; range = 0–6). From baseline (i.e., at study entrance with minimum first visit) and comparative (i.e., following a course of chiropractic care), the VSQ9 measurements revealed increasingly high satisfaction on the part of the subjects (i.e., the mean difference of baseline minus comparative measures = −0.7322; p p p p p p p = 0.1404) or depression (p = 0.8785) changed. Conclusion: A PBRN study was successfully implemented among chiropractors to find pregnant patients highly satisfied and their QoL scores improving with care beyond chance.

N2  - Day-night cycled light improves health outcomes in preterm infants, yet the best time to institute cycled light is unclear. The hypothesis of this study was that extremely preterm infants receiving early cycled light would have better health and developmental outcomes than infants receiving late cycled light. Infants born at 28 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to early cycled light (ECL) starting at 28 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA] or late cycled light (LCL), starting at 36 weeks PMA. Daylight was 200–600 lux and night was 5–30 lux. Primary outcomes were weight over time and length of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were hospital costs, sleep development, and neurodevelopment at 9, 18, and 24 months corrected age. Of 121 infants randomized, 118 were included in analysis. Weight gain in the two groups did not differ significantly but increased across time in both groups. In PMA weeks 36–44, the mean weight gain was 193.8 grams in the ECL group compared to 176.3 grams in the LCL group. Effect sizes for weight were Cohen d = 0.26 and 0.36 for 36 and 44 weeks PMA. Infants in the ECL group went home an average of 5.5 days earlier than the LCL group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were no group differences on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although statistically non-significant, clinically important differences of improved weight gain and decreased hospital stay were observed with ECL. The small observed effect sizes on weight during hospitalization should be considered in future cycled light research with extremely preterm infants.

N2  - This systematic review summarizes the existing data on headache and pregnancy with a scope on clinical headache phenotypes, treatment of headaches in pregnancy and effects of headache medications on the child during pregnancy and breastfeeding, headache related complications, and diagnostics of headache in pregnancy. Headache during pregnancy can be both primary and secondary, and in the last case can be a symptom of a life-threatening condition. The most common secondary headaches are stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, choriocarcinoma, eclampsia, preeclampsia, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Migraine is a risk factor for pregnancy complications, particularly vascular events. Data regarding other primary headache conditions are still scarce. Early diagnostics of the disease manifested by headache is important for mother and fetus life. It is especially important to identify “red flag symptoms” suggesting that headache is a symptom of a serious disease. In order to exclude a secondary headache additional studies can be necessary: electroencephalography, ultrasound of the vessels of the head and neck, brain MRI and MR angiography with contrast ophthalmoscopy and lumbar puncture. During pregnancy and breastfeeding the preferred therapeutic strategy for the treatment of primary headaches should always be a non-pharmacological one. Treatment should not be postponed as an undermanaged headache can lead to stress, sleep deprivation, depression and poor nutritional intake that in turn can have negative consequences for both mother and baby. Therefore, if non-pharmacological interventions seem inadequate, a well-considered choice should be made concerning the use of medication, taking into account all the benefits and possible risks.

N2  - Background: Evidence suggests a relation between plasma tryptophan concentrations and sleep and mental wellbeing. As no studies have been performed in pregnant women, we studied the relation of plasma tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy with sleep quality, and mood during and after pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (n = 572) from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes study completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at 26–28 weeks gestation and three months post-delivery. Plasma tryptophan concentrations were measured at 26–28 weeks gestation. Poisson regressions estimated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association between tryptophan and poor sleep quality (PSQI global score > 5), probable antenatal depression (EPDS ≥ 15) and probable anxiety (STAI-state ≥ 41) were calculated adjusting for covariates. Results: Mean plasma tryptophan concentrations was 48.0 μmol/L (SD: 8.09). Higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a lower prevalence of antenatal poor sleep quality adjusting for covariates [PR: 0.88 (95% CI 0.80, 0.97) per 10 μmol/L], especially in those participants who also suffered from anxiety symptoms [PR: 0.80 (95% CI 0.67, 0.95)]. No associations were observed between tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy and postnatal sleep quality or mental well-being. Limitation: Subjective measures were used to assess sleep and mental well-being. Conclusions: We observed that higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a 12% lower prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy, in particular among those with anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest the importance of having adequate tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Women with bipolar disorder are at high risk of affective psychoses following childbirth (i.e. “postpartum psychosis”, PP) and there is a need to identify which factors underlie this increased risk. Vulnerability to mood dysregulation following sleep loss may influence risk of PP, as childbirth is typified by sleep disruption. We investigated whether a history of mood episodes triggered by sleep loss was associated with PP in women with bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: Participants were 870 parous women with BD recruited to the Bipolar Disorder Research Network. Lifetime diagnoses of BD and perinatal episodes were identified via interview and case notes. Information on whether mood episodes had been triggered by sleep loss was derived at interview. Rates of PP were compared between women who did and did not report mood episodes following sleep loss. Results: Women who reported sleep loss triggering episodes of mania were twice as likely to have experienced an episode of PP (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.47–2.97, p < 0.001) compared to women who did not report this. There was no significant association between depression triggered by sleep loss and PP (p = 0.526). Limitations: Data were cross-sectional therefore may be subject to recall bias. We also did not have objective data on sleep disruption that had occurred during the postpartum period or prior to mood episodes. Conclusions: In clinical practice, a history of mania following sleep loss could be a marker of increased vulnerability to PP, and should be discussed with BD women who are pregnant or planning to conceive.

N2  - Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suffer from concurrent medical symptoms, including gastrointestinal (GI) and sleeping problems. However, there is limited information on the correlation between co-morbidities and autistic behavioral symptoms. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of GI and sleep problems in Chinese ASD children, examined the impacts of GI and sleep problems on autistic behavioral symptoms, and investigated the factors associated with GI and sleep problems. The survey included 169 ASD and 172 healthy children. Data regarding demographic characteristics, GI symptoms, sleep disturbances and behavioral symptoms were collected through questionnaires. GI and sleep problems were prevalent in Chinese ASD children. Moreover, ASD children with GI symptoms reported more severe ASD core symptoms than others. Autistic children's GI symptoms were associated with maternal sleep problems during pregnancy, child's 0–6 month food sources and picky eating. ASD children with sleep disturbances had lower performance in daily living skills, social cognition, social communication and intellectual development than ASD children without sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances were associated with extra nutrient supply during lactation and feeding, and child's picky eating. Autistic children with GI or/and sleep problems may represent clinically relevant subtypes of ASD, for which targeted treatments may be needed.

N2  - This cross-sectional study aims to determine the prevalence and determinants of depressive symptoms in first -time expectant fathers during their partner’s third trimester of pregnancy. As part of a prospective study examining depressive symptoms in men over the first postnatal year, 622 men (mean age = 34.3 years, ± 5.0 years) completed standardized online self-report questionnaires measuring depressed mood, physical activity, sleep quality, social support, marital adjustment, life events, financial stress, and demographics during their partner’s third trimester of pregnancy. The Edinburgh Depression Scale was used to assess depressed mood. Partners also completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale in the third trimester. The results revealed that 13.3% of expectant fathers exhibited elevated levels of depressive symptoms during their partner’s third trimester of pregnancy. Significant independent factors associated with antenatal depressive symptoms in men were poorer sleep quality, family history of psychological difficulties, lower perceived social support, poorer marital satisfaction, more stressful life events in the preceding 6 months, greater number of financial stressors, and elevated maternal antenatal depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of including fathers in the screening and early prevention efforts targeting depression during the transition to parenthood, which to date have largely focused only on women. Strategies to promote better sleep, manage stress, and mobilize social support may be important areas to address in interventions tailored to new fathers at risk for depression during the transition to parenthood.

N2  - Dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been suggested as a potential mechanism linking sleep and cardiometabolic disorders. However, the associations of two primary outputs of the HPA axis, cortisol and its antagonist dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), with sleep are less well studied. In the Nurses' Health Study II, 233 postmenopausal women provided five timed saliva samples over one day (immediately upon waking, 45 min, 4 h, and 10 h after waking, and prior to going to sleep) to measure cortisol and DHEA. Of these, 209 completed assessment of their habitual sleep patterns using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We used piecewise linear mixed models to compare cross-sectional associations of slopes reflecting diurnal cortisol and DHEA rhythms with overall sleep quality and with seven sub-components. Overall, we observed no differences in the diurnal patterns of cortisol or DHEA between good versus poor sleepers as assessed by the global PSQI score. However, longer sleep latency was associated with significantly reduced cortisol awakening rise (p = 0.02). Poorer subjective sleep quality (p = 0.02), shorter sleep duration (p = 0.02), and lower sleep efficiency (p = 0.03) were associated with slower rate of cortisol decline later in the day. Women reporting daytime dysfunction had a sharper cortisol decline early in the day (p = 0.03) but a flattened decline later in the day (p = 0.01). The differences in diurnal patterns of DHEA between good versus poor sleepers, though less pronounced, were similar in direction to those of cortisol. Self-reported sleep duration, efficiency, latency and daytime dysfunction were associated with altered diurnal rhythms of cortisol and, to a lesser extent, DHEA. These findings provide support for the interplay between sleep and the HPA axis that may contribute to cardiometabolic disease. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction: The present study focuses on mother's spontaneous touch during the very first skin to skin kangaroo care with premature babies in NICU. The aim is to test the hypothesis according to which, compared to the usual installation where the baby is installed vertically in the mother's clothes between the breast, the innovative installation in Supported diagonal flexion (FDS) fosters a more positive qualitative mother's touch, a touch dedicated more to enriching and scaffolding interactions with the preemie and less focused on postural support. Method: Twenty very preterm infants between 27 and 31 weeks gestation and their mothers were offered skin to skin sessions. The first 10 infants included were offered the usual vertical positioning and a breastfeeding pillow for support. The following ten were offered SDF. The first five minutes of the session were videotaped and coded with The Observer software. Results: In the usual vertical positioning mother's hands were used 59% of the time to maintain infant posture (hold or contain infant's body), therefore using touch for mechanical reasons (vs 1% in SDF positioning; 95% CI 47.2–67.2). With the SDF positioning, mothers used their hands for affective touch (36% vs 20% in the usual vertical positioning; 95% CI 5.3–30.0) and to signal presence (39% vs 20% in the usual vertical positioning; 95% CI 7.8–31.4). Infants were mostly in active sleep, and drowsiness was lowered in the FDS group as compared to the “as usual” one. There was no quiet awake or active awake state during skin to skin's SDF positioning sessions. Our results also showed that affective touch took place on the head in the vertical group whereas it was more frequently directed on the face in the SDF group. Mothers in the SDF group tended spontaneously more to rock their baby. Conclusion: With SDF positioning, mothers spontaneously used more active touch and expressed more affection through touch. The present study is part of a longitudinal follow-up from birth until 3 months corrected age. The vocal production and visual engagement of both partners are under analysis and will be considered in the light of the mothering touch interactions described here. Further research to describe interactions in all of their dimensions is necessary. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Small for gestational age (SGA; defined as birth weight less than 10th percentile for the population) neonates are at higher risk of delayed neuronal maturation and short and long term adverse neurocognitive outcomes compared to their appropriate gestational age (AGA) counterparts. Amplitude integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), a simplified bedside tool for measuring brain function in neonates, has been shown to undergo a distinctive postnatal maturation in preterm infants. There is no information if being SGA affects the postnatal maturation of aEEG in preterm infants. Objectives: To compare the postnatal maturation of aEEG during the first two weeks of life in preterm SGA and AGA infants born between 30 and 34 weeks' gestation. Outcome measures: Primary: the aEEG maturation score as defined by Burdjalov et al consisting of sum of individual scores of four parameters namely continuity, sleep wake cycle, band width, and amplitude of lower border of the traces recorded on 3rd, 7th and 14th postnatal days of life. Secondary: individual scores of four parameters namely continuity, sleep wake cycle, band width, and amplitude of lower border of the traces recorded on 3rd, 7th and 14th postnatal days of life. Study design: Prospective double cohort study. Methods: We recruited 19 SGA and 21 AGA stable infants born at 30 to 34 weeks of gestation at the tertiary care neonatal unit in All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. We performed serial aEEGs in all the enrolled infants at postnatal ages of 3rd, 7th and 14th days of life. The three blinded assessors assigned scores for the primary outcome using the validated score. Generalized estimating equation was performed to compare maturation scores between SGA and AGA groups. validated score. Generalized estimating equation was performed to compare maturation scores between SGA and AGA groups. Results: We analyzed a total of 117 aEEG recordings in 40 preterm babies. The baselines characteristics were comparable in the two groups except for birth weight (g; mean+/-SD in SGA vs AGA groups: 1186+/-263 vs 1666+/-230, p=0.00). The mean gestational age was comparable in two groups (31.9+1,3 vs 32.2+/-1,2, p=0.42). The aEEG maturation score increased in the AGA cohort from 3rd day through 14th day while in SGA cohort, it slightly declined on day 7 and increased by day 14 of life. The score in SGA cohort was slightly lower compared to AGA on day 7 (meaniSD: 8.6+/-2.4 vs 10.111.1, p=0.02) and at day 14 (10.2+/-1.3 vs 10.7+0.8, p=0.11). On an average at any time point during the first 14 days of life, the score lagged by 0.8 (Cl: -1.6 to -0.02, P=0.04) in SGA infants compared to AGA infants. Mean score for continuity was similar in two groups at all study time points, while that for cycling and lower border showed a significant difference at day 7 (p=0.03 each) but not at days 3 and 14. Mean score for bandwidth showed a significant difference at day 7 (p=0.05) and day 14 (p=0.03) but not at day 3 (p=0.6). Conclusion: The postnatal aEEG maturation in SGA compared to AGA infants born at gestation 30 to 34 weeks is delayed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The letter presents a study on A Behavioral Intervention for Insomnia Improves Blood Pressure. Insomnia is associated with sympathetic nervous system (SNS) arousal and hypertension. The authors tested whether improving sleep in individuals with insomnia affects blood pressure (BP). Fourteen adults with chronic insomnia completed the study (n=8 females; age: 46.6 ± 11.5 y; BMI: 26.8 ± 4.2 kg/m2). Exclusion criteria included sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), restless legs syndrome (RLS), narcolepsy, psychiatric/neurologic disorders, shiftwork, recent trans-meridian travel, those having a child at home who is younger than one-year-old, and current pregnancy. Wearing amber-tinted lenses as a behavioral intervention aimed at reducing exposure to pre-bedtime blue-wavelength light was found to reduce BP. This BP-lowering effect may have been caused by an improvement in sleep or by reducing stress/anxiety and SNS arousal. This approach should be tested in individuals with comorbid hypertension and insomnia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The placenta is important in providing a healthy environment for the fetus and plays a central role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE). Fetal and placental developments are influenced by epigenetic programming. There is some evidence that PE is controlled to an altered circadian homeostasis. In a nested case–control study embedded in the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort, we obtained placental tissue, umbilical cord leukocytes (UCL), and human umbilical venous endothelial cells of 13 early-onset PE, 16 late-onset PE and 83 controls comprising 36 uncomplicated and 47 complicated pregnancies, i.e. 27 fetal growth restricted and 20 spontaneous preterm birth. To investigate the associations between PE and the epigenetics of circadian clock and clock-controlled genes in placental and newborn tissues, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip and a candidate-gene approach using ANCOVA was applied on 939 CpGs of 39 circadian clock and clock-controlled genes. DNA methylation significantly differed in early-onset PE compared with spontaneous preterm birth at 6 CpGs in placental tissue (3.73E-5 ≤ p ≤ 0.016) and at 21 CpGs in UCL (1.09E-5≤ p ≤ 0.024). In early-onset PE compared with fetal growth restriction 2 CpGs in placental tissue (p p ≤ 0.049) were significantly different. Moreover, significantly different DNA methylation in early-onset PE compared with uncomplicated controls was shown at 6 CpGs in placental tissue (1.36E-4 ≤ p ≤ 0.045) and 11 CpGs in uncomplicated controls (2.52E-6≤ p ≤ 0.009). No significant associations were shown with late-onset PE between study groups or tissues. The most differentially methylated CpGs showed hypomethylation in placental tissue and hypermethylation in uncomplicated controls. In conclusion, DNA methylation of circadian clock and clock-controlled genes demonstrated most differences in UCL of early-onset PE compared with spontaneous preterm birth. Implications of the tissue-specific variations in epigenetic programming for circadian performance and long-term health need further investigation.

N2  - Recently there has been an increase in research focusing on the role of sleep in psychological disorders in adolescents and young adults due to both increases in risk-taking behaviors and continued brain development during this period. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to extend findings of a master's thesis suggesting a relationship between subjective and objective measures of sleep and externalizing disorders in young adults in a community setting to a vulnerable population (i.e., emerging adults born prematurely). Measures include sleep behavior (Actigraphy, PSQI), birth status, objective measures of impulsivity and risk-taking (CPT-II, BART, Eye-Tracking), and subjective measures of both internalizing and externalizing disorder traits (TriPM, BIS 11, PAI scales, BPS). A total of 227 participants completed the study, including 71 men (premature n = 32) and 156 women (premature n = 103). Participants in the sample showed high average percentages of sleep (M = 91.91%) and few participants reported clinically elevated scores on the measures (&le; 13.45%), as would be expected. Results extend previous findings that both externalizing (i.e., psychopathy as measured by the TriPM) and internalizing (i.e., depression as measured by the PAI) traits decrease subjective sleep quality (i.e., PSQI scores). Results show that on average women born prematurely report increased internalizing traits compared with full term women and men born preterm or full term; while men born prematurely report lower levels of antisocial traits and behaviors (i.e., more female typical) when compared to full term men but still higher levels compared to women born preterm or full term. Results further suggest that premature birth status is associated with significantly lower rates of antisocial traits, particularly when severity of premature birth increases (i.e., fewer weeks of gestation). The community population and birth status is often not of focus in sleep research with the exception of sleep disordered breathing, and thus findings add to our understanding of this vulnerable population in emerging adults born prematurely who are attending college.

N2  - An intact communication between circadian clocks and the stress system is important for maintaining physiological homeostasis under resting conditions and in response to external stimuli. There is accumulating evidence for a reciprocal interaction between both—from the systemic to the molecular level. Disruption of this interaction by external factors such as shiftwork, jetlag, or chronic stress increases the risk of developing metabolic, immune, or mood disorders. From experiments in rodents, we know that both systems maturate during the perinatal period. During that time, exogenous factors such as stress or alterations in the external photoperiod may critically affect—or program—physiological functions later in life. This developmental programming process has been attributed to maternal stress signals reaching the embryo, which lastingly change gene expression through the induction of epigenetic mechanisms. Despite the well-known function of the adult circadian system in temporal coordination of physiology and behavior, the role of maternal and embryonic circadian clocks during pregnancy and postnatal development is still poorly defined. A better understanding of the circadian-stress crosstalk at different periods of development may help to improve stress resistance and devise preventive and therapeutic strategies against chronic stress-associated disorders.

N2  - Background: For many women, pregnancy-related sleep disturbances and pregnancy-related anxiety change as pregnancy progresses and both are associated with lower maternal quality of life and less favorable birth outcomes. Thus, the interplay between these two problems across pregnancy is of interest. In addition, psychological resilience may explain individual differences in this association, as it may promote coping with both sleep disturbances and anxiety, and thereby reduce their mutual effects. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine whether sleep quality and sleep duration, and changes in sleep are associated with the level of and changes in anxiety during pregnancy. Furthermore, the study tested the moderating effect of resilience on these associations. Methods: At gestational weeks 14, 24, and 34, 532 pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study in Finland filled out questionnaires on general sleep quality, sleep duration and pregnancy-related anxiety; resilience was assessed in week 14. Results: Parallel process latent growth curve models showed that shorter initial sleep duration predicted a higher initial level of anxiety, and a higher initial anxiety level predicted a faster shortening of sleep duration. Changes in sleep duration and changes in anxiety over the course of pregnancy were not related. The predicted moderating effect of resilience was not found. Conclusions: The results suggested that pregnant women reporting anxiety problems should also be screened for sleeping problems, and vice versa, because women who experienced one of these pregnancy-related problems were also at risk of experiencing or developing the other problem.

N2  - Reports an error in "Immediate effects of phototherapy on sleep in very preterm neonates: An observational study" by Cremer Martin, Jost Kerstin, Anna Gensmer, Isabelle Pramana, Edgar Delgado‐Eckert, Urs Frey, Sven M. Schulzke and Alexandre N. Datta (Journal of Sleep Research, 2016[Oct][25], Vol 25[5], 517-523). In the original article, the p values and legend in figure 1 were incorrectly mentioned. The correct figure 1 is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-49625-003). Process C (internal clock) and Process S (sleep–wake homeostasis) are the basis of sleep–wake regulation. In the last trimester of pregnancy, foetal heart rate is synchronized with the maternal circadian rhythm. At birth, this interaction fails and an ultradian rhythm appears. Light exposure is a strong factor influencing the synchronization of sleep–wake processes. However, little is known about the effects of phototherapy on the sleep rhythm of premature babies. It was hypothesized that sleep in preterm infants would not differ during phototherapy, but that a maturation effect would be seen. Sleep states were studied in 38 infants born P = 0.083). Analysis of videos in infants not under phototherapy revealed an increase in time spent awake with increasing gestational age. The current data suggest that the ultradian rhythm of preterm infants seems to be independent of phototherapy, supporting the notion that sleep rhythm in this population is mainly driven by their internal clock.

N2  - Major depression occurs in 5–10% of pregnancies and is associated with many negative effects for mother and child, yet treatment options are scarce. To our knowledge, this is the first published randomised controlled trial on Internet delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) for this group. Objective: To test the efficacy of a pregnancy adapted version of an existing 10-week ICBT-program for depression as well as assessing acceptability and adherence Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: Online and telephone. Population or sample: Self-referred pregnant women (gestational week 10–28 at intake) currently suffering from major depressive disorder. Methods: 42 pregnant women (gestational week 12–28) with major depression were randomised to either treatment as usual (TAU) provided at their antenatal clinic or to ICBT as an add-on to usual care. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale-self report (MADRS-S). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and measures of anxiety and sleep were used. Credibility, satisfaction, adherence and utilization were also assessed. Results: The ICBT group had significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms post treatment (p g =1.21) and were more likely to be responders (i.e. achieve a statistically reliable improvement) (RR = 0.36; p = 0.004). Measures of treatment credibility, satisfaction, utilization, and adherence were comparable to implemented ICBT for depression. Limitations: Small sample size and no long-term evaluation. Conclusion: Pregnancy adapted ICBT for antenatal depression is feasible, acceptable and efficacious. These results need to be replicated in larger trials to validate these promising findings.

N2  - The organization of functional brain networks changes across human lifespan. The present study analyzed functional brain networks in healthy full‐term infants (N = 139) within 1–6 days from birth by measuring neural synchrony in EEG recordings during quiet sleep. Large‐scale phase synchronization was measured in six frequency bands with the Phase Lag Index. Macroscopic network organization characteristics were quantified by constructing unweighted minimum spanning tree graphs. The cortical networks in early infancy were found to be significantly more hierarchical and had a more cost‐efficient organization compared with MST of random control networks, more so in the theta and alpha than in other frequency bands. Frontal and parietal sites acted as the main hubs of these networks, the topological characteristics of which were associated with gestation age (GA). This suggests that individual differences in network topology are related to cortical maturation during the prenatal period, when functional networks shift from strictly centralized toward segregated configurations.

N2  - Pregnant women have a two- to threefold increased prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) compared to the general population, and the majority of RLS patients also experience periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). PLMS have been associated with sleep disturbance as well as autonomic heart rate and blood pressure responses; however, the prevalence, cause and significance of PLMS during pregnancy remain unknown. This study evaluated the presence of PLMS in late pregnancy and its relationship to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Ninety-one women in the third trimester of pregnancy underwent overnight polysomnography. An RLS questionnaire and the Multivariate Apnea Risk Index were administered and venous blood was sampled within 2 weeks of the sleep study. After exclusions due to obstructive sleep apnoea and signal loss, PLMS data were available for 73 women, 36 hypertensive women and 37 BMI- and gestation-matched controls. PLMS were found to be very common during pregnancy; 45% of women had a PLMS index > 5 and 25% had a PLMS index > 15. The number of PLMS per hour did not differ by hypertensive status. Sleep quality was mostly unaffected by PLMS, as was change in blood pressure overnight. While RLS was reported by 18.3% of the sample, this did not reliably predict the presence of PLMS. Despite iron deficiency being common in this population, it was not associated with PLMS. This novel study investigating the frequency and impact of PLMS during pregnancy revealed that PLMS are very common in the third trimester; however, this disorder appears to be benign in terms of objective sleep quality and relationship with pregnancy-related hypertension.

N2  - This study examined the course of antidepressant use, sleep quality, and depression severity from pregnancy through 6-month postpartum in women with and without a depressive disorder during pregnancy. Women (N = 215) were interviewed during pregnancy, 1- and 6-month postpartum. Mixed linear models were used to examine the longitudinal course and inter-relationships for the time-varying variables of antidepressant use, subjective sleep quality, and depression severity. Pregnant women with a depressive disorder who did not use antidepressants had more variable depression severity over time with improvements in depression severity by 6-month postpartum. In contrast, the depression severity of their medicated counterparts remained stable and high throughout. Pregnant women without a depressive disorder had worse sleep quality when using antidepressants compared with when they were not. Antidepressant use significantly strengthened the magnitude of the effect of sleep quality on depression severity in women with a depressive disorder during pregnancy. When prenatally depressed women use antidepressants, their sleep disturbance is more highly linked to depression severity than when they do not. Furthermore, antidepressants are not adequately treating the sleep disturbance of these women or their remitted counterparts, leaving both groups vulnerable to significant negative mental and physical health outcomes.

N2  - The consequences of childhood maltreatment are profound and long lasting. Not only does the victim of abuse suffer as a child, but there is mounting evidence that a history of maltreatment places the next generation at risk for significant psychopathology. Research identifies postnatal factors as affecting this intergenerational transmission of trauma. However, emerging evidence suggests that part of this risk may be transmitted before birth, passed on via abuse-related alterations in the in utero environment that are as yet largely unidentified. To date, no study has directly assessed the influence of pregnant women's abuse history on fetal neurobehavioral development, nor considered trauma-associated poor sleep quality as a mediator reflecting established physiological dysregulation. Using data from 262 pregnant adolescents (ages 14–19), a population at elevated risk for childhood maltreatment, the current study examined maternal emotional abuse history and sleep quality in relation to third-trimester fetal resting heart rate variability, an index of parasympathetic nervous system functioning. The results indicate that maternal emotional abuse history is indirectly associated with lower fetal heart rate variability via abuse-related sleep disturbances. These data demonstrate an association between maternal abuse histories and fetal development, showing that at least part of the intergenerational transmission of risk occurs during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Few studies have addressed obesity prevention among low-income families whose infants are at increased obesity risk. We tested a Facebook peer-group intervention for low-income mothers to foster behaviors promoting healthy infant growth. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 87 pregnant women (Medicaid insured, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) were randomized to the Grow2Gether intervention or text message appointment reminders. Grow2Gether participants joined a private Facebook group of 9–13 women from 2 months before delivery until infant age 9 months. A psychologist facilitated groups featuring a curriculum of weekly videos addressing feeding, sleep, parenting, and maternal well-being. Feasibility was assessed using the frequency and content of participation, and acceptability using surveys. Maternal beliefs and behaviors and infant growth were assessed at birth, 2, 4, 6, and 9 months. Differences in infant growth between study arms were explored. We conducted intention-to-treat analyses using quasi-least-squares regression. Results: Eighty-eight percent (75/85) of intervention participants (42% (36/85) food insecure, 88% (75/85) black) reported the group was helpful. Participants posted 30 times/group/week on average. At 9 months, the intervention group had significant improvement in feeding behaviors (Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire) compared to the control group (p = 0.01, effect size = 0.45). Intervention group mothers were significantly less likely to pressure infants to finish food and, at age 6 months, give cereal in the bottle. Differences were not observed for other outcomes, including maternal feeding beliefs or infant weight-for-length. Conclusions: A social media peer-group intervention was engaging and significantly impacted certain feeding behaviors in families with infants at high risk of obesity.

N2  - Increasing evidence suggests a role for inflammation in neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous work in rodents has established that immune activation during critical developmental periods can cause phenotypes that reproduce core features of ASD, including decreased social interaction, aberrant communication, and increased repetitive behavior. In humans, ASD is frequently associated with comorbid medical conditions including sleep disorders, motor hyperactivity, and seizures. Here we use a ‘two-hit’ immune-activation paradigm to determine whether perinatal immune activation can also produce these comorbid features in mice. In this paradigm, we treated timed-pregnant mice with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), which simulates a viral infection, on gestational day 12.5 according to an established maternal immune activation regimen. A subset of the offspring also received a second ‘hit’ of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which simulates a bacterial infection, on postnatal day 9. At 6 weeks of age, mice were implanted with wireless telemetry transmitters that enabled continuous measurements of electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), locomotor activity, and subcutaneous temperature. Effects at 7 and 12 weeks of age were compared. Both prenatal Poly I:C and postnatal LPS produced changes in locomotor activity and temperature patterns, increases in slow-wave sleep, and shifts in EEG spectral power, several of which persisted at 12 weeks of age. Postnatal LPS also produced persistent increases in spontaneous bursts of epileptiform activity (spike-wave discharges) that occurred predominantly during sleep. Our findings demonstrate that early-life immune activation can lead to long-lasting physiologic perturbations that resemble medical comorbidities often seen in ASD and other neuropsychiatric conditions.

N2  - Objectives Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been linked with ill-health in adulthood, but ACE literature has focused on family disruption or dysfunction (e.g., child abuse, parental separation), with less attention to economic adversity. We examined whether a mother’s economic hardship in childhood (EHC) was associated with women’s hardships and health-risk behaviors during/just before pregnancy. Methods We analyzed population-based survey data on 27,102 postpartum California women. EHC included respondents’ reports that during childhood they/their families experienced hunger because of inability to afford food or moved because of problems paying rent/mortgage and the frequency of difficulty paying for basic needs. We examined six maternal hardships/behaviors during/just before pregnancy, including four hardships (poverty, food insecurity, homelessness/no regular place to sleep, intimate partner violence) and two behaviors (smoking, binge drinking). Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated from sequential logistic regression models estimating associations between EHC (categorized by level of hardship) and each maternal hardship/behavior, first without adjustment, then adjusting for other childhood and current maternal factors, and finally adding family disruption/dysfunction. Results Before adjustment for family disruption/dysfunction, the highest and intermediate EHC levels were associated with each maternal hardship/behavior; after full adjustment, those associations persisted except with smoking. Higher EHC levels generally appeared associated with larger PRs, although confidence intervals overlapped. Conclusions for Policy/Practice These findings link childhood economic hardship with women’s hardships, binge drinking, and possibly smoking around the time of pregnancy. Without establishing causality, they support previous research indicating that childhood economic adversity should be considered an ACE. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Study Objectives: Zika virus infection during pregnancy may result in congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), whose characteristics are being described. Methods: The aim of the present study was to investigate the sleep characteristics of 136 infants and toddlers (88 with CZS and 48 with typical development [TD], age and gender matched, 60% girls and 40% boys in both groups) using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. The ages of children in both groups ranged from 5 to 24 months (CZS 15.9 ± 0.4 vs. TD 15.8 ± 1.0 months, p = 0.90). Results: The results show that 34.1% of CZS and 2% of TD children were defined as poor sleepers, 15% of CZS and 2% of TD children remained awake at night for a period longer than 1 hr, and 24% of CZS and 2% of TD children slept less than 9 hr. The CZS group showed shorter total sleep time (CZS 11.24 ± 2.6 vs. TD 12.02 ± 1.9 hr, p = 0.03) and shorter nocturnal sleep duration than the TD group (CZS 8.2 ± 0.2 vs. TD 9.4 ± 0.2 hr, p = 0.0002). In contrast to the control group (p = 0.02, r = −0.34), in the CZS group, no correlation was found between age and nocturnal wakefulness. Future studies should explore these data in relation to the development and maturation of the central nervous system of these children. Conclusions: Considering the well-known consequences of poor sleep quality on health in several populations, the presence of sleep disorders should be considered in CZS using multidisciplinary treatments.

N2  - Distress and sleep are associated across the lifespan, often overlapping in symptoms and exacerbating each other. Both distress and sleep disruptions are elevated during pregnancy and increasing evidence points to associated adverse maternal, birth, fetal, and infant outcomes. Fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) and attachment are two different markers of later child functioning, one physiological, and one relational. Although some studies have examined parts of this puzzle, this is the first study to examine the relationships among distress, sleep, FHRV, and attachment specifically in multicultural, urban, pregnant adolescents, who are at increased risk of distress and sleep disruptions. Participants (N = 298) were recruited through a large urban hospital and were assessed at three time points during their pregnancy, and once with their infants, 14 months after birth. Results support a replication in the association between prenatal sleep and distress in an adolescent sample, as well as indicating that distress predicts poor sleep, contrary to what was expected based on results from adult samples. Findings indicate that sleep disturbances and distress in the first trimester are associated with lower FHRV in the third trimester. Additionally, and while results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size, findings suggest that attachment in adolescent mother-infant dyads may not relate to prenatal variables in the ways expected based on adult samples. Further research is recommended to better understand how pre- and postnatal psychological and physiological variables interact in adolescents, who are navigating pregnancy and the transition to motherhood at a unique point in their own development.

N2  - A client named Elizabeth, a pseudonym, was referred for services in 2011 through her organisation’s Human Resources department in their efforts to address the client’s reaction to what the organization perceived to be to a single ‘incident’ of bullying against the client that had occurred in 2007. Elizabeth’s employer was a significant business, with a large workforce. The ‘incident’ referred to by the employer occurred four years before when a senior male colleague had sent an email that was intended to be highly offensive to and critical of Elizabeth and damaging to her professional career to over 100 people within her employment and professional circle. To implement the intervention, the initial focus was on the individual before shifting to the relationship between her and her workplace. 1 Stabilization of Elizabeth Elizabeth was the single mother and sole carer of a 6-year-old child as her husband and child's father had died while Elizabeth was pregnant. She had little support from family members. Elizabeth was the family's only breadwinner. She did not smoke, use alcohol, or other prescribed drugs. Elizabeth was strongly affiliated to a church. She had strong social connections outside her employment, almost all church related. The DASS 42 was used as a measure of Elizabeth's depression, anxiety, and stress. The depression scores were in the mild range and were not of particular concern. Initially Elizabeth's anxiety and stress scores were in the extremely severe range. Initial sessions were focused on assisting Elizabeth to sleep and eat better and to be more fully present when she was with her child. Being an otherwise highly functional individual with a good support structure, she was encouraged to engage in those aspects of her life that gave her pleasure and non-work meaning. Once her anxiety and stress had reduced somewhat, it was possible to focus more on what had occurred within the workplace, to help her gain perspective and plan a response. 2 Building a clear understanding of the conflict escalation The specific problem identified was that prior to and subsequent to the 'incident' Elizabeth had been the victim of at least four years of systematic, repeated and pervasive harassment, belittling, and other behaviours perpetrated by the same pair of individuals within her workplace in a manner that would be reasonably considered to be bullying. However, her employer appeared to not understand this fact and Elizabeth had been treated as if each incident were separate isolated events, without there being any understanding of the cumulative impact of years of workplace bullying. Consequently all the organisation's attempts to fix the problem as they saw it failed because the organization failed to see, or were not interested in seeing, the systematic, repeated, and pervasive nature of the bullying. Through a detailed examination of all the various events that had occurred over several years it became very clear that this was a repeated pattern of behaviour targeted at Elizabeth, to which the organisation had either failed to respond, or responded only in part having failed to complete a performance management process with the main offending colleagues, which was construed by Elizabeth as the organisation letting them get away with bullying (her)".

N2  - Preterm birth (PTB) occurs among 1:11U.S. white women and 1:7.5 African American women and is a significant driver of racial disparities in infant mortality. Maternal stress is the most common clinical phenotype underlying spontaneous PTB. Specific patterns of stress and biological mediators driving PTB remain unclear. We examined the effect of childhood stress on birth timing among African American women and evaluated maternal cortisol elevation as a biological mediator. A prospective observational design was employed, with a single study visit at 28–32 weeks gestation and medical record review. The Stress and Adversity Inventory was administered, which provides a comprehensive estimate of childhood stress, stress in adulthood, and five core characteristic subscales (interpersonal loss, physical danger, humiliation, entrapment, role disruption). Venipuncture was performed between 11:00am and 4:00pm and plasma cortisol quantified by ELISA. Analyses controlled for stress in adulthood. Among a final sample of 89, cumulative childhood stress predicted birth timing (p = 0.01). The association was driven by stress related to interpersonal loss and physical danger, with support for maternal cortisol as a biological mediator (ab = 0.02, 95% CI [0.001, 0.045]; ab = 0.02, 95% CI [0.001, 0.043], respectively). Results were similar, overall, in sub-group analyses among spontaneously laboring women (n = 53); however, role disruption arose as an additional predictor, as mediated by cortisol elevations (ab = 0.03, 95% CI [0.005, 0.074]). Of note, cortisol was no longer supported as a mediator linking physical danger to birth timing after adjusting for sleep quality and hours awake prior to venipuncture (ab = 0.02, 95% CI [−0.0001, 0.046]). We provide preliminary evidence that, independent of stress in adulthood, childhood stress of specific core characteristics may shape birth timing, with cortisol elevation as a biological mediator. Further investigation is warranted and may bolster the development of biologically-informed screening tools for the prediction and targeted prevention of stress-related PTB.

N2  - Objective: Research has demonstrated that exposure to violence and adversity has negative effects on both mental health and biobehavioral outcomes, such as sleep health. Research examining the relationship between past and recent violence exposure and mental health suggests that the effects of childhood adversity are especially pernicious, but to date, no studies have attempted to disentangle the direct, indirect and relative effects of past year versus childhood exposure to violence and adversity on sleep. The objective of the current study was to examine the direct effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and past year intimate partner violence (IPV) on different aspects of sleep health in pregnant women. Method: A sample of high-risk pregnant women (n = 101) were interviewed. Mediation analysis with bias-corrected, bootstrapped confidence intervals was used to evaluate direct and indirect effects. Results: Findings indicated that while ACEs had significant direct effects on mental health, past year IPV had stronger effects on sleep quality, latency, and efficiency. ACEs did, however, indirectly affect subjective sleep quality via past year psychological IPV. Conclusion: These findings suggest that sleep disturbance may be a regulatory stress response that is most clearly linked to past year violence and trauma. That is, though long-term sleep disturbance may be evident following childhood adversity, it is likely that this relationship is better explained by the role of childhood adversity in predicting adulthood revictimization or due to long-term mental health difficulties associated with early trauma.

N2  - Objective: Given the significance of sleep quality among pregnant women and its effects on the health of the fetus and the lack of sufficient studies in this field as well, the present study aimed to both identify some of the psychological factors associated with sleep quality among pregnant women and investigate the relationship between sleep quality among pregnant women and other variables, including depression, anxiety, stress, resilience, perceived social support, and marital adjustment. Materials and methods: In this descriptive-correlational study, 425 pregnant women, visiting Islamabad and Ravansar–based prenatal care centers (randomly selected from the townships of Kermanshah Province (Iran)) in 2015, were selected. To collect the required data, the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test (LWSMAT), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RIS), Zimet’s Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and depression, anxiety and stress scales were used. Results: The results of data analysis demonstrated that there was a significant relationship between the quality of sleep and variables like depression, anxiety, stress, perception, social support and marital adjustment. Further, the results showed that the hierarchical regression of all variables could predict 31% of the changes of sleep quality. Additionally, anxiety, depression and stress were ranked first, second and third in terms of the shares of variables in predicting the quality of sleep. Whereas, resilience, perceived social support and marital adjustment were unable to predict the quality of sleep. Conclusion: Given the results of the present study, it is suggested that the roles of the psychological factors be considered in improving the quality of sleep among pregnant women.

N2  - Objective: Sleep complaints are clinically expected in children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. We aim to reveal patterns of association among sleep–wake behaviors that are challenging in the life of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Through text-mining analyses, we numericized the transcripts of 59 caregiver’s informal, conversational interviews. That is, the relative frequencies-of-occurrences of words as well as their semantic specificities (italic) were clustered, categorized, and visualized for patterns. Results: A total of 4008 words were indexed where sleep took the 91st place of most important words. Sleep and wake were however not associatively conversed throughout the interviews. Sleep-related words conversed were: night, nap, apnea, asleep, awake, bed, bedroom, bedtime, mattress, melatonin, overnight, and wake-up. Among some FASD-characteristic words describing the challenges were: huge, alcohol, manage*, stop, adopt, crazy*. The semantic space reflecting these challenges experienced in caring for children with FASD was divided into two axes: child-oriented vs. other-oriented words, and day-related and night-related words. The position of sleep shows that problematic sleep was expressed as a ‘family’ issue. Clumsy* was interrelated with problematic sleeping and waking. Despite that mostly night was associatively conversed, the association of Routines, Managing, and Planning with sleep underscores the challenges faced. Conclusion: When conversing caregivers of children with FASD seldom interrelate ‘sleep’ but rather ‘night’ with FASD-characteristics. Increased sleep awareness combined with educational initiatives regarding sleep are advocated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction: Maternal use of smoked tobacco during pregnancy causes significant morbidity and mortality in the human infant including alterations in autonomic control with increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome. We hypothesized that maternal snus (smokeless tobacco) use during pregnancy affects autonomic cardiac regulation in the infant, as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) and the low frequency and high frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio). Methods: A prospective observational study of 56 infants of women who used snus (n = 23) or cigarettes (n = 13) during pregnancy versus tobacco- and nicotine-free controls (n = 19). The nicotine dose was estimated by questionnaires at 4 timepoints pre- and post-natally. The infants’ urine cotinine concentration and HRV during 2 hours of sleep were studied 1–2 months after birth. Results: LF/HF ratio was higher in snus (mean 3.31; 95% CI 2.78–3.83) and smoke (3.51;2.54–4.47) compared to controls (2.15; 1.76–2.54, p = .002). Early prenatal nicotine exposure “without” any further exposure increased the LF/HF ratio (3.19; 2.55–3.84, p = .02). Continuous prenatal nicotine exposure “without” postnatal exposure was also associated with a residual increase in LF/HF ratio (4.40; 3.38–5.42, p < .001). There was no difference between infants exposed to smokeless versus smoked tobacco, suggesting a common constituent (nicotine) altering autonomic cardiac regulation. Conclusion: Infants to mothers who used snus during pregnancy showed lower vagal activity with an increased LF/HF ratio compared to controls, and similar to infants of smokers. Even early prenatal exposure to snus has a lasting impact on autonomic cardiac regulation suggesting a fetal “re-programing” of the developing autonomic nervous system. Implications: The results indicate that smokeless tobacco (Swedish snus) affects the developing autonomic nervous system during gestation. Even if exposure is interrupted during the first or second trimester, effects in autonomic cardiac regulation are seen in the 1–2 month-old infant. This underlines the importance of abstaining from all types of tobacco use during the whole pregnancy. Our findings may also have more general relevance to other routes by which nicotine can be delivered to a fetus and newborn. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Anxiety about labor in women at the end of pregnancy sometimes reaches levels that are clinically concerning. We investigated whether low-risk pregnant women with childbirth fear during the last trimester demonstrate specific findings with regard to resting heart rate variability (HRV) and examined whether HRV biofeedback can reduce this fear and alter resting HRV. We measured the levels of childbirth fear (Wijma delivery expectancy/experience questionnaire, W-DEQ) and resting HRV indexes in 97 low-risk pregnant women in their 32nd–34th week of gestation and advised women with W-DEQ scores of ≥ 66 (n = 40) to practice HRV biofeedback (StressEraser) at home. We then reassessed these measures 3–4 weeks later in the 36th–37th week of gestation regardless of whether the women practiced the method. We found that childbirth fear had no significant effect on resting HRV indexes when the W-DEQ cutoff was conventionally set at ≥ 66. However, women with W-DEQ scores of ≥ 90 (n = 5) had a significantly lower high-frequency power than their counterparts (p = 0.028). The W-DEQ scores reduced significantly in women who performed HRV biofeedback (n = 18, p < 0.001), but there was no change in those who did not perform the method (n = 20). These findings suggested that very high W-DEQ scores (≥ 90), but not the conventional criteria (W-DEQ score ≥ 66), of the fear of childbirth were associated with low parasympathetic activity among low-risk pregnant women and that HRV biofeedback intervention can effectively decrease the fear of childbirth in these women.

N2  - Objectives: To examine oxidative & nitrosative stress (O & NS) biomarkers at the end of term in relation to perinatal affective symptoms, neuro-immune biomarkers and pregnancy-related outcome variables. Methods: We measured plasma advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), total radical trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), -sulfhydryl (-SH), peroxides (LOOH) and paraoxonase (PON)1 activity in pregnant women with and without prenatal depression and non-pregnant controls. Results: Pregnancy is accompanied by significantly increased AOPP and NOx, and lowered TRAP, -SH and LOOH. Increased O&NS and lowered LOOH and -SH levels are associated with prenatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms (fatigue, pain, dyspepsia, gastro-intestinal symptoms). Increased AOPP and NOx are significantly associated with lowered –SH, TRAP and zinc, and with increased haptoglobin and C-reactive protein levels. Increased O&NS and lowered TRAP and PON 1 activity, at the end of term predict mother (e.g. hyperpigmentation, labor duration, caesarian section, cord length, breast milk flow) and baby (e.g. sleep and feeding problems) outcome characteristics. Conclusions: Pregnancy is accompanied by interrelated signs of O&NS, lowered antioxidant defenses and activated neuro-immune pathways. Increased O&NS at the end of term is associated with perinatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms and may predict obstetric and behavioral complications in mother and baby.

N2  - Evidence suggests that all humans experience nightmares, and most experience them regularly throughout their life. Most recently, Antti Revonsuo, a neuroscientist, developed the threat simulation theory that views nightmares as a kind of biological fire drill that ensures that our bodies are always on alert for dangers that may present themselves throughout the night when we are sleeping. Dreaming begins to take place sometime around the middle of the second trimester of pregnancy and is understood to contribute to the rapid progression of complex neural development that readies the fetus for survival and life outside of the womb. Newborns and infants spend far more time in REM sleep than at any other age. Sleep researchers agree that REM is strongly linked to establishing neural pathways in the brain and body. The following presents a smorgasbord of play therapy practices that I have discovered and developed through many sources and that can be used with children experiencing nightmares. These practices can be tweaked for considerations involving the child’s age, stage, and specific contextual considerations. Comments about some examples of these will be offered in the descriptions.
