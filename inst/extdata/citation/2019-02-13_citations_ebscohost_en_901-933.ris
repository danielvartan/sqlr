AB  - Objective: Sleep during pregnancy involves a physiological challenge to provide sufficient gas exchange to the fetus. Enhanced ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia may protect from deficient gas exchange, but sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) may predispose to adverse events. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep and breathing in healthy pregnant women compared to non-pregnant controls, with a focus on CO2 changes and upper-airway flow limitation.Methods: Healthy women in the third trimester and healthy non-pregnant women with normal body mass index (BMI) were recruited for polysomnography. Conventional analysis of sleep and breathing was performed. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO2) was determined for each sleep stage. Flow-limitation was analyzed using the flattening index and TcCO2 values were recorded for every inspiration.Results: Eighteen pregnant women and 12 controls were studied. Pregnancy was associated with shorter sleep duration and more superficial sleep. Apnea-hypopnea index, arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation, flow-limitation, snoring or periodic leg movements were similar in the two groups. Mean SaO2 and minimum SaO2 were lower and average heart rate was higher in the pregnant group. TcCO2 levels did not differ between groups but variance of TcCO2 was smaller in pregnant women during non-rapid eye movement (NREM). TcCO2 profiles showed transient TcCO2 peaks, which seem specific to pregnancy.Conclusions: Healthy pregnancy does not predispose to SDB. Enhanced ventilatory control manifests as narrowing threshold of TcCO2 between wakefulness and sleep. Pregnant women have a tendency for rapid CO2 increases during sleep which might have harmful consequences if not properly compensated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a support binder for low back pain in pregnancy. DESIGN: Pilot study, using a prospective, two-group design with repeated measures. SETTING: Ambulatory maternity clinic in a tertiary care teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Women of at least 20 weeks gestation with low back pain, but no preexisting back or disc disease. Thirty women assigned to the intervention group and 10 to a comparison group. INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed a pain assessment at pretest. Intervention participants received a maternity support binder to wear while awake for 2 weeks. At an appointment 2 weeks later, a posttest questionnaire and a taped interview were administered. The comparison group participants received the support binder after the second appointment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Back pain intensity, duration, and effect on daily activities were assessed using a pain in pregnancy questionnaire. RESULTS: The intervention group had significant reduction in mean pain scores and effect of pain on daily activities, including family, house and yard, recreational, exercise, and sleep. Interaction of group by time was significant for change in pain and effect on family, house and yard, and exercise activities. CONCLUSION: The use of a support binder for pregnancy-related low back pain is a promising intervention and was well-accepted by the participants.

AB  - ObjectivesJuvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy(J.M.E.) needs life-long anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment. Of various drugs tried in this condition, valproate effectively treats all types of seizures seen in J.M.E. Among valproate side effects, neural tube defects (NTD) in the offspring, is a deterring factor in its use in childbearing period. To avoid NTD, most authorities advise on switching to AED drug before conception.As well, the effects of valproate on male fertility is feared of. Clonazepam controls only the myoclonic jerks, leaving the patients unprotected and susceptible to generalized seizures, which mostly occur in the morning after sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is the most prevalent precipitating factor for generalized seizures in these patients.Materials &MethodsBetween Jan 2003 & April 2008, 15 newly diagnosed JME patients (9 girls, 6 boys), were given clonazepam (1.0-4.0 mg) at bedtime, and were compared to 16 patients on valproate treatment. All were advised to avoid sleep deprivation.ResultsThis study showed, all patients in the clonazepam group, (100%) had full control of their myoclonic jerks; 4(26.6%) had breakthrough episodes of generalized seizures, provoked by sleep deprivation; the rest (11,73.4%), were in full remission of their myoclonic and generalized seizures. In control group, 2(12.5%), had episodes of breakthrough, sleep-deprived, generalized seizures;the rest(14, 87.5%) were in remission. Statistically, there was no significance between the results in both groups. Clonazepam side effects were limited to mild to moderate drowsiness in the morning, eliminated by giving the dose earlier at night.ConclusionThe study suggests that if J.M.E. patients avoid sleep deprivation, they can be treated with clonazepam alone to avoid side effects of valproate

AB  - Ayurveda is a comprehensive natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000 years ago. It is still widely used in India as a system of primary health care, and interest in it is growing worldwide as well. Ayurveda has unique concepts and methodologies to address health care throughout the course of life, from pregnancy and infant care to geriatric disorders. Common spices are utilized, as well as herbs, herbal mixtures, and special preparations known as Rasayanas. Purification procedures known as Panchakarma remove toxins from the physiology. Research has been conducted worldwide on Ayurveda. There are encouraging results for its effectiveness in treating various ailments, including chronic disorders associated with the aging process. Pilot studies presented in this paper were conducted on depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. These preliminary studies yielded positive results and provide a basis for conducting larger, more rigorous clinical trials. Conducting research that compares Ayurveda's comprehensive treatment approach, Western allopathic treatment, and an integrated approach combining the Ayurvedic and allopathic treatments would shed light on which treatment approach is the most effective for the benefit of the patient.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of using the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES) Unicorder for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women. METHODS: Sixteen pregnant women, mean age (SD) = 29.8 (5.4) years, average gestational age (SD) = 28.6 (6.3) weeks, mean body mass index (SD) = 44.7 (6.9) kg/m(2) with signs and symptoms of OSA wore the ARES Unicorder during one night of laboratory polysomnography (PSG). PSG was scored according to AASM 2007 criteria, and PSG AHI and RDI were compared to the ARES 1%, 3%, and 4% AHIs calculated with the ARES propriety software. RESULTS: Median PSG AHI and PSG RDI were 3.1 and 10.3 events/h of sleep, respectively. Six women had a PSG AHI >= 5 events/h of sleep and 11 had a PSG RDI >= 5 events/h of sleep. PSG AHI and RDI were strongly correlated with the ARES AHI measures. When compared with polysomnographic diagnosis of OSA, the ARES 3% algorithm provided the best balance between sensitivity (1.0 for PSG AHI, 0.91 for PSG RDI) and specificity (0.5 for PSG AHI, 0.8 for PSG RDI) for detecting sleep disordered breathing in our sample. CONCLUSIONS: The ARES Unicorder demonstrated reasonable consistency with PSG for diagnosing OSA in this small, heterogeneous sample of obese pregnant women.

AB  - We evaluated the psychometric properties of a Mandarin Chinese version of the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire‐10 (FOSQ‐10) in pregnant women. A total of 228 first‐trimester pregnant women participated in the study, which was conducted in an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. The Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = .85), adequate corrected item‐total correlations (from.40 to.67), and acceptable test–retest reliability over 7 days (ICC = .73). Construct validity was supported by exploratory factor analysis showing a one‐factor structure with item loadings between.49 and.77. Significant associations with the Medical Outcomes Study Short‐Form Health Survey 12 version 2 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index supported criterion‐related and convergent validity. Significant differences in the Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 total scores were found between women with clinically significant daytime sleepiness and those without, suggesting adequate discriminant validity. Ceiling effects were observed for all items, but no floor or ceiling effects were found for total scores. Findings suggest that the Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 is a valid and reliable instrument to identify important effects of sleep‐related impairment in Chinese women during pregnancy. Further testing is needed in more diverse pregnant women, such as women with complicated pregnancies and those with sleep disorders. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationships between key variables obtained from ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) and the wrist-worn Watch-PAT 200 device in pregnant women. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, women in their third trimester of pregnancy underwent full overnight home PSG using the 22-channel MediPalm system and the Watch-PAT 200 device. PSGs were scored by a blinded, experienced technologist using AASM 2007 criteria; the Watch-PAT was scored automatically by the manufacturer's proprietary software. RESULTS: A total of 31 pregnant women were studied. Mean age was 30.2 ± 7.1 years; mean gestational age was 33.4 ± 3.0 weeks; mean BMI was 31.9 ± 8.1 kg/m(2); 39% of women were nulliparous. Key variables generated by PSG and Watch-PAT correlated well over a wide range, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, r = 0.76, p < 0.001); respiratory disturbance index (RDI, r = 0.68, p < 0.001), mean oxygen saturation (r = 0.94, p < 0.001), and minimum oxygen saturation (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). The area under the curve for AHI >= 5 and RDI >= 10 were 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. Association between stage 3 sleep on PSG and deep sleep on Watch-PAT was poor. Watch-PAT tended to overscore RDI, particularly as severity increased. CONCLUSIONS: Among pregnant women, Watch-PAT demonstrates excellent sensitivity and specificity for identification of obstructive sleep apnea, defined as AHI >= 5 on full PSG. Watch-PAT may overestimate RDI somewhat, especially at high RDI values.

AB  - Somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, appetite changes, and sleep disruption) are common to both pregnancy and depression. The goal of the present study was to examine the validity of somatic symptoms as indicators of depression during pregnancy. The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) was administered to a cross-sectional sample of 255 pregnant women as well as 820 women from five community-based samples, who served as a control group. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the fit of a single-factor model of depression in pregnant and community samples. Multigroup CFA was used to test the invariance of the factor loadings of eight depression-related symptom scales. The fit for a one-factor model was adequate for both the pregnant and community samples. All eight IDAS scales were valuable indicators of depression in the community group; however, Appetite Loss and Appetite Gain were poor indicators of depression among the pregnant women. The factor loadings for Lassitude and Appetite Gain were significantly weaker amongst the pregnant women than community women. The magnitude of the factor loadings for Insomnia and Well Being were significantly greater for the pregnant group. With the exception of appetite disturbance, somatic symptoms, though a common occurrence during pregnancy, are valid indicators of depression during pregnancy. When assessing for prenatal depression, somatic symptoms should not necessarily be dismissed as normative pregnancy experiences.

AB  - We report a term male baby, born by normal pregnancy and uneventful Cesarean delivery, who experienced central apneas during sleep. He was diagnosed with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (Ondine curse) by means of polysomnographic registration--contemporarily using a thermistor, a strain gauge, and pulse oximetry. The diagnosis was further confirmed by genetic investigation for PHOX2B mutations. Serial EEGs during the first days of life showed negative and biphasic vertex Rolandic spikes (Figure).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether very low birth weight (<1500 g) is associated with the risk of sleep-disordered breathing in young adulthood. METHODS: The study was a retrospective longitudinal study of 158 young adults born with very low birth weight and 169 term-born control subjects (aged 18.5-27.1 years). The principal outcome variable was sleep-disordered breathing defined as chronic snoring. RESULTS: The crude prevalence of chronic snoring was similar in both groups: 15.8% for the very low birth weight group versus 13.6% for the control group. However, after controlling for the confounding variables in multivariate logistic regression models (age, gender, current smoking, parental education, height, BMI, and depression), chronic snoring was 2.2 times more likely in the very low birth weight group compared with the control group. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy was significantly and independently of very low birth weight related to risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Maternal preeclampsia, standardized birth weight, and, for very low birth weight infants, small-for-gestational-age status were not related to sleep-disordered breathing. CONCLUSIONS: Premature infants with very low birth weight have a twofold risk of sleep-disordered breathing as young adults. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of sleep-disordered breathing by more than twofold.

AB  - OBJETIVE: To determine whether full-term newborn infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) present immature/disorganised EEG patterns in the immediate neonatal period, and whether there was any relationship with maternal glycaemic control. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cohort study with an incidental sample performed in a tertiary hospital neonatal unit. PATIENTS: 23 IDM and 22 healthy newborns born between 2010 and 2013. INTERVENTIONS: All underwent video-EEG recording lasting >90 min at 48-72 h of life. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We analysed the percentage of indeterminate sleep, transient sharp waves per hour and mature-for-gestational age EEG patterns (discontinuity, maximum duration of interburst interval (IBI), asynchrony, asymmetry, [delta] brushes, encoches frontales and [alpha]/ rolandic activity). The group of IDM was divided into two subgroups according to maternal HbA1c: (1) HbA1c>=6% and (2) HbA1c<6%. RESULTS: Compared with healthy newborns, IDM presented significantly higher percentage of indeterminate sleep (57% vs 25%; p<0.001), discontinuity (2.5% vs 0%; p=0.044) and [delta] brushes in the bursts (6% vs 3%; p=0.024); higher duration of IBI (0.3 s vs 0 s; p=0.017); fewer encoches frontales (7/h vs 35/h; p<0.001), reduced /[alpha] rolandic activity (3/h vs 9/h; p<0.001); and more transient sharp waves (25/h vs 5/h; p<0.001). IDM with maternal HbA1c>=6% showed greater percentage of [delta] brushes in the burst (14% vs 4%; p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Full-term IDM newborns showed video-EEG features of abnormal development of brain function. Maternal HbA1c levels<6% during pregnancy could minimise the risk of cerebral dysmaturity.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aims of this longitudinal study were to examine (a) development of infant sleep and maternal sleep from 3 to 6 months postpartum; (b) concomitant and prospective links between maternal sleep and infant sleep; and (c) triadic links between paternal involvement in infant caregiving and maternal and infant sleep. The study included 57 families that were recruited during pregnancy. Maternal and infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries for 5 nights. Both fathers and mothers completed a questionnaire assessing the involvement of fathers relative to mothers in infant caregiving. The results demonstrated moderate improvement in infant and maternal sleep percent between 3 and 6 months. Maternal sleep percent at 3 months significantly predicted infant sleep percent at 6 months. Greater paternal involvement in infant daytime and nighttime caregiving at 3 months significantly predicted more consolidated maternal and infant sleep at 6 months. These findings suggest that maternal sleep is an important predictor of infant sleep and that increased involvement of fathers in infant caregiving responsibilities may contribute to improvements in both maternal and infant sleep during the first 6 months postpartum.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare an indigenous sleep device (wahakura] for infants at high risk for sudden unexpected death with a bassinet, for measures of infant sleep position, head covering, breastfeeding, bed-sharing, and maternal sleep and fatigue. METHODS: A total of 200 mainly Māori pregnant women were recruited from deprived areas of New Zealand. They were randomized to receive a bassinet or wahakura and asked to sleep the infant in this device from birth. Questionnaires at 1, 3, and 6 months and an overnight infrared video in the home at 1 month were completed. RESULTS: An intention-to-treat and an "as-used" analysis of questionnaires showed no group differences at 1, 3, and 6 months in infant-adult direct bed-sharing (7% vs 12%, P = .24 at 1 month), and at the 6-month interview, the wahakura group reported twice the level of full breastfeeding (22.5% vs 10.7%, P = .04). Maternal sleep and fatigue were not significantly different between groups. Video identified no increase in head covering, prone/side sleep position, or bed-sharing in the wahakura group, either from intention-to-treat analysis, or when analyzed for actual sleep location. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in infant risk behaviors in wahakura compared with bassinets and there were other advantages, including an increase in sustained breastfeeding. This suggests wahakura are relatively safe and can be promoted as an alternative to infant-adult bed-sharing. Policies that encourage utilization are likely to be helpful in high-risk populations.

AB  - Oncofertility is one of the 9 NIH Roadmap Initiatives, federal grants intended to explore previously intractable questions, and it describes a new field that exists in the liminal space between cancer treatment and its sequelae, IVF clinics and their yearning, and basic research in cell growth, biomaterials, and reproductive science and its tempting promises. Cancer diagnoses, which were once thought universally fatal, now often entail management of a chronic disease. Yet the therapies are rigorous, must start immediately, and in many cases result in premature failure of the body's reproductive ability. In women, this loss is especially poignant; unlike the routine storage of sperm, which is done in men and boys facing similar treatment decisions, freezing oocytes in anticipation of fertility loss is not possible in most cases, and creating an embryo within days of diagnosis raises significant moral, social and medical challenges. Oncofertility is the study of how to harvest ovarian tissue in women facing cancer to preserve their gametes for future use with IVF, thus allowing the decisions about childbearing to be deferred and reproductive choices to be preserved. The research endeavor uses the capacity of the ovarian follicle to produce eggs in vitro. Developing the human follicle to ovulate successfully outside the body is scientifically difficult and ethically challenging. Infertility is linked to long-standing religious and moral traditions, and is intertwined with deeply contentious social narratives about women, families, illness and birth. Is the research morally permissible? Perhaps imperative if understood as a repair from iatrogenic harms? How are considerations of justice central to the work? How will vulnerable subjects be protected? What are the moral implications of the work for women, children and families? What are the implications for society if women could store ovarian tissue as a way of stopping the biological clock? What are the moral possibilities and challenges if eggs can be produced in large quantities from a stored ovarian tissue?

AB  - Objective: to explore gestational weight gain in healthy women in relation to pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index, diet and physical activity. Design: a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 455 healthy pregnant women of all gestational ages receiving antenatal care from an independent midwife in the Netherlands. Weight gain was assessed using the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines and classified as below, within, or above the guidelines. A multinomial regression analysis was performed with weight gain classifications as the dependent variable (within IOM-guidelines as reference). Independent variables were pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index, diet (broken down into consumption of vegetables, fruit and fish) and physical activity (motivation to engage in physical activity, pre-pregnancy physical activity and decline in physical activity during pregnancy). Covariates were age, gestational age, parity, ethnicity, family income, education, perceived sleep deprivation, satisfaction with pre-pregnancy weight, estimated prepregnancy body mass index, smoking, having a weight gain goal and having received weight gain advice from the midwife. Findings: forty-two per cent of the women surveyed gained weight within the guidelines. Fourteen per cent of the women gained weight below the guidelines and 44 per cent gained weight above the guidelines. Weight gain within the guidelines, compared to both above and below the guidelines, was not associated with pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index nor with diet. A decline in physical activity was associated with weight gain above the guidelines (OR 0.54, 95 per cent CI 0.33-0.89). Weight gain below the guidelines was seen more often in women who perceived a greater sleep deprivation (OR 1.20, 95 per cent CI 1.02-1.41). Weight gain above the guidelines was seen less often in Caucasian women in comparison to non-Caucasian women (OR 0.22, 95 per cent CI 0.08-0.56) and with women who did not stop smoking during pregnancy (OR 0.49, 95 per cent CI 0.25-0.95). Key conclusions and implications for practice: a decline in physical activity was the only modifiable factor in our population associated with weight gain above the gain recommended by the guidelines. Prevention of reduced physical activity during pregnancy seems a promising approach to promoting healthy weight gain. Interventions to promote healthy weight gain should focus on all women, regardless of pre-pregnancy body mass index.

AB  - Trauma, primarily in the form of intimate partner violence and automobile accidents, accounts for 6-8% of all pregnancy complications. Much less is known about cumulative trauma (CT) exposure especially in African-American women. Women exposed to several types of trauma including childhood abuse, discrimination, or witnessed family violence may develop symptoms of posttraumatic stress or have difficulty sleeping.The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among cumulative trauma, posttraumatic stress, sleep, and perinatal outcomes. A sample of 150 essentially healthy African-American women who had given birth were recruited at Hutzel Women's Hospital and St. John Providence Hospital Southfield, and asked to complete the Cumulative Trauma Scale, Community Safety Questionnaire, Conflict Tactics Scale, Clinician-administered PTSD Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Edinburgh Depression Inventory, and Demographic Data Form. The prenatal and hospital medical records were reviewed for multiple maternal and neonatal outcomes. Regression analysis was used to determine if relationships between the variables exist, and the strength of those relationships.The findings of this study showed: 1) African- American women experience traumatic events. 2) cumulative trauma is associated with PTSD, depression, poor sleep quality, and neonatal outcomes; 3) nursing must go beyond the assessment of intimate partner violence, report active trauma, and record findings in the medical record; and 4) more research is needed to better understand mothers' use of over the counter and other medications to help them sleep. The relevance to maternal child health is that a better understanding of cumulative trauma exposure, PTSD, poor sleep, and the risk for poor perinatal outcomes among African-American women can lead to earlier identification and the development of nursing interventions.

AB  - This item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses. Purpose and Background/Significance: The main purpose of the study is to determine: (1) to determine if there is a relationship between vitamin D status, pregnancy symptoms, health promoting behaviors, and quality of life and (2) to determine if differences exist in pregnancy symptoms, health promoting behaviors and quality of life between African American and Hispanic women. There is evidence to show that vitamin D deficiency has been associated with numerous symptoms such as musculoskeletal pain, poor sleep, and depression. However, whether low levels of vitamin D is associated with these and other symptoms during pregnancy is unknown. What is known is that vitamin D deficiency disproportionately affects pregnant minority women, therefore, this study will help to understand the impact that vitamin D deficiency has on pregnancy symptoms and potential impact on quality of life. Theoretical/ conceptual framework: Using Wilson & Cleary's Health Related Quality of Life model, that the characteristics of the individual (e.g. age, ethnicity) and the environment (e.g. social support) has an important impact on biological factors (e.g. vitamin D status), symptom status (pregnancy symptoms and depression), functional status (health promoting behaviors), all of which ultimately effect the overall health related quality of life. Method: A descriptive, cross sectional design examining women at 24 to 32 weeks gestation. The variables of study include the following: biologic (vitamin D status), symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Pregnancy Symptom Inventory and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), functional status (Health Promoting Lifestyles Profilev.2), and quality of life (SF-12). A convenience sample of 125 women from an underserved, low income health center serving a predominantly African American and Hispanic patient population will be recruited. Results: With vitamin D measured on a binary scale as sufficient (vitamin D level >30 ng/ml) versus deficient (vitamin D level <30 ng/ml), both univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression models will be used to assess the association between these risk factors and vitamin D status. As a measure of effect size, univariable odds ratios along with their 95% confidence intervals will be reported, and a single multivariable model will report adjusted odds ratios for each factor after controlling for the influence of other significant predictors of vitamin D deficiency.

AB  - The occurrence of insomnia in women is influenced in great part by the complex hormonal cycles they undergo. Patterns of insomnia in younger women may be physiologically different on a hormonal basis from those found in older women. Although significant objective sleep disturbances have been difficult to demonstrate across the menstrual cycle in normal women, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) includes premenstrual insomnia and premenstrual hypersomnia as sleep disorders within the category of menstrual-associated sleep disorder. On the other hand, during pregnancy and after childbirth, profound fluctuations in steroid and hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis-related hormones produce significant physiological changes, including sleep disruption. During the menopausal transition, significant sleep disruptions are provoked by sleep-disordered breathing, vasomotor disturbance, and mood disorders. Regardless of age, women with chronic insomnia are at higher risk for developing or sustaining depression. Thoughtful management approaches must consider known relationships between menstrual or menopausal status and various sleep disorders, and should rely on pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, or a combination of treatments to achieve successful relief from insomnia. The off-label, first-line use of antidepressants for treating insomnia in the absence of depression is now considered debatable. The long-term efficacy and safety of the newer benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs) for insomnia, whether taken nightly or episodically, are supported by existing clinical experience. US Food and Drug Administration guide-lines limiting the use of hypnotics to only a few weeks predate the newer generation BZRAs, and, as such, the guidelines may no longer be truly appropriate for these new agents.

AB  - Naturally fluctuating hormones (menstrual cycle, through pregnancy or menopausal transition) are not related to marked sleep disturbances in women. It is likely, however, that subsets of women will display a central nervous system vulnerability to hormonal fluctuations so that sleep disturbances manifest as a part of a complex of discomforting symptoms. Sleep is impacted directly through the circadian system or brain sleep regulation or through the development of concurrent functional changes and symptoms. Women are susceptible to sleep-related disorders that are also common in men, such as primary insomnia and SBD although the contributing factors and manifestations may not be the same.

AB  - A woman's sleep is impacted by biology (menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause), sleep disorders (that may manifest differently than in men), and role in the home and workplace. A Women and Sleep Workshop, sponsored by the National Sleep Foundation, in March 2007 reviewed these topics. It was concluded that understanding the relationship between sleep and gender will result in a scientifically based approach to women's sleep problems.

AB  - Background: Women's sexual function can be dramatically affected during and after pregnancy. Aims: To explore Australian women's personal experience of changes in their sexual function during pregnancy and childbirth. Methods: This was an online qualitative survey in which women across Australia who had given birth in the previous 12 months were invited to take part. A total of 273 responses were included. Findings: The five main themes that emerged were: mental health changes; obstetric violence (including lack of support from caregivers, violation of privacy, instrumental delivery and episiotomy); relationship issues (including lack of support from partner, lack of intimacy and domestic violence); physical changes (including birth trauma and negative body image); and role conflict (including role incompatibility, breastfeeding and lack of sleep). Mental health changes were reported to have both positive and negative impacts on women's sexual function. Conclusions: Women experience many changes in their sexual function during and after pregnancy. Health professionals should take an integrated approach to improve women's sexual function and overall wellness.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the self-reported prevalence and impact of low back pain (LBP) during pregnancy in primiparous and multiparous women, and their treatment-seeking rationales and experiences, including their use of physiotherapy. METHODS: A sample of 105 post-partum women was recruited. All participants answered a questionnaire; women who experienced LBP during pregnancy (n=71) continue in the study and later they were also interviewed. Content analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Reports of LBP were common (n=71; 67.6%) and slightly more frequent in primiparous (n=40; 56.3%) than multiparous (n=31; 43.7%) women. Multiparous women with LBP were significantly older (p< 0.001) and reported more sleep disturbances (p=0.026) than primiparous women with LBP. LBP prevented women performing their daily activities (n=41; 57.7%) and worsened with the advance of pregnancy (n=55; 77.5%), yet 93.0% (n=66) of these women received no treatment. CONCLUSION: LBP is a prevalent and important clinical condition affecting the daily life of many pregnant women. Nevertheless, few women seek any treatment and physiotherapy is rarely considered. Given the significant impact on quality of life, health professionals need to be proactive in asking women about LBP.

AB  - Women's experiences during late pregnancy and the early postpartum period were examined relative to time of discharge from the hospital. Women who were discharged in 3 days or sooner were compared to women who were discharged after 3 days, with respect to fatigue. A rest and activity questionnaire was completed by the women in the third trimester of pregnancy, in postpartum Week 1, and in postpartum Week 4. Few differences were found with respect to hours slept, number of sleep interruptions, perceptions of tiredness, and impact of tiredness on daily life; tiredness was a major aspect of women's experience, regardless of how long they stayed in hospital. The information will help nurses preparing women for their late pregnancy and postpartum experiences and will ease the concern of those who believe women will be more tired if they leave hospital soon after birth.

AB  - The purpose of this review article is to evaluate the peripartum outcomes of yoga during pregnancy, including the postpartum period and lactation. The PubMed database was analyzed from January 1970 to January 2011. We identified five prospective observational studies (n = 575) and three randomized clinical trials (RCTs; n = 298), which were analyzed separately. The nonrandomized trials indicated a significant reduction in rates of preterm labor (p < 0.0006), intrauterine growth retardation (p <0.003), low birth weight (p < 0.01), pregnancy discomforts (p = 0.01), and perceived sleep disturbances (p = 0.03) in those who practiced yoga during pregnancy. Results of the RCTs indicated that doing yoga during pregnancy can significantly lower pain and discomfort (p < 0.05) and perceived stress (p = 0.001) and improve quality of life in physical domains (p = 0.001). All three RCTs were poorly compliant with the Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials statement. While awaiting an appropriately designed RCT to determine the benefits of yoga during pregnancy, it remains a viable exercise option.

AB  - Yoga is a mind-body practice that encompasses a system of postures (asana), deep breathing (pranayama), and meditation. Over 36 million Americans practice yoga of which the majority are reproductive-aged women. Literature to support this practice is limited, albeit on the rise. A prenatal yoga practice has been shown to benefit women who suffer from anxiety, depression, stress, low back pain, and sleep disturbances. A small number of studies have been performed in high-risk pregnancies that also demonstrate an improvement in outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Insomnia is the subjective complaint of poor sleep or an inadequate amount of sleep that adversely affects daily functioning. For the past 4 decades, treatment of insomnia has shifted away from the use of barbiturates toward the use of hypnotic agents of the benzodiazepine class. However, problems associated with the latter (eg, next-day sedation, rebound insomnia, dependence, and tolerance) have prompted development of other agents. OBJECTIVE: This review describes the recently approved nonbenzodiazepine agent, zaleplon. METHODS: Studies of zaleplon were identified through a search of English-language articles listed in MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, with no limitation on year. These were supplemented by educational materials from conferences. RESULTS: The efficacy and tolerability of zaleplon have been documented in the literature. Zaleplon has been shown to improve sleep variables in comparison with placebo. Like most hypnotic agents, zaleplon can be used for problems of sleep initiation at the beginning of the night, but its short duration of clinical effect may also allow patients to take it later in the night without residual effects the next morning. Zaleplon can be taken < or = 2 hours before awakening without 'hangover' effects. It is generally well tolerated, with headache being the most commonly reported adverse event in clinical trials (15%-18%). Compared with flurazepam, a long-acting benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agent, zaleplon causes significantly less psychomotor and cognitive impairment (P < 0.001). Zaleplon has not been studied in pregnant women or children. The dose of zaleplon should be individualized; the recommended daily dose for most adults is 10 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia has a substantial impact on daily functioning. If pharmacologic treatment is indicated for insomnia, the choice of an agent should be guided by individual patient characteristics.

AB  - Introduction: Women are particularly vulnerable to major depressive disorder sometime throughout their entire lifespan. Their highest risk coincides particularly during pregnancy due to various hormonal, immunological, structural and functional changes that enable the safe delivery of the newborn. In addition, the right sleep habits are important since they help the mother to ensure the necessary maternal energy in order to handle the fetal needs. Aim: To investigate the assessment of depression impact on the sleep habits of pregnant women and its determinants. Material and Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted and the study population consisted of 100 women from mid to late-term gestation (second and third trimester of pregnancy). Data were collected by means of an anonymous questionnaire that was completed voluntarily by the participants. Results: A statistically significant correlation was found between the depression during pregnancy score and the sleep quality score (p<0.001). Among the participants, 25% pregnant women in the study were found to be suffering from depression, while 93% reported that they had insufficient sleep during the last month. According to multivariate analysis, pregnant women with a higher level of education, being in a relationship, being employed and having moderate support from their family environment had lower depression score while older women had lower sleep quality score. Conclusions: The observation of high rate of depressive symptoms during pregnancy and its effect on the sleep habits of pregnant women confirms the necessity of early diagnosis and preventive actions.
AB  - Εισαγωγή: Οι γυναίκες είναι ιδιαίτερα επιρρεπείς στο να βιώσουν κατάθλιψη κάποια στιγμή στη ζωή τους. Μάλιστα, κατά τη διάρκεια της εγκυμοσύνης, η πιθανότητα αυτή είναι ακόμη μεγαλύτερη λόγω των ορμονικών, ανοσολογικών και λειτουργικών μεταβολών που συμβαίνουν. Επιπλέον, οι σωστές συνήθειες ύπνου είναι σημαντικές διότι βοηθούν στο να εξασφαλιστεί η απαραίτητη μητρική ενέργεια προκειμένου να καλυφθούν οι εμβρυικές ανάγκες. Σκοπός: Η εκτίμηση της επίδρασης της κατάθλιψης στις συνήθειες ύπνου των εγκύων και η εκτίμηση των προσδιοριστών που σχετίζονται με την κατάθλιψη και τις συνήθειες ύπνου των εγκύων. Υλικό και Μέθοδος: Πραγματοποιήθηκε μία συγχρονική μελέτη και ο μελετώμενος πληθυσμός αποτελούνταν από 100 γυναίκες που διένυαν το δεύτερο και τρίτο τρίμηνο της κυοφορίας τους. Για τη συλλογή των δεδομένων χρησιμοποιήθηκε ανώνυμο ερωτηματολόγιο, το οποίο συμπληρώθηκε εθελοντικά από τις συμμετέχουσες. Αποτελέσματα: Βρέθηκε θετική στατιστικά σημαντική συσχέτιση ανάμεσα στη βαθμολογία κατάθλιψης κατά τη διάρκεια της εγκυμοσύνης και τη βαθμολογία ποιότητας ύπνου (p<0,001). Το 25% των εγκύων στην μελέτη βρέθηκε ότι πάσχουν από πιθανή κατάθλιψη ενώ το 93% δήλωσαν ότι είχαν μη επαρκή ύπνο κατά τον τελευταίο μήνα. Οι γυναίκες που είχαν υψηλότερο επίπεδο εκπαίδευσης, που βρίσκονταν σε συμβίωση, που εργάζονταν και που είχαν μέτρια στήριξη από το οικογενειακό τους περιβάλλον είχαν μικρότερη βαθμολογία κατάθλιψης ενώ οι μεγαλύτερης ηλικίας γυναίκες είχαν μικρότερη βαθμολογία ποιότητας ύπνου. Συμπεράσματα: Η διαπίστωση υψηλού ποσοστού κατάθλιψης στις γυναίκες κατά τη διάρκεια της εγκυμοσύνης και η επίδραση της στις συνήθειες ύπνου των εγκύων επιβεβαιώνει την αναγκαιότητα έγκαιρης διάγνωσης της νόσου και στοχευμένων προληπτικών δράσεων.

AB  - Introduction: Obesity in childhood is one of the most important public health problems of the 21st century. Early influences, beginning in intrauterine environmental and continuing through the first few years of life, play important role in weight gain during childhood with consequences that last until adulthood. Purpose: This study is a literature review and aims to study the prenatal and perinatal factors affecting weight gain during early childhood. Materials and Methods: A bibliographical review of relevant articles was conducted at the electronic bases of PubMed and Scolar Google by key-words. Results: The prenatal and perinatal factors associated with weight gain and risk of obesity in children. The maternal smoking during pregnancy, the gestational weight gain and the occurrence of gestational diabetes, high birth weight of infant and short sleep duration are strong risk factors for childhood obesity, while breastfeeding has a protective effect against the increase of body weight. Conclusions: The period from conception to two years of age is a critical period for the appearance of overweight and obesity.

AB  - Backgrounds and Objectives: Changes that occur during pregnancy will definitely change the marital relationships of women. One of the changes in pregnancy is change in the pattern of sleep and insomnia. It is not clear whether there is a relationship between marital satisfaction during pregnancy and insomnia. This study was performed with the aim of determining the relationship between insomnia severity and marital satisfaction in pregnant women referring to health centers in Mashhad city. Methods: This cross-sectional correlational study was conducted on 126 pregnant women (with gestational age of 14-28 weeks) referred to health centers in Mashhad city in 2017. The data collection tool was a demographic questionnaire, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and ENRICH marital satisfaction scale. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation test, and multiple regression. Results: The mean age of the research units was 26.9±4.3 years, the gestational age was 19.0±2.9 weeks, and the number of pregnancy was 1.9±0.8. In the majority of research units, the insomnia severity was below the threshold (49.2%) and moderate marital satisfaction (57.9%). Based on Spearman's correlation coefficient, there was an inverse and significant linear relationship between insomnia severity and marital satisfaction (r=-0.52, p<0.001). Conclusion: Considering that the severity of insomnia in pregnant women has a significant effect on their marital satisfaction, therefore, caregivers' attention for the insomnia of pregnant women and performing care measures for its reduction, are necessary.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of aroma inhalation therapy on stress, anxiety, depression, and an autonomic nervous system reaction in high-risk hospitalized pregnant women. Methods: A quasi-experimental study used a non-equivalent control group non-synchronized design. Fifty high-risk hospitalized pregnant women were selected as participants on delivery room and maternity ward at university hospital. Twenty-five were selected for the experimental group while 25 were assigned to a control group. Neroli essential oil was used for aroma therapy and was already identified as not being hazard to pregnant women. It provided emotional stability from previous study. The participants inhaled Neroli 2 minutes, 3 times (9 am to 10 am, 4 pm to 5 pm, just before sleep) a day. A total of 15 sessions were held from the day of the preliminary investigation. Pre and post written survey and measuring an autonomic nervous system reaction were collected from both groups. Results: The data were analyzed by χ² test, t-test, and paired t-test. There was a statistically significant difference in stress (t=-3.98, p<.001) between the experimental group and the control group. Conclusion: These findings indicate that aroma inhalation therapy is effective as a nursing intervention for the stress relief of hospitalized high-risk pregnant women.
