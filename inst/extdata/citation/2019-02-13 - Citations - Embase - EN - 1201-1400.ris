N2  - Introduction: Previous study showed children with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) demonstrating more emotional, behavior problems such as hyperactivity, and lower social competency. Premature infants have more SDB problems than full-term infants.We wondered whether there is a relationship between sleep problems and emotional and behavior problems in preterm infants. Materials and methods: We enrolled neonates of gestational age less than 37 weeks. Basic obstetric and birth data were collected as baseline data. The participants were followed up at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and at every 6 months of corrected age. Premature infants were tested by actigraphy, and night-time polysomnography initially. They were followed up and evaluated for their sleep habit with Chinese Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (CBISQ) and sleep diary. They were also assessed development with Bailey-Scales of Infant Development (BSID) - II and the Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST). These assessments were done and filled out by the parents or the caregivers at each visit. The infant emotional and social behavior were evaluated by Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA), and Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile (CSBS DP) Infant-Toddler Checklist. The raw data were analyzed with the software PASW Statistics (SPSS) version 18. Demographic statistics were performed by t test and chi-squared test. Correlation of emotional, behavior and sleep data was analyzed by Pearson's correlation. Results: We enrolled 201 premature infants, but only 88 subjects completed all examination and questionnaire assessments at each visit. The mean of gestation age was 31.56 ± 3.19 weeks, and the mean of birth body weight was 1684.80 ± 543.04 g. Enrolled premature infants were divided into two groups: Group 1: premature infants with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 1 and Group 2: infants with AHI < 1. DDST shows a highly significant difference in gross motor skill between Group 1 and Group 2. The other three categories also showed more problems in Group 1 than in Group 2. Although BSIDII results showed no significant difference between these two groups, MDI and PDI showed more problems in Group 1 than in Group 2. BITSEA showed significant difference in problem composition and competence composition (p = 0.000). In CSBS DP result, the symbolic composite is highly significant with p = 0.03. The means of the other three composites and total score were higher also in Group 1 than in Group 2. Conclusion: Our data showed that preterm infants with SBD have greater impairment in mental and motor development compared with those without SDB. Also the SDB-preterm infants have more emotional, social function, and symbolic behavior development delay.

N2  - Background The purpose of this paper was to evaluate relationships between sociodemographic, pregnancy, obstetric, and postnatal variables and postpartum depression, anxiety and stress levels in new mothers. Method One-hundred-thirty-nine women completed the baseline questionnaire and 105 completed the follow-up questionnaire at 4-6 months postpartum. Sociodemographic and pregnancy factors were assessed at baseline, birth and postnatal factors were assessed at time 2, and depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed at both time points. Results Caesarean delivery was associated with high postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Child sleep problems was related to depression, child health problems were related to anxiety, more SLE related to high stress, and maternal sleep problems were related to PPD. However, the results became non-significant after controlling for antenatal distress levels. Finally, women who underwent caesarean delivery had higher antenatal stress, anxiety, and depression levels, relative to women who did not undergo the procedure. Conclusion Psychological stress and distress tended to persist in the women from the third-trimester of pregnancy to 4-6 months postpartum. It tended to occur in the context of caesarean delivery, maternal sleep problems, child's health and sleep problems, and stressful life-events.

N2  - Introduction: As sleep problems are common in Asia, this study investigated if sleep plays a role in predicting developmental outcomes in Singaporean children. Most research is based on cross-sectional studies. Here we investigated whether sleep quality measured by nocturnal wakefulness at 3-months predicts cognitive, language and motor performance at 24-months. Materials and methods: In this study a subset of 159 infants were included from the larger Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort study (Soh et al., 2013). Inclusion criteria were term born infants between 37 and 41 of gestational age, APGAR score ≥9, normal birth weight (2500-4000 g), and no maternal complications during pregnancy. Primary caregivers completed the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (Sadeh, 2004) when the infants were 3- and 24-months old. Nocturnal wakefulness was assessed by the question 'How much time does your child spend in wakefulness from the time he/she falls asleep in the evening to waking up the following morning?'. The Bayley scales of infant and toddler development screening assessment was conducted during a home visit when the infants were 24-months old. The data for nocturnal wakefulness were square-root transformed due to a positive skew and standard Z-scores were calculated. Nocturnal wakefulness at age 3-months and Bayley's cognitive, language and motor measures age 24-months were analyzed using generalized linear models in SPSS, controlling for effects of gender, ethnicity and maternal education. Results: Increased amount of time spent in nocturnal wakefulness during infancy predicted poorer Bayley's scaled scores for across the cognitive, language and motor domains. For the cognitive scale, every 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in 3-months' nocturnal wakefulness (i.e. poor sleep quality) predicted a 0.67 point decrease in Bayley's cognitive scores (t154 = -2.58, p = .011). For the language scale, every 1 SD increase in nocturnal wakefulness predicted a 0.81 and a 0.58 decrease in receptive language (t153 = -2.98, p = 0.003) and expressive language scores respectively (t153 = -2.51, p = 0.013). In addition to cognition and language, every 1 SD increase in nocturnal wakefulness also predicted a 0.75 decreased in gross motor performance (t152 = -2.50, p = 0.013). In contrast, there was no significant relationship between 3-months nocturnal wakefulness and 24-month fine motor performance (t153 = -0.87, p = 0.39). Conclusion: Since longer nocturnal wakefulness is a marker of poor sleep quality, results highlight that early measures of infant sleep quality from as young as 3-months of age are useful predictors of cognitive, language, motor performance during toddlerhood. This suggests that sleep is important for multiple developmental outcomes throughout childhood.

N2  - Evidence of the short term relationship between maternal and fetal heart rates has been found in previous studies. However there is still limited knowledge about underlying mechanisms and patterns of the coupling throughout gestation. In this study, Transfer Entropy (TE) was used to quantify directed interactions between maternal and fetal heart rates at various time delays and gestational ages. Experimental results using maternal and fetal electrocardiograms showed significant coupling for 63 out of 65 fetuses, by statistically validating against surrogate pairs. Analysis of TE showed a decrease in transfer of information from fetus to the mother with gestational age, alongside the maturation of the fetus. On the other hand, maternal to fetal TE was significantly greater in mid (26-31 weeks) and late (32-41 weeks) gestation compared to early (16-25 weeks) gestation (Mann Whitney Wilcoxon (MWW) p<0.05). TE further increased from mid to late, for the fetuses with RMSSD of fetal heart rate being larger than 4 msec in the late gestation. This difference was not observed for the fetuses with smaller RMSSD, which could be associated with the quiet sleep state. Delay in the information transfer from mother to fetus significantly decreased (p = 0.03) from mid to late gestation, implying a decrease in fetal response time. These changes occur concomitant with the maturation of the fetal sensory and autonomic nervous systems with advancing gestational age. The effect of maternal respiratory rate derived from maternal ECG was also investigated and no significant relationship was found between breathing rate and TE at any lag. In conclusion, the application of TE with delays revealed detailed information on the fetal-maternal heart rate coupling strength and latency throughout gestation, which could provide novel clinical markers of fetal development and well-being.

N2  - Introduction Maternal antenatal depression is associated with an increased risk of emotional and behavioural problems in children. More recently antenatal depression has been associated with shorter sleep duration, higher number of awakenings and sleep problems in infants. Examining the effect of treatment of depression on child development is the next step in unravelling the complex association between antenatal depression and offspring development. Methods We used data from a pilot RCT of women with antenatal depression who received either Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) or Treatment as Usual (TAU), to examine infant sleep duration and temperament two months postpartum. Data was available for n=14 in the CBT group and n=11 in the TAU group. Results No differences by treatment arm were evident. Improvement in depression scores during pregnancy was associated with easier temperament (β=-.45, p=.024) and shorter nocturnal sleep duration (β=-.58, p=.003). The findings were more pronounced in the CBT group compared to the TAU group. Limitations This was a pilot RCT and as such the sample size was small and there was some loss to follow up between the baseline and postnatal assessment. Conclusion Improvement in antenatal depressive symptoms may have beneficial effects for the infant; whether these are directly through effects on foetal development or indirectly through changes in the postnatal mother-infant relationship remains to be determined.

N2  - Background Postnatal depression affects the well-being of women and families. While several studies have shown an association between mode of birth and symptoms of postnatal depression, others have found no relationship. Aims To determine whether women who have instrumental or caesarean births report higher levels of poor coping, sleep or appetite disturbance, or relationship difficulties, than women who have vaginal births, at the time of Universal Postnatal Contact (7-10 days post-discharge). Materials and Methods Retrospective cohort study of term, singleton births from 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2013 at a tertiary obstetric facility. Outcomes were compared for 1816 women having vaginal births versus 1205 women having instrumental or caesarean births. Results When adjusted for confounders, no association could be demonstrated between mode of birth and reporting of any postnatal symptom of psychological morbidity. However, the model did demonstrate an association between reporting of symptoms and nulliparity (aOR 1.69 (1.08-2.63); P = 0.02), as well as having an unplanned pregnancy with a supportive partner (aOR 0.54 (0.29-0.97); P = 0.04). Conclusions Mode of birth does not appear to be associated with the reporting of symptoms of psychological morbidity in the early postnatal period. However, these symptoms may be associated with nulliparity and in the context of an unplanned pregnancy, a lack of partner support. These findings highlight the ongoing need for antenatal screening with respect to pregnancy intention and the presence of a social support system, to facilitate the implementation of interventions for women at risk of postnatal depression.

N2  - Introduction: Women living with HIV experience a disproportionate burden of mental health issues. To date, global guidelines contain insufficient guidance on mental health support, particularly regarding perinatal care. The aim of this article is to describe the extent and impact of mental health issues as experienced by women living with HIV on their sexual and reproductive health and human rights (SRH&HR). Methods: A global, mixed-methods, user-led and designed survey on SRH&HR of women living with HIV was conducted using snowball sampling, containing an optional section exploring mental health issues. Statistical quantitative data analysis included descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple linear regression analysis for the mental health responses. Thematic analysis of open free-text responses was performed for qualitative data. Results: A total of 832 respondents from 94 countries participated in the online survey with 489 responses to the optional mental health section. Of the respondents, 82% reported depression symptoms and 78% rejection. One-fifth reported mental health issues before HIV diagnosis. Respondents reported experiencing a 3.5-fold higher number of mental health issues after diagnosis (8.71 vs 2.48, t[488] 23.00, p<0.001). Nearly half (n=224; 45.8%) had multiple socially disadvantaged identities (SDIs). The number of SDIs was positively correlated with experiencing mental health issues (p<0.05). Women described how mental health issues affected their ability to enjoy their right to sexual and reproductive health and to access services. These included depression, rejection and social exclusion, sleep problems, intersectional stigma, challenges with sexual and intimate relationships, substance use and sexual risk, reproductive health barriers and human rights (HR) violations. Respondents recommended that policymakers and clinicians provide psychological support and counselling, funding for peer support and interventions to challenge gender-based violence and to promote HR. Conclusions: Interventions addressing intersecting stigmas and any especial impacts of diagnosis during pregnancy are required to ensure women's SRH&HR. Global policy guidelines regarding women living with HIV must incorporate mental health considerations.

N2  - Objective: Our first aim was to investigate the effects of caffeine on preterm infants' respiratory functions and brain cortical activity (conventional and amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (cEEG and aEEG)). Secondary aim was to study its long-term effects on respiratory system and electroencephalographic maturation by 36 weeks post-menstrual age.Methods: Prospective observational study on 33 consecutively admitted preterm infants less than 34-weeks-gestation. cEEG and aEEG, cardiopulmonary and sleep state were recorded in 20 preterm infants, before, during and 2-hours after intravenous (IV) caffeine (caffeine Group), and for 13 preterms (control group). Both groups were subjected to assessment of cerebral cortical maturation by cEEG and aEEG at 36-weeks post-menstrual age as an outcome measure.Results: IV caffeine administration significantly increased heart rate (p = 0.000), mean arterial blood pressure (p = 0.000), capillary oxygen saturation (p = 0.003), arousability (p = 0.000) and aEEG continuity (p = 0.002) after half an hour. No clinical seizures were recorded and non-significant difference was found in electrographic seizures activity in cEEG. At 36-weeks post-conceptional age, NICU stay was significantly longer in controls (p = 0.022). aEEG score was significantly higher in caffeine group than the control group, (p = 0.000).Conclusions: Caffeine increases preterm infants cerebral cortical activity during infusion and results in cerebral cortical maturation at 36weeks, without increase in seizure activity.

N2  - Background: Common mental disorder (CMD) and sleep disturbance are two common conditions among women in late pregnancy, affecting up to 20% and 63% of women, respectively, and may adversely affect their quality of life.Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between sleep disturbance in pregnancy and persistent CMD among low-income pregnant women living in Brazil.Methods: This was a prospective cohort study conducted with pregnant women recruited from public primary care clinics in São Paulo, Brazil. We performed a longitudinal analysis of 219 women who had CMD from the Self-Report Questionnaire during the 20-30 weeks of pregnancy. Two groups were examined: (1) those who had CMD remission in the postpartum and (2) those who had persistent CMD in the postpartum (measured once in the postpartum period). Poisson regression was used to estimate the degree of association between sleep disturbance in pregnancy and the risk for persistent CMD postpartum.Results: After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors, sleep disturbance during pregnancy is associated with persistent CMD (RR = 1.36, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.84).Conclusion: In this sample of low-income pregnant women living in Brazil, the presence of sleep disturbance during pregnancy was associated with persistent common mental disorder in the postpartum period. Identification of sleep disturbance in pregnant women with CMD will be important in order to recognize those women at higher risk of persistent CMD in the postpartum period.

N2  - Research suggests that anxiety and disturbed sleep in pregnancy may predict postpartum depression (PPD). However, limited research on stress-related physiological mechanisms linking these factors to PPD exists. This study explores the associations among stress-reactive physiology, anxious symptoms, and sleep disturbances in pregnancy as predictors of PPD symptomatology. Fourteen nulliparous women in the second trimester of a singleton pregnancy entered our longitudinal study which includes (1) baseline assessments; (2) two weeks of home sleep monitoring (actigraphy and prospective diaries); (3) speech and math laboratory psychosocial stressor paradigm (22-24 weeks gestation); and (4) postpartum mood assessment (data collection in progress). Blunted progesterone reactivity to stress predicted increased anxiety (r =-0.66, p = 0.02), while blunted cortisol reactivity predicted subjective and objectively-measured sleep disturbances, including sleep onset latency (SOL; r =-0.64, p = 0.02), wake after sleep onset (WASO; r =-0.85, p = 0.001), sleep fragmentation index (FI; r =-0.66, p = 0.02), and sleep quality (PSQI; r =-0.74, p = 0.001). Like cortisol, HR reactivity to stress was inversely correlated with objective SOL, WASO, and FI (r's =-0.73 to -0.54, p's = 0.01-0.05). Both SBP and DBP stress reactivity inversely predicted SOL (r =-0.55 and -0.67, p's < .05). A blunted neuroendocrine and cardiovascular response to stress predicted increased anxious symptomatology and sleep disturbances in second trimester women. Since disturbed sleep in pregnancy may predict development of PPD, these data suggest that altered stress reactivity may mediate the link between early pregnancy sleep disturbance and PPD.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to test the efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in pregnant women with restless legs syndrome (RLS) and iron deficiency or anemia. The open-label pilot study (exploratory) was performed at the University Hospital of Zürich and the Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland (Lugano). Patient and Methods: Nineteen women in the third trimester of pregnancy with moderate-to-severe RLS and serum ferritin levels <35 μg/l or hemoglobin (Hb) < 11.0 g/dl were included in the study. RLS was graded according to the International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Study Group rating scale. All participants had a score of ≥20 or had RLS ≥3 times/week. Based on the Hb levels, 500 or 700 mg of FCM was administered over 20 min. The primary end point was a ≥ 50% reduction in the mean IRLS score one week after FCM infusion. The secondary end points included periodic limb movements (PLMs; assessed using nocturnal foot actigraphy), sleep quality (assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and safety. Results: The IRLS score decreased from 23 ± 7 (baseline) to 13 ± 7 (P < 0.01), whereas the PLM index decreased from 35 ± 26 (baseline) to 25 ± 20 (P < 0.001). Significant improvement in sleep quality was also reported (P < 0.029), and treatment was well tolerated. Three serious adverse events were reported, but they were considered unrelated to treatment. Conclusions: These data provide promising evidence on the safety and efficacy of FCM for moderate-to-severe RLS in pregnant women with iron deficiency or anemia. Therefore, a future placebo-controlled study is warranted.

N2  - Sleep disorders are common in pregnancy. Typically, pregnancy-associated sleep disorders start from excessive sleepiness during the first trimester, subsequent temporal improvement in the second trimester, and increased incidences of insomnia and nocturnal awakenings during the third trimester. Symptoms are most prevalent in the third trimester, and sometimes the disorders range from parasomnia such as restless legs syndrome to snoring because of maternal sleep apnea syndrome. Besides, uncontrolled maternal depression can also cause sleep disturbance in any period of pregnancy. Despite problematic symptoms, pregnant women rarely take hypnotics given the risk of major congenital anomaly. Benzodiazepines (triazolam, brotizolam, lormetazepam, flunitrazepam, and nitrazepam) or non-benzodiazepines (zopiclone and zolpidem) are commonly prescribed as hypnotics. Historically, warnings were issued over the associations between maternal use of benzodiazepines in pregnancy and fetal oral cleft palate. A meta-analysis published in 1998 provided basic knowledge about this controversy. In an analysis of cohort studies, fetal exposure to benzodiazepines was not associated with major malformations (odds ratio 0.90; 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.35) or oral cleft (1.19; 0.34 to 4.15). Analysis of case-control studies showed an association between exposure to benzodiazepines and development of major malformations (3.01; 1.32 to 6.84) or oral cleft alone (1.79; 1.13 to 2.82). Thus, with regard to the study design, it is suggested that the results of cohort study can be selected for a higher level of evidence. These lines of evidence have also been confirmed by the following two prospective cohort studies. Benzodiazepines do not seem to be major human teratogens.

N2  - Objective: Controversies exist regarding the impact of co-sleeping on infant sleep quality. In this context, the current study examined: (a) the differences in objective and subjective sleep patterns between co-sleeping (mostly room-sharing) and solitary sleeping mother-infant dyads; (b) the predictive links between maternal sleep during pregnancy and postnatal sleeping arrangement; (c) the bi-directional prospective associations between sleeping arrangement and infant/maternal sleep quality at three and six months postpartum. Methods: The sample included 153 families recruited during pregnancy. Data were obtained in home settings during the third trimester of pregnancy and at three and six months postpartum. Mothers were asked to monitor their own sleep and their infants' sleep for five nights using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Questionnaires were used to assess sleeping arrangements, feeding methods, socio-demographic characteristics, and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Results: Mothers of co-sleeping infants reported more infant night-wakings than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. However, none of the objective sleep measures was significantly different between co-sleeping and solitary sleeping infants, after controlling for feeding techniques. Co-sleeping mothers had significantly more objective and subjective sleep disturbances than mothers in the solitary sleeping group. Moreover, poorer maternal sleep during pregnancy and at three months postpartum predicted higher levels of co-sleeping at six months. Conclusion: Mothers of co-sleeping infants report more infant night-wakings, and experience poorer sleep than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. The quality of maternal sleep should be taken into clinical consideration when parents consult about co-sleeping.

N2  - Sleep in women differs in many respects from that of men. In general, women appear to report a greater need for sleep and more subjective complaints of non-refreshing sleep than men. Sleep in women is affected at least partially by hormonal factors, with women typically suffering from sleep disturbance in connection with the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause Menstrual cycles are associated with prominent changes in reproductive hormones that may influence sleep. Sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome may be aggravated by pregnancy. Women may also develop insomnia during pregnancy, childbirth and menopause.

N2  - Kisspeptin is an essential gatekeeper of reproductive function. During pregnancy high circulating levels of kisspeptin have been described, however the clear role of this neuropeptide in pregnancy remains unknown. We tested the existence of rhythmic kisspeptin expression in human full-term placenta from healthy pregnant women at six different time points during the day. The data obtained by Western blotting were fitted to a mathematical model (Fourier series), demonstrating, for the first time, the existence of a circadian rhythm in placental kisspeptin expression.

N2  - Fever has been recognized as an important symptom of disease since ancient times. For many years, fever was treated as a putative life-threatening phenomenon. More recently, it has been recognized as an important part of the body's defense mechanisms; indeed at times it has even been used as a therapeutic agent. The knowledge of the functional role of the central nervous system in the genesis of fever has greatly improved over the last decade. It is clear that the febrile process, which develops in the sick individual, is just one of many brain-controlled sickness symptoms. Not only will the sick individual appear "feverish" but they may also display a range of behavioral changes, such as anorexia, fatigue, loss of interest in usual daily activities, social withdrawal, listlessness or malaise, hyperalgesia, sleep disturbances and cognitive dysfunction, collectively termed "sickness behavior". In this review we consider the issue of whether fever and sickness behaviors are friend or foe during: a critical illness, the common cold or influenza, in pregnancy and in the newborn. Deciding whether these sickness responses are beneficial or harmful will very much shape our approach to the use of antipyretics during illness.

N2  - Aims: Fetal smoking exposure is a risk factor for preterm birth. Both smoking exposure and preterm birth are associated with an elevated incidence of early and long-term cardiovascular dysfunction. However, there is still no direct evidence to show that in utero exposure to smoking alters the dynamics of cardiac autonomic control in sleeping preterm neonates. Methods and Results: We studied healthy, preterm neonates (postmenstrual age: 36.2±0.9weeks) born to mothers who had smoked throughout pregnancy but not since birth (n=16). In uteroexposed neonates were matched with control preterm neonates born to nonsmoking mothers (n=18). Cardiac autonomic control was monitored as a function of the sleep state by assessing heart rate variability with both linear and non-linear methods. Preterm neonates with in utero exposure to smoking displayed alterations (relative to control neonates) in short-term cardiac autonomic control in all sleep states. These alterations included low vagal activity, elevated sympathetic activity, and low complexity and adaptability in heart rate control dynamics. Conclusion: Our results constitute direct evidence that cardiac autonomic activity and control are altered in preterm infants exposed to smoking in utero. These alterations may place the affected infants at a higher risk of neurological and cardiovascular complications, which could conceivably persist throughout childhood and adulthood.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a potentially debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by feelings of guilt, anhedonia, and sadness, and may involve dysfunction in cognition, sleep, appetite, and energy. In particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely applied to identify the key brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD. Several meta-analyses of region-of-interest and voxel-based morphometry structural MRI studies in MDD have been reported, providing evidence of volume reductions in the hippocampus, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as well as caudate and putamen1. However, there have been a number of non-replications and contrasting results across studies. A number of explanations for the great variability in findings have been proposed including age of the sample examined, medication status, illness severity, sex, and age of MDD onset. One important confounding variable may be smoking behavior, since smoking has been associated with a range of mental disorders including schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and depression. Studies in healthy controls have found associations between cigarette smoking and a variety of adverse central nervous system effects, such as global brain atrophy, and structural abnormalities in prefrontal regions as well as reduced gray matter (GM) volumes in the anterior cingulate, occipital and temporal cortices including the parahippocampal structures and hippocampal substructures2. Thus, smoking status might impact gray matter volumes in studies with psychiatric populations. In line with this, a recent study found that a proportion of the volume reduction seen in the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia is associated with smoking rather than with the diagnosis of schizophrenia2. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that has specifically evaluated the underlying brain structural changes that may mediate the impact of smoking status in MDD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of smoking status on gray matter volumes in MDD patients. As most previous studies found smaller gray-matter volumes in smokers than nonsmokers, we hypothesized that MDD participants who smoke cigarettes would exhibit lower gray-matter volume in ACC, OFC and subcortical structures compared with non-smoker MDD patients. METHODS: Participants: Forty MDD participants (20 smokers and 20 non-smokers) were recruited from outpatients at the Department of Psychiatry, Bozyaka Education and Research Hospital. All MDD participants were diagnosed by two trained psychiatrists individually using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-4 and met the following inclusion criteria: fulfilling DSM-4 criteria for major depressive disorder; aged 18 to 65; no comorbid other Axis I psychiatric disorders; currently experiencing an episode of depression with a score of at least 20 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) and medication-free for at least 2 months. Exclusion criteria for all participants were: less than 18 years of age; any MRI contraindications; pregnancy; history of head injury or neurological disorder and any concomitant medical disorder. All participants were right-handed, underwent baseline clinical assessment and MRI scan within 48 hours of initial contact. Nicotine dependence levels were assessed with the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). All participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study. The study was approved by local research and ethics committees. Image Data Acquisition: All MRI scans were performed on a 1.5T Achieva MR imager (Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, Netherlands) with a standard quadrature head coil. All subjects were scanned with a 3D T1-weighted turbo gradient echo sequence with SENSE using the following parameters: coronal orientation, matrix 256 x 256, 1 x 1 mm2 in-plane resolution, slice thickness 1 mm, TE/TR=5.6/12ms, flip angle α=19o. Statistical Analysis: Demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed using an independent-samples t-test with significance set at p<0.05. If data did not meet the assumptions required to perform parametric analysis, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. For the MRI data, the structural data was analyzed with FSL-VBM3 (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLVBM), an optimized VBM protocol carried out with FSL tools. Briefly, structural images were skull-stripped and then tissue-segmented into gray matter, white matter, and CSF. The resulting gray matter partial volume images were aligned to MNI152 standard space using an affine followed by a nonlinear registration with the Image Registration Toolkit. The resulting images were averaged to create a study-specific template, to which the native gray matter images were then non-linearly re-registered. The registered partial volume-segmented images were modulated (to correct for local expansion or contraction) by the Jacobian of the warp field and smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel with FWHM=7mm. The Harvard-Oxford Cortical and Subcortical Structural Atlases implemented in FSL were used to create masks for our regions of interest (ROIs): the left and right hippocampus, left and right amygdala, left and right caudate, left and right putamen, ACC and OFC. Probability range was set to 50 % for all 10 structures. Finally, to compare groups, a voxel-wise general linear model was applied using permutation-based (5000 permutations) non-parametric testing, correcting for multiple comparisons across space. First, volumes were compared in our ROIs, using the created masks. Second, an exploratory whole-brain analysis was done, using the gray matter image from the study-specific template to investigate whether any not predicted differences existed between groups. RESULTS: Demographic and Clinical Characteristics: We did not find any significant differences in age, years of education, number of depressive episodes, age at first episode, duration of current depressive episode, HDRS-17 scores and body mass index scores between the groups. VBM Results: The VBM ROI analyses showed that left hippocampus (p= 0.009), right caudate (p= 0.015), left amygdala (p= 0.020) and right amygdala (p= 0.024) volumes were smaller in smokers with MDD compared to non-smokers with MDD. We found no group differences for the volumes in the ROIs for the right hippocampus, left caudate, left and right putamen, ACC and orbitofrontal cortex. The exploratory whole-brain analysis did not reveal any gray matter volume differences between smokers with MDD and non-smokers with MDD. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically examine the impact of smoking status on gray matter volumes in patients with MDD. We hypothesized that differences in smoking behavior in MDD might explain the variability of GM volume reductions reported in the literature. We found that compared to non-smoker MDD patients, smoker MDD patients showed significantly lower volumes in the left hippocampus, right and left amygdala and the right caudate. It is important to consider that the two patient groups did not differ in their disease severity. The results of our study are in line with previous investigations in healthy controls suggesting that smoking may impact GM volumes of hippocampus, amygdala and caudate4; however, other studies have found more widespread differences in the cortex between smokers and non-smokers5. Discrepancies may be attributable to the small sample sizes or to the differential patterns of smoking behavior assessed across studies. One possible interpretation of our results is that volume differences in the hippocampus, amygdala and caudate in smoker MDD patients vs. non-smoker MDD patients may be more related to adverse effects of cigarette smoke or to an interaction between smoking and a primary pathological process that affects neurons of the hippocampus and other brain regions. Also, the possibility that MDD patients who smoke carry genetic variants that increase the susceptibility for MDD and addictive behavior cannot be excluded. Due to the cross-sectional design of our study, we were not able to measure causal relationships. Thus, it is conceivable that MDD patients with more pronounced structural brain changes are more prone to smoking. Our findings need to be viewed in light of some limitations. Firstly, the study sample is small and the findings need to be replicated in other populations and in a larger sample. Secondly, this is a cross-sectional study and the longitudinal follow-up of these subjects would proffer further insights into the complex interaction between smoking status, illness factors and changes in brain gray matter volumes. A third limitation is the lack of a control group, and at this time we are reporting preliminary results based on only 40 patients, 20 in each group. In conclusion, our preliminary data suggest that volumetric reductions previously reported in MDD may be partially attributable to smoking, especially in subcortical structures. Therefore, we recommend an assessment of smoking status in future MRI studies in samples including psychiatric patients.

N2  - During growth and puberty profound changes in metabolic/endocrine compartments are paralleled by the maturation of various hormone systems (e. g. sex-steroid axis, bone health, lipid and glucose homeostasis). On the one hand, things often change with epilepsy and the disease per se might influence enzyme systems. On the other hand, antiepileptic drugs (AED) are well known to elicit diverse neuroendocrine changes. Data concerning the thyroid axis are far from conclusive but regular measurement of serum hormones is recommended. Monitoring of bone health in children and adolescents with epilepsy comprises a thorough evaluation of the risk profile and periodic determination of vitamin D concentrations. To achieve maximum safety, the use of an oral contraceptive containing a progestin dose above that needed to inhibit ovulation without a pill-free interval (a so-called “long cycle”) is suggested. Furthermore, the use of additional barrier methods or – alternatively – classic or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices should be taken into consideration. In the case of pregnancy, extensive instruction concerning sleep and compliance, as well as frequent determination of AED serum levels are necessary. When lamotrigine is combined with an oral contraceptive, physicians should be aware of decreasing lamotrigine concentrations, whereas mid-cycle bleedings might point towards loss of contraceptive safety. To sum up, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to monitor possible neuro-endocrine alterations that warrant further examination and treatment, especially in adolescent girls and boys.

N2  - Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure without ventriculomegaly or intracranial tumor with normal cerebrospinal fluid, causing signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. The risk factors include: obesity, use of oral contraceptives, pregnancy and obstructive sleep apnea. The diagnostic criteria are symptoms and signs that reflect intracranial hypertension or papilledema, intracranial pressure greater than 250 mm of H2O, composition of normal CSF and imaging study without evidence of ventricular dilatation, tumor, vascular damage or structural injury in MRI or contrasted CT of brain. The therapeutic management should be based on reducing the intracranial pressure, in order to relieve headache and preserve vision.

N2  - The aim of this study was to observe the influence of interfered circadian rhythm on pregnancy of rats and growth of neonatal rats, and to explore the relationship between the interfered circadian rhythm and the changes of melatonin and progesterone. Continuous light was used to inhibit melatonin secretion and therefore the interfered circadian rhythm animal model was obtained. The influence of interfered circadian rhythm on delivery of pregnant rats was observed. Serum was collected from rats during different stages of pregnancy to measure the concentrations of melatonin and progesterone. In order to observe the embryo resorption rate, half of pregnant rats were randomly selected to undergo a laparotomy, and the remainder was used to observe delivery and assess the growth of neonatal rats after delivery. The results showed that the interfered circadian rhythm induced adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes, including an increase of embryo resorption rate and a decrease in the number of live births; inhibited the secretion of melatonin along with decreased serum progesterone level; prolonged the stage of labor, but not the duration of pregnancy; and disturbed the fetal intrauterine growth and the growth of neonatal rats. The results suggest that interfered circadian rhythm condition made by continuous light could make adverse effects on both pregnant rats and neonatal rats. The results of our study may provide a way to modulate pregnant women's circadian rhythm and a possibility of application of melatonin on pregnant women.

N2  - Background: In recent years, there is considerable evidence of a relationship between the sensorimotor disorder restless legs syndrome (RLS) and pain disorders, including migraine and fibromyalgia. An association between multi-site pain and RLS has been reported in adult women. In the current study, we explored the association between musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and RLS in a large cohort of young adults. Methods: Twenty two year olds (n∈=∈1072), followed since birth of part of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, provided data on MSK pain (duration, severity, frequency, number of pain sites). RLS was considered present when 4 diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group were met (urge to move, dysaesthesia, relief by movement, worsening symptoms during the evening/night) and participants had these symptoms at least 5 times per month. Associations between MSK pain and RLS were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression with bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals, with final models adjusted for sex, psychological distress and sleep quality. Results: The prevalence of RLS was 3.0 % and MSK pain was reported by 37.4 % of the participants. In multivariable logistic regression models, strong associations were found between RLS-diagnosis and long duration (three months or more) of MSK pain (odds ratio 3.6, 95 % confidence interval 1.4-9.2) and reporting three or more pain sites (4.9, 1.6-14.6). Conclusions: Different dimensions of MSK pain were associated with RLS in young adults, suggestive of shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Overlap between these conditions requires more clinical and research attention.

N2  - Objective: Mechanistic pathways linking maternal long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) status with gestational length are poorly delineated. Key LC-PUFAs implicated in this association are the antiinflammatory omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and proinflammatory omega-6 arachidonic acid (AA). We hypothesized that (1) lower red blood cell (RBC) DHA:AA ratios would predict shorter gestation and (2) this effect would be mediated by both inflammation and sleep quality. Methods: Pregnant women (n = 135) provided blood and completed the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index at 20-27 weeks gestation. RBC fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography and serum inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, IL-1b, CRP) were deter-mined by high-sensitivity ELISA. Results: Lower DHA:AA ratios predicted higher serum IL-8 (r=-0.20, p = 0.02) and poorer sleep quality (b =-13.8, p = 0.02). These relationships remained after adjusting for depressive symptoms, age, BMI, income, race, and smoking. Mediational analyses demonstrated indirect effects linking lower RBC DHA:AA with shorter gestation via higher IL-8 (95% CI = 0.10, 3.84) and poor sleep (95% CI = 0.35, 3.99). A significant race X DHA:AA interaction in predicting preterm birth (PTB) was observed (p = 0.049); among African Americans only, the odds of PTB decreased significantly as DHA:AA increased (OR for 0.1 unit increase = 0.25 (95% CI = 0.06, 0.99, p = 0.048). Discussion: These data support both inflammatory pathways and sleep quality as significant mediators linking maternal DHA:AA status and length of gestation. African Americans may be at greater risk for PTB related to suboptimal DHA levels.

N2  - Macrophage migratory inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pluripotent cytokine that can counter-regulate the anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids. In pregnancy, MIF may circumvent the effects of glucocorticoid-mediated immunosuppression; higher levels of MIF have been associated with preeclampsia and preterm labor. Elevated MIF has been associated with sleep disorders. Given that sleep disturbance is common during pregnancy, we investigated the association between sleep parameters and levels of MIF. We also investigated whether MIF levels were associated with pregnancy complications. Pregnant women (N = 184) provided sleep information from sleep diaries and actigraphy at T1 (10-12), T2 (14-16), and T3 (18-20) weeks gestation. Plasma MIF levels were assayed at T1 and T3 using a commercial sandwich ELISA. Pregnancy outcomes were obtained from delivery records. We observed no significant associations between any of the sleep variables and MIF values. However, we did observe an association between MIF levels at T3 and risk of pregnancy complications, including hypertension, pre-term labor/delivery, preeclampsia and PROM (b = 9.25, p =.033). MIF is thought to be an important determinant of the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory processes and thus, may play an important role in pregnancy outcomes. However, the empirical evidence available regarding MIF in human pregnancy is limited. The null finding for sleep may be resultant of the normal compensatory/adaptation processes that occur following conception in order to protect the fetus. Additional work is required.

N2  - Objectives: Childhood abuse is associated with increased risks of adult psychiatric disorders and physical health conditions. Mounting evidence documents associations of childhood abuse with sleep disturbances in adulthood. However, to date, no study has evaluated associations of childhood abuse and sleep disturbances among pregnant women. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 634 pregnant Peruvian women. To collect information regarding socio-demographic characteristics, history of childhood abuse, and complaints of sleep disturbances, face-to-face interviews were conducted with women in early pregnancy. Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST-S) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-S), translated from English to Spanish, were used to assess stress-related sleep disturbance and sleep quality, respectively. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: Women who experienced any childhood abuse had a 1.65-fold increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.15-2.38) and 2.11-fold increased odds of poor sleep quality during early pregnancy (aOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.35-3.30) as compared with women who reported no abuse. Women who reported both physical and sexual abuse during childhood were more than twice as likely to suffer from stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.44-3.53) and poor sleep quality (aOR = 2.43; 95% CI: 1.45-4.09) in comparison to women who reported no childhood abuse. Conclusions: A history of childhood abuse is associated with increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance and poor sleep quality during pregnancy. These findings, if replicated, should be used to inform the development of trauma-informed care for such sleep disturbances induced by childhood trauma.

N2  - RATIONALE Sleep disordered breathing, particularly multiple sleep arousals or sleep apnea are particularly frequent during late stages of pregnancy in women. Previously, we showed that late gestational sleep fragmentation (SF) induced metabolic dysfunction and deregulation of the metabolic master switch gene Foxo1 in offspring. We hypothesized that SF may affect the higher-order chromatin organization by perturbation in binding of the major higher-order chromatin organization 11-zinc finger CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). CTCF protein homodimers binding to the chromatin may disrupt or facilitate interaction between distal regulatory elements and gene promoters, such as in Foxo1, and alter the levels of gene expression, thereby underlying the metabolic phenotype in SF offspring. METHODS Pregnant mice underwent SF (recurrent awakenings with a customized non-stressful device every 2 min during daylight) from day 14 till day 19 of gestation. The large genomic binding of CTCF was analyzed by Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation - Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) technology in livers from early life (8 week-old) SF-exposed offspring and corresponding sleep control offspring (SC). Gene specific analyses of CTCF binding and expression were confirmed by conventional ChIP and RT-PCR. RESULTS SF during late pregnancy induced differential large genomic binding of the major higher-order chromatin organization protein CTCF (Fig. 1). ChIP-Seq demonstrated that the peaks from both SC and SF-exposed offspring liver samples tend to be shared; however, at least 229 binding sites (p<0.05) of CTCF were differentially bound in SF vs. SC. Application of a gene specific analysis further revealed that the metabolic master switch Foxo1 gene expression and its associated non-coding RNA are regulated by CTCF. ChIP showed increased CTCF binding at Foxo1 gene locus in SF offspring livers compared to SC, suggesting perturbed chromatin organization in SF offspring. CONCLUSIONS Late gestational sleep disturbance in mice induces differential large genomic binding of the major higher-order chromatin organization protein CTCF in offspring livers, suggesting perturbed chromatin organization. This epigenetic abnormality in early life (8 weeks) precedes the observed metabolic syndrome phenotype (20-24 weeks) and may contribute to its development. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background: Sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy and may be influenced by a multitude of factors. Pregnancy, and particularly late gestation, has been associated with a relatively high prevalence of altered sleep patterns including restricted sleep duration, fragmented sleep, snoring, and a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Gestational intermittent hypoxia (GIH), one of the hallmark manifestations of OSA, could impose significant long-term effects on somatic growth, energy homeostasis, and metabolic function in offspring. We hypothesized that GIH during late gestation will lead to increased adiposity and metabolic dysfunction in offspring mice during adulthood. Methods: Time-pregnant female C57BL/6 mice were fed with normal chow and exposed to GIH or room air (RA) conditions. We exposed pregnant mice to GIH for 12 hours during daylight by alternating 21% FIO2 and 6% FIO2, 20 cycles/h for 12 hours/day or to RA during days 13-18 of gestation. After birth, litters were culled to 6 pups, subsequently kept with the mothers for 21 days, and then fed with normal chow (10% fat) for 20 wks. Body weight and food consumption were measured weekly throughout the remainder of the study. At 24 weeks, blood samples were collected from 3-hour fasted offspring mice for lipid profiles and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Results: Body weight, food intake, fasting serum of insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels were all significantly higher in offspring of mothers exposed to GIH when compared to RA-exposed mothers. The adiposity index, which is calculated as the sum of the weight of various fat depots (visceral or epididymal, subcutaneous, perirenal, and mesenteric fats) expressed as a percentage of body weight was also significantly increased in IH mice compared with RA mice. Conclusion: IH during late gestation induces metabolic dysfunction that is associated with increased body weight and adiposity index in male offsprings. This study supports the notion that the presence of IH during late gestation increases the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in the offspring, most likely via epigenetic changes. Perturbations to this environment by OSA during pregnancy can therefore have long-term detrimental effects to the fetus, and lead to persistent metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) which is common during pregnancy may result in reduction in SWS. Studies investigating delta power changes and their associations with SDB are lacking in pregnant population. The study's objectives were to evaluate (1) the association of delta-power with SDB assessed in the first and third trimesters, and (2) investigate whether the amount of change in delta-power is associated with the changes in the severity of SDB. We hypothesized that a greater decrease in delta-power during pregnancy occurs in women with SDB compared to women without SDB and larger increases in AHI will be associated with greater reductions in delta-power. Methods: Data were collected from a completed cohort study of OSA including 127 women in the first (mean age=27.0±7.0yrs) and 103 in the third trimester. All underwent full polysomnography (PSG), and completed Multivariable Apnea Prediction (MAP) index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Sixteen and 27 women in the first and third trimesters, respectively, had AHI≥5. Average spectral profiles were created for each NREM cycle after removing waking and movement epochs and epochs containing micro or miniarousals. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression analysis was used to explore relationships of delta-power with SDB between trimesters. Linear regression examined the associations of delta-power changes with changes in SDB between trimesters. Using delta-power as the outcome variable, degree of SDB as assessed by the AHI and demographic variables with a p<0.2 in bivariate analyses were included in full linear regression model. Results: In bivariate analyses, measures of SDB: AHI, AHI changes, habitual snoring and MAP-apnea symptom score were associated with delta-power at the p <0.2 level. Other variables with p <0.2 included age, race, parity, PSG-sleep efficiency, PSG-total sleep time (TST) and nap frequency. AHI, habitual snoring and MAP apnea symptom score did not show significant associations with delta-power between trimesters after adjusting for age, race, BMI and PSG-TST. In further analysis, AHI change between two trimesters were significantly associated with delta-power change, after adjusting for the covariates (b=-0.02, p=0.024). Conclusions: Women with greater changes in the severity of SDB have greater reduction in delta-power between trimesters. Our study indicates that in the pregnant population, the amount of delta-power may decrease when the severity of SDB increases. Given observations of an association between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes, these results provide the foundation for future longitudinal studies investigating the association of adverse pregnancy outcomes and delta-power changes.

N2  - To evaluate the effects of sleep restriction during pregnancy on maternal care and maternal aggression in a rodent model. Methods: Twenty-three female Wistar rats were assigned to one of two groups: control (n=12) or sleep restriction (n=11) during the entire pregnancy. At the fifth postpartum day, the animals were subjected to the resident-intruder paradigm and to the pup retrieval test. Results: Sleep restriction during pregnancy had no direct effects on maternal care. Regarding aggressive behavior, defensive aggression was increased by sleep loss, with a lower responsiveness threshold to hostile environmental stimuli. Sleep deprivation during gestation also reduced selfgrooming behavior. Conclusion: Taking increased self-grooming as a behavioral correlate of anxiety in rodents, this study provides evidence that lactating dams were in a condition of reduced anxiety. From an adaptive perspective, this pattern of stress response may function to ensure proper maternal behavior, thereby guaranteeing the survival and viability of the litter. Under a translational perspective, the present article confronts the importance of biological and adaptive features to rodent maternal behavior with the relevance of sociocultural factors to the human mother-infant relationship and to the onset of postpartum depression.

N2  - Introduction: Previous studies have demonstrated the benefit of using an incline wedge pillow in patients with nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A positional therapy device (PTD) consisting of a 2-component incline base (9 inches in height) with a lateral positioned body pillow (Medcline, Amenity Health, Inc. San Diego, CA) has recently been shown to decrease nocturnal acid reflux in healthy volunteers. The goal of this study is to determine if the use of an PTD decreases nocturnal symptoms of GERD and improves sleep quality in pregnant women. Methods: This is a single center prospective trial involving pregnant women in their second or third trimester with frequent moderate to severe nocturnal heartburn and regurgitation. Patients completed the Nocturnal GERD Symptom Severity and Impact Questionnaire (N-GSSIQ) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at enrollment. The N-GSSIQ is a validated questionnaire comprised of three parts (Nocturnal GERD Symptoms, Morning Impact of GERD, Concern About Nocturnal GERD). The PSQI is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances, generated from seven component scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. Patients used the PTD every night for 2 weeks and then repeated the N-GSSIQ and the PSQI. Results: A total of 17 pregnant women (age 30.7±4.5 years, pre-pregnancy BMI 27.8±5.9) were recruited from an outpatient obstetrics clinic. Significant improvements in N-GSSIQ total score (52.7 [pre] vs. 18.5 [post], p < 0.001), Nocturnal GERD (32.8 vs. 9.7, p < 0.001), Morning Impact of Nocturnal GERD (6.6 vs. 2.8, p < 0.001) and Concern about Nocturnal GERD (13.5 vs. 6.2, p < 0.001) were noted. A signifi- cant improvement in PSQI global score (10.5 vs. 5.4, p < 0.001) was also noted. No adverse events were reported. Conclusion: In pregnant women with nocturnal heartburn and regurgitation, the PTD significantly reduced nocturnal GERD symptoms, morning impact of nocturnal GERD, concern about nocturnal GERD, and significantly improved overall sleep quality after two weeks of use.

N2  - Introduction/Rationale: Some observational studies suggest that symptoms of maternal sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are associated with the delivery of low birth weight infants. However, prospective studies using objective polysomnographic (PSG) sleep recordings to identify SDB are lacking. Moreover, it is unclear if symptom-based diagnosis of maternal SDB is predictive of PSG results. Methods: As part of a prospective multi-center study investigating maternofetal outcomes in pregnancy (Core Pregnancy Cohort of the Integrated Research Network in Perinatology of Quebec & Eastern Ontario (IRNPQEO)), we recruited a subset of healthy pregnant participants regardless of symptoms to undergo assessment of SDB in the 3rd trimester based on 1) symptoms of SDB from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (frequency of snoring and/or witnessed apneas ≥1x/week); 2) a complete at-home PSG. Small for gestational age (SGA) infants were defined as <10th percentile of Kramer population growth curve. Results: Sleep recording data was available for 230 out of 234 pregnant participants who had completed a 3rd trimester PSG. Subject characteristics and key findings are shown in the Table. Symptoms of SDB occurred in 29%. The prevalence of SDB was 30% using an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) cut-off of 10 events/hour, and 16% using a cut-off of 15 events/hour (Chicago scoring criteria). For subjects with SDB (AHI > 10/h), the mean(±SD) AHI was 18(±10). Maternal age, pre-pregnancy and 3rd trimester BMI, Epworth Score, symptoms of SDB, oxygen desaturation index, arousal index and time spent in flow limitation were all significant for a trend across AHI categories (Table). The sensitivities and specificities of using symptoms to diagnose SDB using an AHI cut-off of 10 events/hour were 56% and 82% respectively, and for a cut-off of 15 events/hour, were 67% and 77%. Delivery of SGA babies in the cohort was 11%. Multiple regression models revealed that neither SDB symptoms nor AHI predicted delivery of a SGA baby, despite adjustment for infant sex, gestational age and ethnicity. Conclusion: The accuracy of SDB diagnosis based on conventional symptoms when compared to PSG was suboptimal in this analysis, suggesting that objective sleep recording is required for reliable identification of SDB among pregnant women. In this cohort of generally non-obese, healthy pregnant women, neither symptom- nor PSG-based maternal SDB diagnosis was associated with delivery of low birth weight infants, though the small number of observed cases limited the strength of our conclusions.

N2  - RATIONALE: Epigenetic processes enable the environment to modulate gene transcription during fetal development, ultimately leading to stable phenotypic changes throughout the lifespan. Late gestational sleep fragmentation (LG-SF), is one of the major perturbations associated with sleep apnea and other sleep disorders during pregnancy. We have previously shown that LG-SF induces metabolic dysfunction in offspring mice during adulthood. We therefore hypothesized that LG-SF increases the propensity for obesity and metabolic dysfunction via epigenomic alterations in metabolically active tissues. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of late LG-SF on metabolic homeostasis in offspring and to determine the effects of LG-SF on the epigenome of visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) in the offspring. METHODS: Time-pregnant mice were exposed to LG-SF or control sleep (LG-SC) conditions during the last 6 days of gestation. Offspring were weaned at 21 days and fed with normal chow diet. Body weight and food consumption were measured weekly. At 24 weeks of age, lipid profiles and metabolic parameters were assessed. In addition, we performed large-scale DNA methylation analyses using MeDIP coupled to microarrays (MeDIP-chip) in VWAT of 24-week-old LG-SF and LG-SC offspring (n=8 mice/group). Univariate multiple-testing adjusted statistical analyses were applied to identify gene promoter regions exhibiting differential DNA methylation (DMRs) between the 2 groups. The candidate regions were then mapped to their corresponding genes, and tested for potential overlaps with biological processes and pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS: Body weight and visceral and subcutaneous fat mass were significantly higher in the LG-SF group. Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides and HOMA-IR values were also significantly higher in the LG-SF group (p<0.001). We detected 2148 DMRs between LG-SF and LG-SC groups (p< 0.0001, two way ANOVA and MAT algorithm). A large proportion of the DMR-associated genes have reported functions that are altered in the metabolic syndrome, such as Cartpt, Akt2, Apoe, Insr1, etc. Among the highest overrepresented canonical pathways and non-directional gene networks we found molecular processes related to metabolic regulation and inflammatory response (i.e. PPARα/RXRα Activation, Protein Ubiquitination Pathway, Glycolysis and Gluconeogenesis, etc.). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a major role for epigenomic regulation of pathways associated to metabolic processes and inflammatory response in VWAT. Furthermore, LG-SF-induced epigenetic alterations appear to increase the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in the offspring.

N2  - Background: OSA is a common sleep disturbance among pregnant women during late gestation, and is characterized by sleep fragmentation (LG-SF), which imposes significant long-term effects on somatic growth, energy homeostasis, and metabolic function in offspring (Khalyfa et al, Diabetes, 2014). Physical activity (PA) is a potential environmental stimulus that can induce long-term modifications of metabolism, particularly at critical periods of post-natal maturation. We hypothesized that PA during early life, but not later during adulthood, would reverse the adverse metabolic phenotype induced by LG-SF. Methods: Time-pregnant female C57BL/6 mice were fed with normal chow and exposed to LG-SF or sleep control (LG-SC) conditions for the last 6 days of gestation. LG-SF was performed for 12 hrs during daylight and consisted of gentle, mechanically-induced arousals at 2-min intervals using a custom automated device. After birth, litters were culled to 6 pups, kept with their dams until weaning at 21 days, and fed with normal chow (10% fat). Mice were divided into 8 groups: LG-SC and LG-SF with and without PA, and early or late. PA was performed for a period of 4 weeks at age 4-8 weeks or 20-24 weeks for 30 minutes/ 3 times per week. Body weight and food consumption were assessed weekly throughout the study, and at 24 weeks metabolic studies were conducted. Results: Body weight, food intake, fasting insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels were all significantly higher in LG-SF compared to LG-SC offspring except for those subjected to early PA. Conclusions: LG-SF induces metabolic dysfunction in offspring that is associated with increased body weight and adiposity index in male offspring. Early, but not late PA abrogates the LG-SF-induced metabolic phenotype in the offspring. Thus, LG-SF, such as in gestational OSA, increases the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome, and early life implementation of regular PA reverses such risk, thereby pointing to a window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention.

N2  - Malaria in pregnancy (MIP) is a serious health risk for the pregnant woman and fetus and associated with mortality in the perinatal period. In Rwanda there has been no accurate national estimate of malaria prevalence among pregnant women. In 2011, a cross-sectional study of 6 districts in 3 malaria transmission zones (low, medium and high) in Rwanda was conducted to estimate the prevalence of peripheral parasitemia in pregnant women. Data were collected from consenting women presenting to antenatal clinics (ANC) for the first time in their current pregnancy including age, parity, gestation, ITN availability and use. Blood was obtained for malaria testing using microscopy, rapid diagnosis tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 4,037 pregnant women were recruited with median age of 27 years, and 3,781 (93.7%) had usable PCR samples. The prevalence of MIP by PCR was 5.6%. Nearly 20% of women's families did not have a net, and 8.7% of these tested positive compared to 4.9% of women whose family owned an ITN. For those who did not sleep under an ITN the previous night, 8.1% tested positive compared with 4.8% who slept under an ITN. Malaria prevalence by parity ranged from 5.5% (parity 0-1), to 5.4% (parity 2-3), and 6.5% (parity 4 or more). The two districts that bordered highly endemic countries had MIP prevalence rates of 10% and above. Those testing positive were treated according to national guidelines. Despite a significant decline of 86% in malaria prevalence in the general population from 2005 to 2011, MIP prevalence remains high, especially in border districts. Our study also showed that ITN ownership and use among these pregnant women is below the national target. In order to address this gap, ITN distribution to achieve universal access, and educational campaign targeted at pregnant women on the use of ITN are recommended. Furthermore, early detection and treatment of MIP at ANC and regional collaboration to reduce crossborder malaria transmission should be prioritized.

N2  - Introduction: Preeclampsia is the most common and dangerous complication of pregnancy with unknown cause. Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress following sleep disorders may cause increased blood pressure. This study was performed with aim to determine the relationship between sleep quality and preeclampsia. Methods: This case-control study was conducted on 15 pregnant women with preeclampsia and 150 healthy women, referred to health centers and academic hospitals of Mashhad city in 2014. Data collection tools included information form related to demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory signs of preeclampsia, depression, anxiety, stress (DAS 21) questionnaire, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Poor sleep quality was defined as a score >5 from PSQI, preeclampsia was defined as systolic blood pressure =140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure =90 mm Hg accompanied with 24 hours urinary protein excretion > 300 mg, or more than + 1 in the strip. Data was analyzed using SPSS software (version 16), and independent t-test, Mann-Whitney, Chi-square test, and logistic regression model. PResults: There was significant relationship between poor sleep quality and preeclampsia (P<0.001), so that, 119 (79.3%) of preeclamptic patients and 91 (60.7%) of healthy cases had poor sleep quality, and risk of preeclampsia in case of poor sleep quality was 2.48 times more (OR=2.48, %95:4.15-1.49). Conclusion: Poor sleep quality is predispose of preeclampsia. Thus, sleep quality screening by pregnancy care providers is recommended.

N2  - Background: During pregnancy, upper airway resistance is increased, predisposing vulnerable women to pregnancy-related OSA. Elevation of the upper body increases upper airway cross-sectional area (CSA) and improves severity of OSA in a subgroup of nonpregnant patients (positional-dependent sleep apnea). We tested the hypothesis that elevated position of the upper body improves OSA early aft er delivery. METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, we conducted a randomized, crossover study on two postpartum units of Massachusetts General Hospital. Women during the first 48 h aft er delivery were included. Polysomnography was performed in nonelevated and 45° elevated upper body position. Upper airway CSA was measured by acoustic pharyngometry in nonelevated, 45° elevated, and sitting body position. Results: Fift y-five patients were enrolled, and measurements of airway CSA obtained. Thirty patients completed polysomnography in both body positions. Elevation of the upper body significantly reduced apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from 7.7 ± 2.2/h in nonelevated to 4.5 ± 1.4/h in 45° elevated upper body position ( P = .031) during sleep. Moderate to severe OSA (AHI . 15/h) was diagnosed in 20% of postpartum patients and successfully treated by elevated body position in one-half of them. Total sleep time and sleep architecture were not affected by upper body elevation. Change from nonelevated to sitting position increased inspiratory upper airway CSA from 1.35 ± 0.1 cm 2 to 1.54 ± 0.1 cm 2 during wakefulness. Positiondependent increase in CSA and decrease in AHI were correlated ( r = 0.42, P = .022). Conclusions: Among early postpartum women, 45° upper body elevation increased upper airway CSA and mitigated sleep apnea. Elevated body position might improve respiratory safety in women early aft er delivery.

N2  - This study examines the relationship among prenatal maternal stress, sleep quality and unplanned Caesarean delivery. For this research, we adopted a prospective survey design and a sample of 200 women in the early stages of labour. The findings were as follows: (i) 11.5% of the participants underwent unplanned Caesarean sections; (ii) based on a Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index split point of 5, approximately 90.5% of the participants experienced poor sleep quality; and (iii) the odds ratio for primiparas undergoing an unplanned Caesarean section was 4.183 times that for multiparas (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.177 to 14.864), indicating a statistically significant difference. The results also showed that stress was a significant factor related to unplanned Caesarean sections; a 1-point increase on the Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale was associated with a 1.033-fold higher probability of undergoing an unplanned Caesarean section (95% CI = 1.002 to 1.065). Furthermore, prenatal stress was a significant variable that can be used to predict unplanned Caesarean deliveries.

N2  - Purpose of review The perinatal period introduces a myriad of changes. One important but often overlooked change is the increased risk for sleep disturbance. Although casually regarded as a consequence of pregnancy or postpartum, there is emerging evidence to suggest that women with significant sleep disturbance, characterized by insomnia symptoms and/or poor sleep quality, are more likely to report an increase in depressive symptomatology or develop postpartum depression (PPD). Significant consequences may arise as a result including issues with maternal infant bonding, effective care for the infant and behavioral or emotional difficulties in the infant. This review discusses the relevant literature as to how disturbed sleep during pregnancy as well as in the postpartum may increase the risk for PPD. Recent findings Symptoms of insomnia and poor sleep quality are independently associated with greater depressive symptoms across pregnancy and throughout postpartum. Likewise, both can negatively impact the ability to mother effectively. Summary The presence of insomnia or sleep disturbance during the perinatal period is a risk factor for depressive symptoms. Women with depression are at an increased risk of developing sleep disturbance thereby increasing depressive symptomatology. This bidirectional and additive relationship needs more clinical attention as both sleep disturbance and depression are noted risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: Deletions of the 4th and 17th chromosomes have previously been described. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has yet to be reported with these deletions. We present clinical and molecular findings in a 18 month-old male with a de novo deletion of 4q34 [46,XY,del(4) (q34)] and an inherited 17q 12 deletion found to have significant obstructive and central sleep apnea. Description: The patient is the second child of non-consanguineous French-Canadian parents. Born at 38weeks gestation by caesarean section, his birth weight was 3040 g, length was 50,5 cm and Apgar scores were 7 at 1 min and 8 at 5 min. His mother was 23 at the time of his birth and is known to have a 17q12 deletion. Clinical findings included micro-retrognathia, craniofacial anomalies and severe psychomotor retardation. Soon after birth he developed severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties as well as frequent hospital admissions secondary to pulmonary aspiration. He also suffered from recurrent infections of the ear and upper respiratory tract. Echocardiography at 1 day documented pulmonary stenosis. A brain MRI, was normal and abdominal ultrasound demonstrated renal cysts. CT scan showed mild aortic coarctation. Video fluoroscopy confirmed inability to handle liquids and severe reflux. During his first admission, he developed SDB, with both obstructive (OSA) and central sleep apnea. This was characterized by snoring and respiratory pauses. Polysomnography revealed a respiratory disturbance index of 10 events per hour consisting of both central and obstructive types. Overnight studies demonstrated significant hypoventilation and desaturations. Cardiorespiratory monitoring confirmed significant central events. A C02 ventilation response showed minimal response to hypercapnea. Fox 2B was negative. Non-invasive ventilation was attempted unsuccessfully. He was then placed on supplemental oxygen. Discussion:SDB in children with 4q34 or 17q12 deletion syndrome has not yet been reported. Our patient experienced OSA, likely due to micro-retrognathia in conjunction with her elevated tongue base and pharyngeal hypotonia. We could not explain the central apneic events. The clinical findings associated with deletions involving the 4q34 region are reminiscent of the 22q11 deletion phenotype and may explain some of the sleep findings in this patient, while 17q12 deletions have been associated with recurrent respiratory infections. In conclusion we suggest a thorough sleep history in all patients with 4q34 or 17q12 deletion syndrome in order to better define respiratory findings in these patients. In addition, thorough genetic evaluation should be considered in all patients with unexplained SDB.

N2  - Introduction: There are few studies in preterm newborn nocturnal sleep. Our goal was to describe the nocturnal sleep architecture and respiratory events associated, like apnea and oxygen saturation in newborn less than 3 months postnatal life. Material and method: 30 newborn ≤ 37 gestation weeks, post-conceptional age ≤ 3 months, not hospitalized, were selected. Through 8 hours nocturnal sleep polisomnographic study they were rated. Results: The gestation weeks median was 34 ± 1.5, the age was 43.5 ± 25.5 at the time of study. The quiet sleep total time was greater than the active sleep total time (Wilcoxon p = 0.411). The central apnea index in active sleep total time (76.2 ± 53.4) was greater than quiet sleep total time (33.6 ± 31.7) Wilcoxon p = 0.026. SaO2 average median was 93.5%. The 27% of sleep total time we registered intermittent hypoxemia. Conclusions: The presence of intermittent hypoxemia in preterm newborn is a risk condition to cognitive and physical development. Sleeping intermittent hypoxemia early diagnosis and treatment is very important.

N2  - Introduction: The rupturing of a brain aneurysm hardly ever happens during pregnancy and can be easily confused with preeclampsia/eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia are frequent events during pregnancy, and one of the most common symptoms is headache, which can be associated with high blood pressure. This case shows why it is so important to take into account different diagnoses in face of headache during hypertensive pregnancy. Clinical case 38-year old female, 38w5d pregnant, with essential AHT, treated with nifedipine CR 30mg, who turned to the ER due to a faint spell followed by occipital headache and vomiting. BP was 143/95 mmHg and urine test strip showed moderate proteinuria, wherefore an analytical analysis was conducted, but did not reveal any changes. The patient was hospitalised as pre-eclampsia was suspected. During the following 8 hours, as the headaches, vomiting and changes in awareness (sleep-wake) did not pass, the patient was referred to Neurology. Neurological examination did not show focal deficit. Cranialcephalic MRI was performed, showing subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), hydrocephalus of the supratentorial ventricular system, with haemorrhagic and ischemic areas, probably demonstrating ruptured aneurysm (confirmed by angio-MRI: cerebral aneurysm of the right middle artery). The patient underwent emergency cesarean, and aneurysm clip immediately afterwards. The patient remained in the hospital for 28 days and was discharged without neurological deficitS. The newborn is healthy. Discussion Rupture of a cerebral aneurysm during pregnancy is a rare yet serious complication, with a high rate of maternal morbimortality and is a challenge for obstetricians, neurosurgeons and anesthesiologists. Transitory hypertension and proteinuria are not rare in SAH. The high degree of suspicion lead to early diagnosis and quick management of the event, which resulted in a positive outcome.

N2  - Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy [SUDI], is the biggest single component of post neonatal death in the developed world. Unfortunately, like many indigenous groups, Maori have increased risk of SUDI. The wahakura is a sleep device developed by Maori as an alternative to direct bedsharing, but as yet is untested. Aim: to compare the overnight oxygen saturation and thermal environment of infants in a wahakura and standard bassinet as part of a large study to identify dangers (bedsharing, infant sleep position, hypoxia and hyperthermia), and potential benefits (breastfeeding promotion) of the wahakura. Methods: 200 mainly Maori participants were recruited through midwifery practices in deprived areas, and randomized to receive a wahakura (W) or a bassinet (B) during pregnancy for use from birth. A 1 month infant sleep study with “usual sleep device” included infrared video, infant SaO2, and peripheral and environmental temperature. Episodes of SaO2 < 94% and <90%, time in a cool state (shin temp < 34o) or warm state (shin temp > 36o) and room and outside temperatures were compared for the groups. Results: SaO2 was analysed by intention to treat for 83B and 84W infants. Median minutes <94% (B: 1.99; W: 1.91) and <90% (0.75; 0.74) were similar as were number of dips of 5%SaO2/hr (8.57; 10.88, p = 0.9) and dips of 10%/hr (1.65; 2.45, p = 0.5). As treated analysis for 105 infants in a bassinet or cot (BC), 47 in a wahakura (W) and 13 in an adult's bed (AB) also indicated equivalence across the groups for these measures of SaO2. Overnight mean shin, room and outside temperatures were not different between the randomised groups nor were median infant cool times [B: 54.5 min (IQR 28, 150) vs W 66 min (26,147]. 75% of infants in both groups had no warm time (shin > 35o). Only 18B and 14W infants had any warm time (mean: 97 min, 73 min). As treated analysis compared 94BC, 39W and 11AB infants and similarly did not show a difference between groups for time in a cool or warm state. Conclusion: Preliminary results indicate equivalence for overnight SaO2 between the wahakura and bassinet and for overnight infant temperature, thus supporting our findings from video and questionnaires to suggest the wahakura is at least equivalent to the currently recommended bassinet as an option for parents who may otherwise bedshare.

N2  - AIMS: Nausea, vomiting and fatigue are the most common pregnancy- related symptoms in early pregnancy and they may affect women's health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The aim of this study was to assess the independent associations between these symptoms and HRQOL of women during first trimester in a community sample. METHODS: We included 5079 women in early pregnancy in the Generation R Study, a prospective mother and child cohort study. The frequency of nausea, vomiting and fatigue in the last 3 months was measured by questionnaire at enrollment. The 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) was used to measure HRQOL; physical and mental component summary (PCS/MCS) scores were calculated. We considered demographic characteristics (maternal/gestational age, ethnic background, education level, marital status, parity), life-style related factors (body mass index, tobacco and alcohol use), indicators of health status (chronic/infectious conditions, urogenital symptoms, sleep quality, headache, anxiety, and depression) as potential confounders, which were also measured by questionnaire. Independent associations of nausea, vomiting and fatigue with HRQOL were assessed using multivariate regression models adjusting for all potential confounders. Multiple imputation was applied to account for missing data in covariates. RESULTS: Mean age was 30.0 (SD 5.0) years; mean gestational age was 13.5 (SD 2.0) weeks; 44.1 % were non-Dutch. Percentages of women who reported nausea, vomiting and fatigue to be present daily in the last 3 months were 33.6, 9.6 and 44.4 %, respectively; 17.1, 56.6 and 2.0 % reported no nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that compared to women who never reported these symptoms, those who reported nausea, vomiting and fatigue to be presented daily had decreased HRQOL in both PCS (respectively -3.0, 95 % CI -3.8, -2.2; -2.1, 95 % CI -3.1, -1.2; -5.2, 95 % CI -6.9, -3.5) and MCS (-1.8, 95 % CI -2.7, -0.96; -3.0, 95 % CI -4.0, -2.0; -3.0, 95 % CI -4.8, -1.1), after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Even after adjusting for a comprehensive set of potential confounders, presence of nausea, vomiting and fatigue are associated with lower HRQOL. These findings highlight the importance to take into account negative impacts of pregnancy-related symptoms on HRQOL by health professionals in daily practice. Further research should focus on evaluation of approaches to improve HRQOL during early pregnancy.

N2  - One-quarter of neonatal deaths are attributable to infections. Observational data suggest that maternal handwashing with soap prevents neonatal mortality but maternal handwashing is difficult to increase in the neonatal period. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the impact of a chlorhexidine-based waterless hand cleansing promotion on behavior of mothers and other household members. In a demographic surveillance area in Bangladesh, we randomized consenting pregnant women at 32-34 weeks gestation to intervention or control. In the intervention arm, behavior change communicators promoted chlorhexidine hand cleansing to pregnant women and their household members, and provided a bottle of 4% chlorhexidine lotion. Using data from structured observations, we compared hand cleansing with chlorhexidine or handwashing with soap before baby care among mothers and household members in the intervention arm to those in the control. Chlorhexidine was observed in the baby's sleep space in 97% of 130 intervention homes, compared to soap in 59% of 128 control homes. Hand cleansing before baby care was observed 5.6 times more frequently among mothers in the intervention arm, compared to controls (95% CI 4.0 - 7.7). Hand cleansing was observed at 34% of baby care events among women other than the mother in the intervention arm and 3% in the control arm (RR 10.9, 95% CI 5.1 - 23.1). Girls in the intervention arm cleansed hands before baby contact 37.0 times more frequently than those in the control arm (95% CI 5.2 - 263.7). Men and boys in the intervention cleansed hands before 29% and 44% of baby care events, compared to 0% for each in the control arm. A waterless hand cleansing option using chlorhexidine resulted in substantial increases in hand cleansing behavior among mothers who have greatest contact with neonates. Other household members, particularly children who may introduce new organisms to the neonate's environment, had far greater increases in hand cleansing in the intervention arm than mothers. The impact of chlorhexidine hand cleansing among mothers and other household members on neonatal infections should be evaluated.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with adverse maternal and fetal complications. Its recognition in early pregnancy may have important implications. Most studies have focused on comparisons among the existing tools and ranked these tools in terms of predictability indices including AUC, specificity, sensitivity and others. This study aims to demonstrate the potential value of combining existing tools as an alternative for a more effective method to predict gestational OSA. Methods: Data were collected from a completed cohort of 123 women in the first trimester. Subjects underwent full polysomnography, completed Multivariable Apnea Prediction index (MAPI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and had OSAHS Score (sum of Mallampati score, body mass index [BMI] categories and tonsil size). The presence of OSA was defined by AHI ≥ 5 events per hour. Prediction models for gestational OSA were investigated using factor analysis, logistic regression and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analyses. A backwards stepwise multivariable logistic regression was used to determine which combination of measures best predicts OSA risk (AHI ≥5). Factor score estimation, logistic regression analyses and CART analyses were based on 5 measurements: MAPI-apnea symptom score, ESS, PSQI-global, osahs score and Facco's apnea prediction rule of high-risk pregnancy. Results: Mean age was 27±6.93. Twelve women had AHI≥5. The factor analysis generated a model with AUC which is 0.78 (95% CI: 0.64-0.92). The model generated by the logistic regression had AUC= 0.78 (95% CI: 0.62-0.94). The regression model using only Facco rule as a predictor also showed AUC as 0.80 (95% CI: 0.67-0.94). However, the AUC of the CART including MAP-apnea symptom score, Facco's rule and ESS (figure 1) was 0.89 (0.77-1.00) higher than AUCs of both Facco's rule alone and also of the model generated by the logistic regression. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the models generated by logistic regression and factor analysis could be useful to identity gestational OSA, but the model generated by CART has the potential values to predict gestational OSA better. Additionally the graphical presentation of the CART simplifies the interpretation of the results.

N2  - Objectives: Massage therapy is a common complementary treatment method widely used around the world. In references of traditional medicine, Iranian scholars refer to massage therapy as “Dalak”, associating this method with advantages such as ridding the body of voyeur and increasing visceral heat. This study aimed to compare the functions of massage therapy between Iranian traditional medicine and modern medicine. Materials and Methods: This study was performed via reviewing the literature of Iranian traditional medicine about the applications of massage therapy. In addition, functions of massage therapy in modern medicine were searched in electrical databases, and the results were compared between these two sources. Results: In the Iranian traditional medicine, massage therapy was commonly used for the treatment of persistent headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, nightmares, shivering, numbness of limbs, loss of appetite, excessive weight loss, poor digestion, joint pains and shortness of breath. As for modern medicine, the most frequent applications of massage therapy were to reduce chronic pains, labor pain and delivery time in pregnant women, anxiety, sleep disorders, improving growth in children, as well as the treatment of neonatal jaundice, apnea, colic, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome and hypertension. Conclusion: According to the results of this study and former clinical trials about massage therapy, this method is commonly used for the treatment of chronic pains, headaches, insomnia and improving the growth of body organs. However, in cases such as the treatment of shivering and loss of appetite, which have been mentioned in the manuscripts of Iranian traditional medicine, no clinical trials have been conducted in modern medicine. Therefore, it is recommended that more clinical trials be performed as to discover other clinical applications of massage therapy in the Iranian traditional medicine.

N2  - Objective To identify risk factors for urinary incontinence (UI) and assess the quality of life (QoL) of affected women. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted of all women with UI who attended the urology and gynecology services of four hospitals in central Portugal between March and December 2012. Information was obtained from participants using questionnaires assessing sociodemographic, obstetric, gynecologic, and lifestyle variables. Results Among 505 participants, 351 (69.5%) had urgency UI, 107 (21.2%) stress UI, and 47 (9.3%) mixed UI. Stress UI was associated with smoking, alcohol consumption, constipation, gravidity, parity, and vaginal infections (P ≤ 0.02 for all). Urgency UI was associated with age above 50 years, employment, smoking, and sitting for 2 hours or less per day (P ≤ 0.02 for all). Mixed UI was associated with age 50 years or younger, smoking, sitting for 2 hours or less per day, and frequently carrying more than 3 kg in weight (P < 0.001 for all). A negative impact on QoL was reported by 501 (99.2%) women. Compared with younger participants, women older than 50 years presented with more sleep/energy disturbances and performance limitations (P ≤ 0.04 for both). Conclusion UI is associated with several risk factors and has a negative impact on QoL. Appropriate investigation regarding the factors associated with the types of UI should be performed to diminish its impact on QoL.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the transfer of 2-Naphthol (NPH) in fullterm human placental tissues using the ex vivo human perfusion model. Method: A total of six placentas were obtained from women undergoing elective Caesarean section or vaginal delivery at term. Schneider's ex vivo human placental perfusion model was adopted. The perfusate at fetal side was circulated at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The flow at maternal intervillous space was at a rate of 12 ml/min. After equilibration, the perfusate in the maternal compartment was replaced with fresh perfusate containing 2-NPH at 100ug/mL, antipyrine at 50 mg/mL. Samples were obtained from the maternal and fetal circulations at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 360 minutes. Results: A total of 6 term placentas were perfused. The mean weight of the perfused cotyledon was 26.3 (± 5.5) grams. The fluid shift between the fetal and maternal compartments was <3ml/h. All pre-perfused placental samples contained 2-Naphthol (NPH) in their tissues with a mean NPH level of 7.98 (± 1.73) ug\g compared to a mean of 15.58 (± 4.53) ug\g after 360 minutes perfusion. NPH showed rapid drop in the maternal compartment. It dropped 5.54 ug\g in the first 15 minutes and 13.8 ug\g in 360 minutes. However, the increase of NPH concentration on the fetal side was much slower. Conclusions: Pregnant women seem to be exposed to high levels of environmental NAP. Its metabolites, NPH, and accumulates in term placentas. NPH has the ability to rapidly cross the placenta from the maternal to the fetal compartment within 15 minutes. The placenta seems to play a role in limiting the passage of NPH in the fetal compartment.

N2  - Objectives: To understand women's concerns regarding labour and delivery and their views regarding the acceptability of using a maternity waiting home to avoid difficult journeys in labour. Method: In September 2013, thirty three pregnant women seen in five antenatal outreach clinics in rural SW Uganda agreed to take part in semi-structured interviews in which their concerns regarding birth, and their views regarding using a new maternity waiting home which had been opened on the hospital site were exploerd. The interviews were translated contemporaneously and transcribed for coding. Thematic analysis of the coded transcripts was undertaken using a framework approach. Results: Women's expressed a variety of concerns. All women interviewed were positive about the maternity waiting home and several made suggestions which were later adopted. For example, a night watchwoman was employed to provide security, and one female attendant was permitted to sleep in the home with each women if they wished. This represented a change from the original plans, in response to the women's wishes. Conclusions: Women in this remote rural community expressed numerous concerns regarding delivery, ranging from fears of stillbirth to haemorrhage, often based upon their own past experiences or those of family or friends. They welcomed the provision of a maternity waiting home in the local hospital and expressed interest in using the facility. They were able to make constructive suggestions which should improve the acceptability of a stay in the home. An audit of usage of the home and user outcomes is ongoing. A stay in a maternity waiting home is an acceptable risk reductionstrategy for women in rural SW Uganda.

N2  - The neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a common problem in clinical practice, the most frequent symptomatology has been described in neonates with intrauterine exposition to drugs of abuse, especially opoids, although, consumer habits are being modified significantly over the last few years. Likewise, this implies longer hospital stays. The aim of this review is to know the magnitude of NAS from January 2005 to December 2014 related to another serie of cases between 2001 and 2004 in our hospital. We compared the number of cases, severity, duration of symptoms and comorbidity in both groups. Design: Retrospective analysis of data collected from the new-borns admitted to Valme Hospital with NAS diagnosis. Results: 36 neonates with the risk of NAS were admitted. Mother blood serology during pregnancy was negative in 47.2%, unknown in 11.1%, HCV positive in 30.5% (of which 8.5% were HIV/ syphilis), 8.3% HIV or 2.3% toxoplasm. In respect to type of birth; 66.6% were eutocic, 16.6% instrumentalized, 8.3% caesarean due to maternal pathology and 8.3% because of fetal problems. In relation to prenatal pathology, 47.2% showed no prenatal pathology associated, 11.1% IUGR, 11.1% late preterm birth and 30.5% showed a different prenatal pathology (oligoamnios, micro or macrocephaly, CMV infection, syphilis). In relation with the type of drugs consumed by mothers: 80.5% methadone (of which 62% also consumed other substances such us cocaine and cannabis), 16.6% benzodiazepines and other CNS drugs while 2.7% morphine and cocaine. The average hospital stay was 18.1 days. The average starting time of symptomatology was 34 hours after birth while the average duration of symptoms was 14.4 days and average time for use phenobarbital was 11.3 days. The Finnegan scale was used to assess symptoms, of which the most common symptoms were sleep disorders, hypertonia and tremor. Other common social problem associated consisted in psychiatric pathology and living in a prison. Conclusion: The number of mothers with HIV positive serology has decreased, although the percentage of HCV positive mothers remains high. The number of caesarean interventions has decreased while the number of eutocic births has increased. The associated prenatal pathology was varied; it should be the objective of another study to know the posterior importance of exposition to drugs during pregnancy. Methadone was the highest consumed drug, observing an increase in multiple drug addiction. The hospital stay, the average duration of symptoms and the time for using Phenobarbital were similar.

N2  - Introduction: Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in PHOX2B gene. CCHS is often diagnosed in the neonatal period by alveolar hypoventilation with variable complications such as Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), arrhythmia, profuse sweating, which is associated with a broad spectrum of autonomic nervous system dysfunctions. Case: We report a 6-month-old female patient with CCHS complicated by hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH). She was born by cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. Birth weight was 2549g. APGAR score was 6 and 9 (at 1 and 5 minutes). Although there were no maternal infections, hydramnion was observed from 31 weeks of gestation. Postnatally, she was intubated due to respiratory disorder. Following extubation, repetitive episodes of apnea were observed. In addition, abdominal distention appeared after birth. On day 4, the patient received colostomy due to the above gastrointestinal symptoms and was diagnosed with HSCR by colonic biopsy. Due to the presence of HSCR with the continuous requirement of ventilation support during sleep, the diagnosis of CCHS was suspected, and officially confirmed by genetic testing at 1 month of age. A heterozygous 27-polyalanine repeat expansion mutation in the PHOX2B gene was confirmed. The first episode of hypoglycemia was detected by a new-onset seizure at 6 months of age. The lowest blood glucose level was 15mg/dl with high serum insulin level of 3.0μg/ml. After this episode, we continued to monitor blood glucose and diagnosed this case as HH on the basis of recurrent hypoglycemic episodes and simultaneous hyperinsulinemia. After the diagnosis, we started the treatment of HH with diazoxide and stabilized the serum glucose level. Discussion: We are only aware of 7 cases previously reported with CCHS along with HH in the world. Among the 7 cases reported, HH occurred in 6 of them with symptoms starting by the age of 1. In 2 cases, the first symptom was seizures caused by HH, just as in our case. Regarding treatment of HH, “Diazoxide” a potassium channel activator was effective in 5 cases. The glycemic dysregulation is an additional clinical feature of CCHS, but still is unrecognized and underestimated. Conclusion: We report a case of an infant with CCHS complicated by HH. In the event of patients with CCHS complicated with seizures, consideration of HH should be given. Hypoglycemia can cause serious neurocognitive sequelae, therefore early recognition and monitoring of glucose is important for the patients with CCHS.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of home care practices in very to moderately preterm (VPT), late preterm (LPT) and term infants born in Massachusetts. Study Design: Using 2007 to 2010 Massachusetts Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data, births were categorized by gestational age (VPT: 23 to 33 weeks; LPT: 34 to 36 weeks; term: 37 to 42 weeks). Home care practices included breastfeeding initiation and continuation, and infant sleep practices (supine sleep position, sleeping in a crib, cosleeping in an adult bed). We developed multivariate models to examine the association of infant sleep practices and breastfeeding with preterm status, controlling for maternal sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Supine sleep position was more prevalent among term infants compared with VPT and LPT infants (77.1%, 71.5%, 64.4%; P=0.02). In the adjusted model, LPT infants were less likely to be placed in supine sleep position compared with term infants (adjusted prevalence ratio=0.86; 95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 0.97). Breastfeeding initiation and continuation did not differ among preterm and term groups. Nearly 16% of VPT and 18% of LPT and term infants were not sleeping in cribs and 14% of LPT and term infants were cosleeping on an adult bed. Conclusion: Compared with term infants, LPT infants were less likely to be placed in supine sleep position after hospital discharge. A significant percent of preterm and term infants were cosleeping on an adult bed. Hospitals may consider improving their safe sleep education, particularly to mothers of LPT infants.

N2  - Children who experienced intrauterinegrowthrestriction (IUGR) may be at increased risk for adverse developmental outcomes in early childhood. Impaired neurodevelopmental outcome is a major long-term complication of surviving low birth weigth infants, especially motor and neurosensory deficits occur frequently, are often severe, including cerebral palsy, and persist into school age and young adulthood. Term infants presenting with IUGR) lower ratios than controls of the same age intelligence, and as plots most affected areas of language development, working memory, problem solving visuospatial, etc. However, we are not aware of assessments neurological birth they could alert us about the future of these children. We work with the hypothesis that IUGR infants presented abnormalities in the neonatal period in brain development as a result of adverse intrauterine conditions. We aimed to examine the association between IUGR documented in utero, and earliest neurodevelopmental abnormalities. The analysis included fetus that identified IUGRin utero and normal normal pregnancies. We evaluate whether there maturational abnormalities or chronic brain injury records videoelectroencephalography (EEG) by visual analysis in the first days of life. This was a prospective observational study including 17 Term infants with IUGR (Pc< 10)and 22 term infants “healthy” (non IUGR). Both groups were checked by fetal ultrasound (fetal growth estimation and Doppler ultrasound in umbilical artery, middle cerebral artery and placenta brain ratio). To all of them we performed a Video-EEG recording of at least 90 minutes to include a waking dream full cycle. Are maturation analyzed EEG patterns (percentages of discontinuity, indeterminate sleep, bursts with delta brushes, frontal encoches and number of bursts of rolandic alpha/theta activity) and chronic CNS injury patterns (number of transient sharp waves per hour, percentage of asynchrony and asymmetry). Comparisons between group of quantitative variables were performed with the Mann Whitney. Conclusions: Both groups of children were well established cycles of waking dream. The infants with IUGR presented: 1) a higher percentage of discontinuous path (p <0.001) and saved with brushes delta (p <0.007); 2) a lower number of bursts of alpha / theta Rolandic (p <0.001) activity; 3) A higher percentage of asymmetry (p <0.027) and asynchronous (p <0.018). They were not found significant differences in the remaining parameters. The IUGR Infants have important differences in EEG trace background regarding infants not IUGR term. These differences are both developmental delay as EEGs chronic abnormalities. It would be warranted larger study and monitoring Strait postnatal facing these children early intervention.

N2  - Traumatic ribs fractures achieve related-pain hypoventilation and mismatch. Contention of injured chest wall enhance breathes. Internal pneumatic contention (after elimination or treatment of pneumothoraces) through PEP application is validated. Aim: Because CPAP home-devices are relevant to maintain high continuous levels of PEP, associated with low noises, humidifiers, able to associate O2, we conduct an observational study to validate a Continuous-PAP therapy from the Emergency department through Intensive then Intermediate then medicine then home in terms of ability to deliver painless and oxygenative PEP and capability by naïve medical and nurse's crew Methods: All adult patients admitted for domestic chest trauma with ribs injury included. Exclusions: Respiratory distress, multi-trauma, pregnancy, confusion, facial injury, hypercapnic COPD∗, work's incident). Chest wall was CT-scan defined. Pneumothorax wer treated through intercostal aspirative chest-tube drainage O2 supplementation achieved SpO2 up than 94% was added to the NIV. Chest pain was Analogic Visual Scale (AVS)-documented and neofam plus acetaminophen plus morphinic-agonists were used. No NSAIAs were authorized. Self-and medical use of Continuous-PAP device were evaluated through self-questionnaires and VAS [i.e. self-using, comfort, etc.,]. Capability were evaluated by medical staff [i.e. completion, understanding, etc.]. Pressures were set in regards of tolerance and efficacy on chest movements and capability to decrease paradoxal ventilation (5 minutes delay ramp). Result (mean, SD, NS = p> 0.05): 20 consecutive chest trauma with ribs fractures: 16 men, paradoxal spontaneous ventilation 6 cases, 67.8 ± 8.4 year-old, BMI 26.6 ± 5.4 kg/m2, PaO2 65.3 ± 1.9 mmHg Room Air at Emergency Room, Mean SpO2 during NIV : 96.3 ± 1,8% verses 95.8 +/- 1.5 (NS) during SV-O2. O2 flows to achieving the objective of SpO2 (94%) were differents: 2 l/min if CPAP verses 5,0 + 1,5 if SV. Self-evaluation (modified VAS) of efficacy of their first NIV's night: 7.6 ± 1.5/10 versus 4.6 ± 3.0/10 (during NIV withdrawal). Duration of NIV 16.5± 3,6 hr during the first 3 days, 8.5 ± 4.3 during the first 2 weeks at home (provider's reporting). Two epidural thoracic analgesia procedures were required because of AVS > 4 despite antalgic protocol and NIV, and all two in paradoxal breathes (2/6). No adverse effects (skin lesion, hypotension, pneumothoraces). Conclusion: Sleep designed CPAP are able to content chest wall achieving pain and oxygenation controls and low hospitalization duration. The home time duration of CPAP was less than 3 weeks. Self-cessation was the huge way of withdrawal. No prior educational programs seems.

N2  - Background In 2008, a cochrane review was published about evidence based operation methods for caesarean section. The Joel-Cohen-based technique should be recommended due to less fever, pain and analgetic requirements, less blood loss, shorther surgery and hospital stay. However, information on longterm morbidity as adherent placenta or scar rupture were not included. An increase in ectopic pregnancies in the casarean scar have been published, and longterm problems with niche (isthmocele) have been described. We have experienced an increase in young women with chronic pain starting shortly after caesarean section, often repeated or emergency, with severe adherences between the uterus, bladder and the abdominal wall. Methods To diagnose adherences is difficult: We have seen 10 consecutive young women having urinary problems with little volumens, pain after training sessions using the abdominal rectus and obliques muscles, and dyspareunia. They often have daily pain in the postoperative period after the caesarean, but the pain never entirely disappear. Some are discovered years after the caesarean, as some pains after surgery in generally have been anticipated. At the gynecological examination, we have suspicion of adherencies when the the cervix is not easy to find, overwhelmingly well suspended up behind the pubic bone, and uterus is fixated to the abdominal wall. At the ultrasound, uterus is bended, with the niche at the former uterotomi fixated to the bladder. Sometimes the bladder is trapped down in the niche as well, and a echogenic area is seen were the adherences are from the front of the uterus to the bladder/abdominal wall. Results We would like to present a video (3 minutes and 24 secunds) showing the laparoscopic adhesiolysis, with use of hemostatic and anti-adhesiolytic medical devices, in a patient with an initial bladder volume of 70ml at urogynecologic examinations. We performed the laparoscopic adhesiolyses after 10 month with thorough urogynecological examinations, 5 years after the caesarean. One year postoperatively she is still having normal voiding with normal volumes and sleep through the night. Conclusions First, further studies on long term complications after caesarean section might be warranted, and we have initiated a longterm registry study on longterm complications after casarean section and hysterectomy. Second, we would like gynecologists to be aware of these possible long term pain and voiding problems after caesarean. Third, it should be acknowledged that adherences emerged after laparotomi, might be corrected by laparoscopy using hemostatic and antiadhesiolytic medical devices with pain relief as result.

N2  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem inflammatory disorder that occurs primarily in women of childbearing age, immunologic abnormalities being a prominent feature of the disease. Psychiatric disorders frequently coexist, depression being the most common mood disorder in neuropsychiatric lupus. This literature review was performed through searching MEDLINE database for full-text English-language articles--original research, systematic review and updates published in the last five years (2010-2015), using the keywords "depression and systemic lupus erythematosus". The main outcomes identified were prevalence and predictors of depression in various cultural and ethnic groups, depression-related clinical issues (suicidal ideation, cognitive impairment, altered body image, sleep and sexual disturbances, influence of SLE treatment), and influence on quality of life. A multidisciplinary approach that takes into account the polymorphism and individual variability of the SLE clinical manifestations helps to improve early detection of depression, which is responsible for the increased risk of comorbidities, suicidal attempts, decreased treatment adherence, and impaired quality of life. Physicians across all specialties involved in the care for lupus patients should be aware of the major prevalence of this condition, while helping patients to cope with their disabling disease.

N2  - Background: More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low-back pain and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. The two conditions may occur separately or together (low-back and pelvic pain) and typically increase with advancing pregnancy, interfering with work, daily activities and sleep. Objectives: To update the evidence assessing the effects of any intervention used to prevent and treat low-back pain, pelvic pain or both during pregnancy. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth (to 19 January 2015), and the Cochrane Back Review Groups' (to 19 January 2015) Trials Registers, identified relevant studies and reviews and checked their reference lists. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment, or combination of treatments, to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of low-back pain, pelvic pain or both, related functional disability, sick leave and adverse effects during pregnancy. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Main results: We included 34 RCTs examining 5121 pregnant women, aged 16 to 45 years and, when reported, from 12 to 38 weeks' gestation. Fifteen RCTs examined women with low-back pain (participants = 1847); six examined pelvic pain (participants = 889); and 13 examined women with both low-back and pelvic pain (participants = 2385). Two studies also investigated low-back pain prevention and four, low-back and pelvic pain prevention. Diagnoses ranged from self-reported symptoms to clinicians' interpretation of specific tests. All interventions were added to usual prenatal care and, unless noted, were compared with usual prenatal care. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low, raising concerns about the confidence we could put in the estimates of effect. For low-back pain Results from meta-analyses provided low-quality evidence (study design limitations, inconsistency) that any land-based exercise significantly reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.03 to -0.25; participants = 645; studies = seven) and functional disability (SMD -0.56; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23; participants = 146; studies = two). Low-quality evidence (study design limitations, imprecision) also suggested no significant differences in the number of women reporting low-back pain between group exercise, added to information about managing pain, versus usual prenatal care (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.17; participants = 374; studies = two). For pelvic pain Results from a meta-analysis provided low-quality evidence (study design limitations, imprecision) of no significant difference in the number of women reporting pelvic pain between group exercise, added to information about managing pain, and usual prenatal care (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; participants = 374; studies = two). For low-back and pelvic pain Results from meta-analyses provided moderate-quality evidence (study design limitations) that: an eight- to 12-week exercise program reduced the number of women who reported low-back and pelvic pain (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; participants = 1176; studies = four); land-based exercise, in a variety of formats, significantly reduced low-back and pelvic pain-related sick leave (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; participants = 1062; studies = two). The results from a number of individual studies, incorporating various other interventions, could not be pooled due to clinical heterogeneity. There was moderate-quality evidence (study design limitations or imprecision) from individual studies suggesting that osteomanipulative therapy significantly reduced low-back pain and functional disability, and acupuncture or craniosacral therapy improved pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care. Evidence from individual studies was largely of low quality (study design limitations, imprecision), and suggested that pain and functional disability, but not sick leave, were significantly reduced following a multi-modal intervention (manual therapy, exercise and education) for low-back and pelvic pain. When reported, adverse effects were minor and transient. Authors' conclusions: There is low-quality evidence that exercise (any exercise on land or in water), may reduce pregnancy-related low-back pain and moderate- to low-quality evidence suggesting that any exercise improves functional disability and reduces sick leave more than usual prenatal care. Evidence from single studies suggests that acupuncture or craniosacral therapy improves pregnancy-related pelvic pain, and osteomanipulative therapy or a multi-modal intervention (manual therapy, exercise and education) may also be of benefit. Clinical heterogeneity precluded pooling of results in many cases. Statistical heterogeneity was substantial in all but three meta-analyses, which did not improve following sensitivity analyses. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be ruled out. Further evidence is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and change the estimates. Studies would benefit from the introduction of an agreed classification system that can be used to categorise women according to their presenting symptoms, so that treatment can be tailored accordingly.

N2  - A range of important early-life predictors of later obesity have been identified. Children of lower socioeconomic position (SEP) have a steeper weight gain trajectory from birth with a strong socioeconomic gradient in child and adult obesity prevalence. An assessment of the association between SEP and the early-life predictors of obesity has been lacking. The review involved a two-stage process: Part 1, using previously published systematic reviews, we developed a list of the potentially modifiable determinants of obesity observable in the pre-natal, peri-natal or post-natal (pre-school) periods; and part 2, conducting a literature review of evidence for socioeconomic patterning in the determinants identified in part 1. Strong evidence was found for an inverse relationship between SEP and (1) pre-natal risk factors (pre-pregnancy maternal body mass index (BMI), diabetes and pre-pregnancy diet), (2) antenatal/peri natal risk factors (smoking during pregnancy and low birth weight) and (3) early-life nutrition (including breastfeeding initiation and duration, early introduction of solids, maternal and infant diet quality, and some aspects of the home food environment), and television viewing in young children. Less strong evidence (because of a lack of studies for some factors) was found for paternal BMI, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, child sleep duration, high birth weight and lack of physical activity in young children. A strong socioeconomic gradient exists for the majority of the early-life predictors of obesity suggesting that the die is cast very early in life (even pre-conception). Lifestyle interventions targeting disadvantaged women at or before child-bearing age may therefore be particularly important in reducing inequality. Given the likely challenges of reaching this target population, it may be that during pregnancy and their child’s early years are more feasible windows for engagement.

N2  - Background: Heartburn is one of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in pregnant women. It can occur in all trimesters of pregnancy. The symptoms of heartburn in pregnancy may be frequent, severe and distressing, but serious complications are rare. Many interventions have been used for the treatment of heartburn in pregnancy. These interventions include advice on diet, lifestyle modification and medications. However, there has been no evidence-based recommendation for the treatment of heartburn in pregnancy. Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions for relieving heartburn in pregnancy. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov (2 March 2015), Asian & Oceanic Congress of Obstetrics & Gynaecology (AOCOG) conference proceedings (20-23 October 2013, Centara Grand & Bangkok Convention Centre, Bangkok, Thailand), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTS of interventions for heartburn in pregnancy compared with another intervention, or placebo, or no intervention. Cluster-RCTs would have been eligible for inclusion but none were identified. We excluded studies available as abstracts only and those using a cross-over design. Interventions could include advice on diet, lifestyle modification and medications (such as antacids, sucralfate, histamine 2-receptor antagonists, promotility drugs and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)). Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Main results: We included nine RCTs involving 725 women. However, five trials did not contribute data. Four trials involving 358 women contributed data. Trials were generally at mixed risk of bias. We only identified data for three comparisons: pharmaceutical treatment versus placebo or no treatment; acupuncture versus no treatment and pharmacological intervention versus advice on dietary and lifestyle changes. Pharmaceutical treatment compared with placebo or no treatment Two trials evaluated any pharmaceutical treatment compared with placebo or no treatment. One trial examined a treatment rarely used nowadays (intramuscular prostigmine 0.5 mg versus placebo). One trial evaluated the effect of magnesium and aluminium hydroxide plus simethicone liquid and tablet compared with placebo. For the primary outcome of this review (relief of heartburn), women who received pharmaceutical treatment reported complete heartburn relief more often than women receiving no treatment or placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.50 in two RCTs of 256 women, I2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). Data on partial relief of heartburn were heterogenous and showed no clear difference (average RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.76 in two RCTs of 256 women, very low-quality evidence). In terms of secondary outcomes, there was no clear difference in the rate of side effects between the pharmaceutical treatment group and the placebo/no treatment group (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.89 in two RCTs of 256 women, very low-quality evidence). Pharmacological intervention versus advice on dietary and lifestyle choices One study compared 1 g of sucralfate with advice on dietary and lifestyle choices in treating heartburn. More women in the sucralfate group experienced complete relief of heartburn compared to women who received advice on diet and lifestyle choices (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.07; participants = 65; studies = one). The only secondary outcome of interest addressed by this trial was side effects. The evidence was not clear on intervention side effects rate between the two groups (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.07 to 41.21; participants = 66; studies = one). There was only one instance of side effects in the pharmacological group. Acupuncture compared with no treatment One trial evaluated acupuncture compared with no treatment but did not report data relating to this review's primary outcome (relief of heartburn). In terms of secondary outcomes, there was no difference in the rate of side effects between women who had acupuncture and women who had no treatment (RR 2.43, 95% CI 0.11 to 55.89 in one RCT of 36 women). With regard to quality of life, women who had acupuncture reported improved ability to sleep (RR 2.80, 95% CI 1.14 to 6.86) and eat (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.18 in one RCT of 36 women). The following secondary outcomes were not reported upon in any of the trials included in the review: miscarriage, preterm labour, maternal satisfaction, fetal anomalies, intrauterine growth restriction, low birthweight. Authors' conclusions: There are no large-scale RCTs to assess heartburn relief in pregnancy. This review of nine small studies (which involved data from only four small studies) indicates that there are limited data suggesting that heartburn in pregnancy could be completely relieved by pharmaceutical treatment. Three outcomes were assessed and assigned a quality rating using the GRADE methods. Evidence from two trials for the outcome of complete relief of heartburn was assessed as of moderate quality. Evidence for the outcomes of partial heartburn relief and side effects was graded to be of very low quality. Downgrading decisions were based in part on the small size of the trials and on heterogenous and imprecise results. There are insufficient data to assess acupuncture versus no treatment and no data to assess other comparisons (miscarriage, preterm labour, maternal satisfaction, fetal anomalies, intrauterine growth restriction, low birthweight). Further RCTs are needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for heartburn in pregnancy. Future research should also address other medications such as histamine 2-receptor antagonists, promotility drugs, proton pump inhibitors, and a raft-forming alginate reflux suppressant in treatment of heartburn in pregnancy. More research is needed on acupuncture and other complimentary therapies as treatments for heartburn in pregnancy. Future research should also evaluate any adverse outcomes, maternal satisfaction with treatment and measure pregnant women's quality of life in relation to the intervention.

N2  - Hypothesis. Cancer patients frequently suffer from poor sleep quality. Bryophyllum pinnatum is a herbal medication used in anthroposophic medicine, which has been shown to be associated with improvements in sleep quality during pregnancy with only few and minor or moderate side-effects reported. In this study, the sleep quality of cancer patients during treatment with B pinnatum was investigated. Study Design. In this prospective, observational study, cancer patients suffering from sleep problems were treated with B pinnatum (350 mg tablets, corresponding to 50% of leaf pressed juice [Weleda AG, Arlesheim, Switzerland], dosage at physicians consideration, but most frequently 2 tablets with evening meal and 2 before going to bed). Methods. Sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), daily sleepiness (Epworth Sleeping Scale [ESS]), and fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) were assessed at the beginning of the treatment and after 3 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded. From the 28 recruited patients, 20 completed both questionnaires and were considered in the present analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Results. Patients were 61 ± 10.4 years old and the majority were female (17 out of 20). During treatment with B pinnatum, the PSQI decreased from 12.2 ± 3.62 to 9.1 ± 3.61 (P <.01), and ESS changed from 8.4 ± 3.18 to 7.1 ± 3.98 (P <.05). There was no change in FSS. The treatment was well tolerated by the majority of patients, with only 6 patients reporting discomfort that might have been caused by B pinnatum (fatigue n = 3, dry throat n = 1, agitation n = 1, difficult digestion n = 1). No serious adverse drug reactions were detected. Conclusion. B pinnatum may be a suitable treatment for sleep problems of cancer patients. Controlled, randomized clinical trials of the use of B pinnatum in sleep disorders are urgently needed.

N2  - Background:Maternal obesity increases offspring propensity to metabolic dysfunctions and to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. The circadian clock is a transcriptional/epigenetic molecular machinery synchronising physiological processes to coordinate energy utilisation within a 24-h light/dark period. Alterations in rhythmicity have profound effects on metabolic pathways, which we sought to investigate in offspring with programmed NAFLD.Methods:Mice were fed a standard or an obesogenic diet (OD), before and throughout pregnancy, and during lactation. Offspring were weaned onto standard or an OD at 3 weeks postpartum and housed in 12:12 light/dark conditions. Biochemical and histological indicators of NAFLD and fibrosis, analysis of canonical clock genes with methylation status and locomotor activity were investigated at 6 months.Results:We show that maternal obesity interacts with an obesogenic post-weaning diet to promote the development of NAFLD with disruption of canonical metabolic rhythmicity gene expression in the liver. We demonstrate hypermethylation of BMAL-1 (brain and muscle Arnt like-1) and Per2 promoter regions and altered 24-h rhythmicity of hepatic pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators.Conclusions:These data implicate disordered circadian rhythms in NAFLD and suggest that disruption of this system during critical developmental periods may be responsible for the onset of chronic liver disease in adulthood.

N2  - Purpose: Physiologic changes in the cardiac, respiratory, and renal systems in pregnancy likely impact ventilatory control. Though obstructive sleep apnea and snoring are common in the pregnant population, the predisposition to central respiratory events during sleep and the prevalence of such events is less well studied. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of central apneas during sleep in pregnant women and non-pregnant controls suspected of sleep disordered breathing. Methods: Twenty-five pregnant women referred for polysomnography for sleep disordered breathing were compared with non-pregnant controls matched for age, body mass index, gender, and apnea hypopnea index (AHI). Central apnea index was defined as the number of central apneas per hour of sleep, and mixed apnea index was defined as the number of mixed apneas per hour of sleep. Results: Sixty-four percent of pregnant women had a respiratory disturbance index >5 events per hour of sleep. Mean body mass index was 44.1 ± 6.9 kg/m2 pregnant compared to 44.0 ± 7.3 kg/m2 in controls. The total number of central apneas observed during sleep in the pregnant group consisted of two central apneas in one patient, and of 98 central apneas in 11 patients in the control group (p = 0.05). Median central apnea index was low in both groups (pregnant 0, interquartile range (IQR) 0, 0 vs. non-pregnant 0, IQR 0, 0.2, p = 0.04). Mixed apnea index was similarly low in both groups. Conclusion: Despite some physiologic changes of pregnancy that impact ventilatory control, the prevalence of central sleep apnea was low in our sample of overweight pregnant women with sleep-disordered breathing.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common and serious disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops during sleep, is associated with excess weight and obesity. Little is known about the co-occurrence of OSA among pregnant women from low and middle-income countries. Methods: We examined the extent to which maternal pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity status are associated with high risk for OSA, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness in 1032 pregnant women in Lima, Peru. The Berlin questionnaire was used to identify women at high risk for OSA. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were used to examine sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression procedures were employed to estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for putative confounding factors. Results: Compared with lean women (<25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight women (25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) had 3.69-fold higher odds of high risk for OSA (95 % CI 1.82-7.50). The corresponding aOR for obese women (≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was 13.23 (95 % CI: 6.25-28.01). Obese women, as compared with their lean counterparts had a 1.61-fold higher odds of poor sleep quality (95 % CI: 1.00-2.63). Conclusion: Overweight or obese pregnant women have increased odds of sleep disorders, particularly OSA. OSA screening and risk management may be indicated among pregnant women in low and middle income countries, particularly those undergoing rapid epidemiologic transitions characterized by increased prevalence of excessive adult weight gain.

N2  - Objective: To assess the risk of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and related factors at the end of pregnancy using the Berlin questionnaire.Methods: A total of 367 women at the end of pregnancy (median gestational age 39 weeks) were interviewed with the Berlin questionnaire and a general survey containing maternal socio-demographic and anthropometric information. Neonatal outcome data were also assessed.Results: Median age for the whole sample was 31 years. According to the Berlin questionnaire, 39.8% were positive for high risk of OSAHS. Upon bivariate analysis, higher risk of OSAHS was significantly related to church attendance, and higher pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), current BMI, weight, neck and arm circumference and systolic blood pressure at survey. Logistic regression analysis found that higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (OR 2.71 95% CI 1.84-4.00, p < 0.0001) and higher maternal weight at survey (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.78-5.17, p < 0.0001) were significantly related to a higher risk of OSAHS.Conclusion: The risk of OSAHS is relatively high at the end of pregnancy and related to a higher pre-pregnancy BMI and higher maternal weight at survey. Further studies are needed to confirm our results with a diagnostic tool, such as polysomnography or another similar yet less complicated to carry out procedure.

N2  - It has been postulated that prenatal cigarette smoke exposure (CSE) increases the risk for sudden infant death syndrome. The victims of infant death syndrome suffer from respiratory abnormalities, such as central apnea, diminished chemoreflex and alteration in respiratory pattern during sleep. However, no experimental evidence on CSE model exists to confirm whether prenatal CSE gives rise to reduction of neonatal central chemoreception in in vitro preparations in absence of peripheral sensory feedback. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that maternal CSE during pregnancy depresses central chemoreception of the neonatal rats. The pregnant rats were divided into two groups, control (n = 8) and CSE (n = 8). Experiments were performed on neonatal (0-3days) rat pups. Fictive respiratory activity was monitored by recording the rhythmic discharge from the hypoglossal rootlets of the medullary slices obtained from the neonatal rats. The burst frequency (BF) and integrated amplitude (IA) of the discharge were analyzed. Their responses to acidified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) were tested to indicate the change of the central chemosensitivity. Under condition of perfusing with standard aCSF (pH 7.4), no significant difference was detected between the two groups in either BF or IA (P>0.05). Under condition of perfusing with acidified aCSF (pH 7.0), BF was increased and IA was decreased in both groups (P<0.01). However, their change rates in the CSE group were obviously smaller than that in the control group, 66.98 ± 10.11% vs. 143.75 ± 15.41% for BF and -22.38 ± 2.51% vs. -44.90 ± 3.92%for IA (P<0.01). In conclusion, these observations, in a prenatal CSE model, provide important evidence that maternal smoking during pregnancy exerts adverse effects on central chemoreception of neonates.

N2  - Aim: To determine whether women with twins have significantly higher rates of sleep disordered breathing due to the increased weight gain associated with multiple pregnancy. Background: Multifetal gestation is a well-established risk factor for preeclampsia as is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Increased weight gain in pregnancy can be associated with both conditions. Methods: Women attending antenatal clinics with twin pregnancies from 2009 to 2011 were administered two standardised sleep questionnaires at time of initial presentation. The Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale are used to identify high risk of SDB. Anthropomorphic data, pregnancy care and pregnancy outcome were collected. The pregnancies were compared with singletons matched 6:1 for gestation, age and parity from a much larger study cohort studying sleep in pregnancy. Results: Twin pregnancies (n = 42) were compared with 252 singleton pregnancies. Twins had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures at initial testing. (p < 0.03). This was not associated with an increased initial weight, or with an increased weight gain. Rates of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) were higher in the twin pregnancy group (23.8%) compared with the singleton group (12.3%). The twin population had greater risk of SDB, identified by the Berlin Questionnaire (p = 0.003) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (p = 0.008). Conclusions: Increased rates of HDP in twin pregnancy were not accounted for by increases in sleep disordered breathing or weight gain in pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Women appear to be increasingly susceptible to snoring and sleep disorders breathing during pregnancy. However pregnant women with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) are less likely to be assessed or to receive a diagnosis. Objective: the aim of this report was to evaluate the prevalence of common symptoms of OSAHS in pregnant women and secondarily to seek a link with Pregnancy-induced blood hypertension and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Method: An observational study of 120 pregnant women who responded to a predetermined questionnaire 24 hours after giving birth in a maternity. Results: the mean age was 28±5,6 years, the mean parity was 1.88±1,1 and the average duration of pregnancy was 39.33±1,6 weeks. IUGR, Pregnancy-induced blood hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus was identified in 4.2%; 2.5% and 1.7% of participants, respectively. No women had developed eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. The most 3 frequently reported sleep-related symptoms were nycturia (84.2%), poor sleep quality (55%) and sleep onset insomnia (38.3%). Snoring occurred in 17.5%of the patients while 98,2% of them did not snore before pregnancy. The prevalence of this symptom was significantly higher in eldest women (p < 0.03). The average Epworth sleep score was 3.18 (0 à 12) and was significantly correlated with IUGR (0.045) but not with Pregnancy-induced blood hypertension or premature birth. Obesity was significantly more frequent among women with daytime sleepiness or snoring. Conclusion: OSAHS in pregnancy seems to have important fetal outcomes. Pregnant women should be assessed for symptoms of OSAHS and suspected cases should be offered polysomnography.

N2  - INTRODUCTION Preterm birth is one of the most common adverse pregnancy outcomes and one of the major public health concerns also. Several risk factors have been identified, but understanding of the exact etiology has been remained unknown until now. Poor sleep quality is correlate with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated whether sleep quality during pregnancy is a relevant risk factor with preterm birth. METHODS AND MATERIALS This is a cohort study on 539 pregnant women in 20-29 weeks gestation. The method of sampling was continuum. Data was gathered by demographic questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). After completing the questionnaires, the study subjects were divided in two groups; good and poor sleep quality. Two groups were fallowed until the end of 37 weeks gestation by telephone every 2 weeks. Risk factors those affected preterm birth were evaluate in two groups. Statistical analysis carried out with t-test, chi-square, Mann- Whitney U and Mantel-Haenszel. RESULTS A total 309 pregnant women had poor sleep quality and 230 women had good sleep quality. The mean score of Pittsburgh questionnaire in term deliveries was 6/30 ± 3/03 and in preterm deliveries were 8/43 ± 3/79. The rate of preterm birth in good sleep group was %5/6 and in poor sleep group was %13/7. There was significant difference in the rate of preterm birth in two groups (P = 0/003). The entire risk factors associated with preterm birth except history of preterm birth, abortion, sever physical activity, stress and second hand smokers in two groups was consistence. But Mantel-Haenszel test eliminate the effect of them in two groups and showed that there was no dependent correlate between sleep quality and happening the preterm birth. CONCLUSION There was an association between sleep quality and preterm birth.

N2  - Objective: To examine the independent and joint relationships of poor subjective sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation among pregnant women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 641 pregnant women attending prenatal care clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale. Antepartum subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression procedures were performed to estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) adjusted for confounders. Results: Overall, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in this cohort was 16.8% and poor subjective sleep quality was more common among women endorsing suicidal ideation as compared to their counterparts who did not (47.2% vs. 24.8%, P< .001). After adjustment for confounders including maternal depression, poor subjective sleep quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of > 5 vs. ≤ 5) was associated with a 1.7-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR=1.67; 95% CI 1.02-2.71). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in an 18% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (aOR=1.18; 95% CI 1.08-1.28). Women with both poor subjective sleep quality and depression had a 3.5-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR=3.48; 95% CI 1.96-6.18) as compared with those who had neither risk factor. Conclusion: Poor subjective sleep quality was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation. Replication of these findings may promote investments in studies designed to examine the efficacy of sleep-focused interventions to treat pregnant women with sleep disorders and suicidal ideation.

N2  - Objectives: Willis-Ekbom disease/restless legs syndrome (WED/RLS) is the most common sleep-related movement disorder in pregnancy. We designed a prospective longitudinal study to investigate the correlates of WED/RLS during and after pregnancy. Design: A total of 138 pregnant women with WED/RLS and a control group of 251 age-matched pregnant women were enrolled prospectively. A questionnaire was administered during a face-to-face interview at first evaluation during pregnancy and three months after delivery. Results: Among all women in the first trimester, 15.6% were diagnosed with WED/RLS, whereas 32.8% of those in the second trimester and 38.8% of those in the third trimester were diagnosed with WED/RLS (p = 0.032). In regression analysis, later gestational age [. p < 0.001; odds ratio (OR) 1.054] and previous history of WED/RLS (p = 0.001; OR 2.795) were positively correlated with the presence of WED/RLS, while ferritin levels (p = 0.001; OR 0.956) were negatively correlated with the presence of WED/RLS. Ferritin levels were also negatively correlated with the International RLS Study Group severity index (p = 0.041). Forty-eight patients (34.8%) experienced WED/RLS symptomatology after delivery. The ferritin levels were lower, and the mean number of pregnancies was higher, in women with residual WED/RLS (p = 0.008). Conclusion: Our survey showed that WED/RLS was more common in the second and third trimesters. Emergence of WED/RLS during the second trimester was strongly associated with residual WED/RLS. Lower ferritin levels were associated with both WED/RLS in pregnancy and residual WED/RLS after delivery. A higher number of pregnancies were also associated with a greater likelihood of having residual WED/RLS after delivery.

N2  - Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) represents a spectrum of disorders, including habitual snoring and obstructivesleep apnea (OSA). Sleep disordered breathing is characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia, airflowlimitation, and recurrent arousals, which may lead to tissue hypoperfusion, hypoxia, and inflammation. In thisstudy, we aimed to examine whether SDB during pregnancy was associated with histopathologic evidenceof chronic placental hypoxia and/or uteroplacental underperfusion. The placentas of women with OSA (n = 23) and habitual snoring (n = 78) as well as nonsnorer controls (n = 47) were assessed for histopathologic andimmunohistochemical markers of chronic hypoxia and uteroplacental underperfusion. Fetal normoblastemia wassignificantly more prevalent in SDB placentas than in those of nonsnorer controls (34.6% and 56.5% in snorersand OSA, respectively, versus 6.4% in controls). Expression of the tissue hypoxia marker carbonicanhydrase IX (CAIX) was more common in OSA placentas than controls (81.5% and 91.3% in snorersand OSA, respectively, versus 57.5% in controls). Adjusting for confounders such as body mass index, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension did not alter the results. The uteroplacental underperfusion scores weresimilar among the 3 groups. Our findings suggest that SDB during pregnancy is associated with fetoplacentalhypoxia, as manifested by fetal normoblastemia and increased placental carbonic anhydrase IX immunoreactivity. The clinical implications and underlying mechanisms remain to be determined.

N2  - Introduction Nonfreezing cold induced injury (NFCII), often referred to as Immersion Foot, results from prolonged exposure to cold, wet environments at or above freezing temperatures. We present a pregnant woman who developed an unexplained dermatitis associated with progressive pain that was only relieved by submerging her feet in ice baths. The pain became intolerable upon removing her feet from cool water. Continuous regional anesthesia was used for pain control and to facilitate healing of the affected areas. A 40 year old Caucasian female without significant past medical history presented with a five week history of rash and pain to dorsal the aspects of both feet. The patient reported 8-10/10 burning and sharp pain that was only relieved by soaking her feet in cold water. At time of admission, she reported soaking her feet for greater than 20 hours per day for the past week. Physical exam revealed numerous superficial ulcerations and pustules over bilateral ankles and dorsal feet. (Figure 1) Outpatient analgesics included Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen 5mg/325mg q 4hours PRN which she denied as being helpful. The patient remained painful despite Dilaudid IV PCA and was unable to sleep. The Acute Pain Management service was consulted on Day 2 of her admission. Material and methods Informed consent for bilateral lower extremity peripheral nerve blocks was obtained. We preformed bilateral single injection ultrasound guided saphenous nerve blocks using a sub-sartorial approach and ultrasound guided placement of bilateral popliteal sciatic nerve catheters. 10mL of ropivicaine 0.5% with 1:400,000 epinephrine given in each space. A continuous infusion of ropivicaine 0.2% was initially set to 8mL/hour. Over the next 5 days, the patient was followed by the Acute Pain Management Service and catheter infusion rates were titrated to optimize pain relief. The patient was also started on oral gabapentin 300mg TID and provided IV hydromorphone PCA for breakthrough pain. Discussion Cooling to 15C profoundly reduces cutaneous blood flow, leading to direct and ischemic injury to microvasculature and neural tissues. Control over blood supply is determined by both local mediators and central hypothalamic control mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. NFCII is characterized by three phases: 1. Pre-hyperemic phase during cold exposure when there is intense vasoconstriction and numbness with loss of proprioception 2. Hyperemic phase of burning and throbbing when pain increases during periods of rewarming also associated with blistering and desquamation 3. Post-hyperemic phase of cold sensitivity, persistent paresthesias and possibly chronic pain [1.] Davis describes a case series of patients who self treat erythromelalgia and develop immersion foot. He describes a cycle of escalating pain and increased time soaking feet often at the expense of social isolation and physical disability [2.] Painful dermatological lesions such as in erythromelagia have been treated with sympathetic blocks or continuous epidural infusion, but these were not viable options in this parturient. We report a case where we were able to use regional anesthesia to provide safe and effective acute pain control, minimize opioid consumption, and stop cold exposure to allow for healing of cutaneous lesions.

N2  - Objective: Antidepressants are used to treat depression and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Levels of evidence, however, are low, and their use is often limited by side effects and pharmacokinetic interactions, fostering the need for further research. Agomelatine is a novel melatonergic antidepressant. Its short half-life, lack of pharmacokinetic interactions, and positive effects on circadian rhythms and possibly neurocognition constitute its relevance in schizophrenia. Methods: The AGOPSYCH study (NCT01822418) evaluates the antidepressive efficacy of agomelatine in schizophrenia over a 6-week period and a 6-week extension phase in an open-prospective design. Secondary outcome parameters are psychosocial performance, neurocognition, sleep patterns, sexual function as well as safety and tolerability aspects. Data is acquired at fixed intervals by the use of established rating scales. Schizophrenia patients fulfilling the criteria of major depression (HAMD17 ≥ 15 P., CDSS ≥ 8 P.) can participate. At inclusion, positive symptoms have to be under control (PANSSpos ≤ 15 P.), and antipsychotic treatment must have been stable for 2 weeks. Liver dysfunction, pregnancy, breastfeeding and current substance dependence result in study exclusion. Results: To date, 24 patients were enrolled. Within the completers (n = 19), agomelatine treatment resulted in a significant improvement of depressive symptoms. In parallel, negative symptoms reduced and the level of psychosocial functioning increased. Positive symptoms remained unaltered. With the exception of one case of newonset hypertension, side-effects were mild, rare and transient. Blood counts and laboratory parameters including liver enzymes were stable, and no pharmacokinetic interactions occurred. Neurocognition was improved significantly on the MCCB total score, whereas changes in subdomains were too subtle to be significant. Conclusion: Agomelatine showed a high anti depressive potency at a favourable range of side effects in schizophrenia without challenging the patients' mental states. The data presented is limited by the small sample size, the short observation period, the open-prospective design and the lack of a control group and needs to be replicated in randomized head-to-head trials.

N2  - Background and aims: To identify maternal single nucleotide gene polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with GDM or influencing fasting and 2 hours glucose levels at OGTT. Materials and methods: A set of 77 SNPs was selected based on their previously reported contribution to beta-cell dysfunction or genesis, incretin effect, K+-channel function, amyloid formation, zinc transport, insulin resistance, obesity, IGF system, glucose homeostasis, neuronal regulation of appetite, energy balance or immunoregulation. Themajority of these SNPs were previously reported to be associated with either type 2 diabetes or with a metabolic trait. Thus far 149 pregnant women with GDM, 269 non-diabetic pregnant women and 154 neonates born to mothers with GDM and 274 neonates born to non-diabetic mothers were enrolled. This study was conducted in two Hungarian and one Austrian centers. Genomic DNA was isolated from a total of 846 samples using a magnetic bead based robotized approach (Hamilton Robotics, Magna Starlet). PCR-based KASP™ genotyping (FRET based) assay (LGC Genomics) was used for the bi-allelic discrimination of SNPs. Logistic regression (logit) risk model and subsequent algorithms written in “R” statistical programming language were used to assess Odds Ratios, pvalues and to detect potential gene-gene interactions. Maternal gene variants were also assessed for association with fasting and 2 hours plasma glucose levels at routine OGTT (24-28th gestational week). Results: Carrying a G allele of the rs10830963 of the melatonin receptor 1B (MNTR1B) or a G allele of the rs6832769 of the clock circadian regulator (CLOCK) genes were most significantly associated with the binary trait of GDM (OR=1.708-1.56, p<10-5). In qualitative trait analysis we found that the rs10830963 in MTNR1B was consistently associated with increased fasting and 2 hours glucose levels. The rs10871777 (G allele) of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) was associated with an increase in 2 hours plasma glucose values at OGTT. In contrast, the A allele of the rs1143634 of the interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) gene was associated with decreased fasting glucose levels.We identified significant genegene interactions between MC4R and CLOCK gene variants (rs1087177- rs6832769 and rs17782313-rs6892769 with OR=2.09, p=1.4×10-3 and OR=2.11, p=1.1×10-3, respectively) and between rs10830963 of MNTR1B and rs4712526 of the CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1) gene (OR=2.17, p=1.7×10-3) when interactions were analyzed for GDM binary trait. Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that a few SNPs could be associated with GDM or qualitative traits. Surprisingly, the identified gene polymorphisms are likely to participate in neuronal regulation of appetite, circadian rhythm, energy balance, immunoregulation or are with unknown function.

N2  - Background: PAQLQ and C-ACT are widely used as standardized tools for the assessment of the quality of life and the control of asthma in children. Pittsburg Sleep Quality of Index (PSQI) is a questionnaire to assess the quality of sleep, while Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) is a scale for the evaluation of general welfare. The aim of this study was to assess differences by severity level of asthma in a sample of outpatients children with Asthma (A). Method: Spirometry, PAQLQ, C-ACT and PSQI in children visited for suspected respiratory disease at IBIM from September 2011 to October 2014 were collected. Medical history was taken in a standardized way. Spirometry was performed using a portable spirometer (Pony FX, Cosmed, Italy); spirometric values were expressed as percent predicted using GLI-2012equation. Standard methodology was applied for Skin Prick Testing; atopy was defined as at least a positive reaction. Statistical analyses were performed using R (3.1.0). Results: Of 144 pts, Males 87 (60%), Females 67 (40%) ranged 6 to11 years were included: 76 (53%) with Persistent Asthma (PA), 68 (47%) with Intermittent Asthma (IA). Significant differences ofmean (SD) for PAQLQ total score in PA=5.1(1.01) vsIA=5.44(0.96), P = 0.04, for PSQI in PA=2.24(2.47) vsIA=1.53 (1.59), P = 0.04, for FEV1% in PA=92.41 (18.77) vs IA=98.89 (14.98), P = 0.02, and for FEF25-75% in PA=72.74 (21.86) vs IA=99.42 (32.42), P < 0.0001 were found. In PA a greater C-ACT and VAS average score were found in children with Not- Smoke-Exposure-in- Pregnancy (NSEP) than in the exposed ones (SEP), respectively for C-ACT [NSEP=20.74 (3.31) vs SEP=15.83 (7.17), P = 0.01] and for VAS [NSEP= 8.1(1.66) vs SEP =6.33(2.94), P = 0.02]. No difference of C-ACT total score and Atopy index were found in PA vs IA. By a logistic regression significant effects for PA were FEF25-75%, indeed if FEF25-75%increases of one unit the risk to be PA decreases of 0.05 (P < 0.001), and PSQI, indeed if PSQI increases of one unit the risk to be PA increases of 0.28 (P = 0.03). Conclusion: In persistent asthmatics a greater respiratory function impairment and an higher burden of disease were found. Medical history of early smoke exposure should be also taken into account when a composite (objective and subjective) assessment of asthma is performed in children.

N2  - Aim To identify and describe infant deaths presenting suddenly and unexpectedly in whom there was a history of maternal methadone consumption or misuse of drugs during pregnancy. Methods Retrospective review of neonatal postmortem examinations between 2004 and 2011. Results A total of 138 autopsies were performed in infants up to 28 days. Thirty-two cases (23%) presented suddenly and unexpectedly. In 12 of 32 (37.5%), in whom the cause of death remained unexplained after a thorough postmortem, there was a history of methadone use and/or other drugs of abuse during pregnancy. Their mean age at death was 11 days (range 1-28 days). Multiple risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome were present in these 12 cases: smoking (10), prematurity (7), and inappropriate sleeping place (8). Five mothers were positive for hepatitis C. The history was inconsistent with the findings in only one case. Conclusion An unexpectedly high proportion of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly in the first month had a history of maternal substance misuse. All had multiple risk factors, for sudden infant death syndrome many avoidable. We would stress the need to emphasise the 'Safe Sleep' message with these families at every contact with health professionals.

N2  - Subjects suffering from an Anxiety Disorder show an increased production and perception of autonomic symptoms, even in relation to hyperesthesia and abnormal perceptive discrimination, including sensorial gating reduction. In particular, some gating electroencephalography (EEG) measures, mainly modulated by cholinergic systems, are altered in Panic Disorder. The electric stimulation of peripheral nerves evokes on the primary somatosensory cortex a secondary High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) train. Moreover, sleep phases and arousal states are able to modulate HFOs, which don't undergo habituation and increase in wideness for new and/or irregular stimuli. HFOs seem to reflect gating integrity; therefore this could be an expression of cholinergic pattern intensity. Objectives: To investigate the presence of HFOs alterations in patients with anxiety disorders vs. controls. Methods: Our clinical sample was made of 14 patients (M/F 3/4; age 18-50) affected by Anxiety Disorders according to the DSM-5 criteria, drug free for at least 1 year, with no Axis I comorbidity, no severe physical illness, nor pregnancy, no addiction to any substances or alcohol during the last 6 months, no history of neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, neuropathies or CNS damage. The patients enrolled in our study were mainly affected by Panic Disorder (PD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The control sample included 18 healthy subjects (M/F 1/2; age 33-50). Somatosensory evoked potentials were measured by a fivechannels- device with active electrodes placed on contralateral parietal area; the intensity of the stimulation has been set over motor threshold; series of 400 pulses on the median nerve have been delivered by regularly spaced stimuli (1 Hz). The traces have been referred to a time-frequency analysis; digital filtration has been made with band pass of 400-800 Hz, specifying both start and end of burst according to appropriate convention (wideness of burst: area below rectified waves). Statistical analysis were made using Mann-Whitney test. Results: By comparing 14 patients affected by an Anxiety Disorder to 18 controls we found that the wideness of the early burst of HFOs increased markedly in Anxiety Disorders patients (p-value=0.007); moreover this effect was also prominent for the late burst (p-value=0.004). Discussion: According to these data, Anxiety Disorders patients show growing HFOs, which are a direct expression of sensory gating alteration and an indirect assessment of a particular cholinergic functioning. This arrangement could be responsible for the clinical and physiopathological phenomena of Anxiety Disorders. However, several refinements are needed, including a wider patient sample, a more detailed discrimination among diagnostic categories of Anxiety Disorders, and the correlation of neurophysiological data to psychological measures of cognitive performance. Conclusions: If confirmed, these data are compatible with an alteration of sensory gating and an up-regulation of cholinergic receptors in subjects suffering from anxiety disorders. This would be potentially able to alterate early processing of sensorial information, independently from late cognitive processing.

N2  - Background: Pheochromocytoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that produces symptoms through the excess release of catecholamines. However, the classic symptoms occur together in less than 50% of patients. In these patients, the diagnosis is often missed, and the patient can develop severe pheochromocytoma crisis (PMC) during incidental surgery, pregnancy or administration of medications. This report presents the case of a young woman with an unsuspected pheochromoctyoma who rapidly developed PMC after a course of steroid therapy for poison ivy. Case Report: An otherwise healthy 28 year old female presented to the emergency department (ED)complaining of vomiting, nausea, palpitations and right lower abdominal pain that awoke her from sleep. Two days prior she had been prescribed prednisone and cortisone cream for a poison ivy that had developed on her left lower leg earlier that week. The patient rapidly became hypotensive with episodes of hypoxia in the ED. Patient was started on norepinephrine and transferred to intensive care (ICU) on mechanical ventilation. On arrival in the ICU, the patient developed ventricular tachycardia and was placed on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Patient was also required continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, multiple vasopressors, and broad spectrum antibiotics. Her clinical condition continued to worsen as she developed progressive four limb ischemia. On day 3, the patient's neurologic function remained poor and her EEG showed diffuse cerebral dysfunction. A care conference was held, care was withdrawn and the patient expired. On autopsy, a right adrenal pheochromocytoma was found. In addition, multisystem organ failure was revealed showing extensive myocardial necrosis, pericardial effusion, diffuse alveolar damage, hepatomegaly, and diffuse cerebral edema with bilateral uncal and tonsillar herniation. Discussion: Steroids help induce the production of catecholamines by stimulating the enzymes involved in their production. PMC should be considered in any patient with unexplained shock or left ventricular failure, multi-organ failure, hypertensive crisis or unexplained lactic acidosis. Initial investigations should include urine and plasma catecholamines and metanephrines. The recommended management of PMC includes the use of alpha-blockade, which isstrongly associated with survival of a crisis. Conclusion: PMC is a rare occurrence, but if unrecognized can be deadly. This case highlights that crisis can be triggered by medications and that PMC can cause a wide variety of derangements that often mimics other disease processes.

N2  - There was evaluated the risk to health in females employed in shift work, including night shifts. According to the data of periodical medical examinations health indices of 403 females employed in shift work, including night shifts, were compared with indices of 205 females--workers of administrative units of the same enterprise. Overall relative risk (RR) for the health disorder associated with the night shift was 1.2 (95%; confidence interval (CI): 1.09-1.28). A statistically significant increase in risk was observed in relation to uterine fibroids (OR 1.3; 95% CI: 1.06-1.54), mastopathy (OR 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2-1.6), inorganic sleep disorders (OR 8.8; 95% CI 2.6-29.8). At the boundary of the statistical significance there was the increase in the risk for obesity (OR 1.2; 95% C: 0.97-1.39), hypertension (OR 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9-1.5) and endometriosis (OR 1.5; 95% CI: 0.98-2.16). There was revealed an adverse effect of night shifts on the gestation course: ectopic pregnancy in the experimental group occurred 6.6 times more frequently than in the control group (95% CI: 0.87-50.2), and spontaneous abortion--1.7 times (95% CI: 0.95-3.22). The performed study has once again confirmed the negative impact of smoking on women's reproductive health: smoking women in the experimental group compared with the control group smokers had 2.7 times increased risk of uterine fibroids (within 1.06-7.0), the risk in non-smokers was significantly lower--1.2 (0.98-1.4). The findings suggest about a wide range of health problems related to employment on shift work, including night shifts, which indicates to the need for adoption of regulatory and preventive measures aimed to this professional group.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the modifications provoked by betamethasone, used in prophylaxis for RDS, on fetal heart rate and variability. Materials and methods: Retrospective study including 58 pregnant women treated with corticosteroids for risk of preterm birth. Fetal heart rate and long term variability have been reviewed and evaluated with cardiotocographic examinations performed for each patient at time 0 (before betamethasone administration),within the first 12 hours after administration, between 12 and 24 hours, between 24 and 36 hours and after 36 hours. Results: Long term variability of fetal heart rate is altered above all in the period between 24 and 36 hours after the first administration of betamethasone (in the 48% of cases). This modification consists in the increase of variability in the 68% of cases. The baseline of heart rate shows a modification inversely proportional to the variability's one. Conclusion: The influence of corticosteroids on the fetal nervous centers involved in the regulation of the sleep-wake rhythm and in the sympathetic-vagal balance implies the possible transitory alteration of the fetal heart rate baseline and variability.

N2  - Background: The biology of peripartum depression remains unclear, with altered stress and the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal axis response having been implicated in its pathophysiology. Methods: The current study was undertaken as a part of the BASIC project (Biology, Affect, Stress, Imaging, Cognition), a population-based longitudinal study of psychological wellbeing during pregnancy and the postpartum period in Uppsala County, Sweden, in order to assess the association between evening salivary cortisol levels and depressive symptoms in the peripartum period. Three hundred and sixty-five pregnant women from the BASIC cohort were recruited at pregnancy week 18 and instructed to complete a Swedish validated version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at the 36th week of pregnancy as well as the sixth week after delivery. At both times, they were also asked to provide evening salivary samples for cortisol analysis. A comprehensive review of the relevant literature is also provided. Results: Women with postpartum EPDS score ≥ 10 had higher salivary evening cortisol at six weeks postpartum compared to healthy controls (median cortisol 1.19 vs 0.89 nmol/L). A logistic regression model showed a positive association between cortisol levels and depressive symptoms postpartum (OR = 4.1; 95% CI 1.7-9.7). This association remained significant even after controlling for history of depression, use of tobacco, partner support, breastfeeding, stressful life events, and sleep problems, as possible confounders (aOR = 4.5; 95% CI 1.5-14.1). Additionally, women with postpartum depressive symptoms had higher postpartum cortisol levels compared to both women with depressive symptoms antenatally and controls (p = 0.019 and p = 0.004, respectively). Conclusions: Women with depressive symptoms postpartum had higher postpartum cortisol levels, indicating an altered response of the HPA-axis in postpartum depression.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between objectively assessed sleep and blood glucose in a prospective cohort of women recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: Women with GDM were enrolled immediately after attending a GDM education class. All patients were recruited during their first week of attempted dietary management of GDM. They were instructed on the use of a glucometer and on the principles of a GDM diet. Women wore an actigraph and completed a sleep log for 7 consecutive days. Glucose records were compared against the objective sleep data. Linear mixed model analysis was used to estimate the association of sleep duration on morning fasting and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose concentrations. RESULTS: Thirty-seven participants provided data for 213 sleep intervals that corresponded to at least one glucose reading. Sleep duration was negatively associated with fasting and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose concentrations In analyses adjusted for age, gestational age, and body mass index, a 1-hour increase in sleep time was associated with statistically significant reductions in fasting glucose (-2.09 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.98 to -0.20) as well as postprandial glucose concentrations (lunch -4.62 mg/dL, 95% CI -8.75 to -0.50; dinner -6.07 mg/dL, 95% CI -9.40 to -2.73). CONCLUSION: Short sleep durations are associated with worsened glucose control in women with gestational diabetes. Educating women on healthy sleep and screening for and treating sleep disorders during pregnancy may have a role in optimizing blood glucose control in gestational diabetes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II

N2  - Background: Stillbirth occurring after 28 weeks gestation affects between 1.5-4.5 per 1,000 births in high-income countries. The majority of stillbirths in this setting occur in women without risk factors. In addition, many established risk factors such as nulliparity and maternal age are not amenable to modification during pregnancy. Identification of other risk factors which could be amenable to change in pregnancy should be a priority in stillbirth prevention research. Therefore, this study aimed to utilise an online survey asking women who had a stillbirth about their pregnancy in order to identify any common symptoms and experiences. Methods: A web-based survey. Results: A total of 1,714 women who had experienced a stillbirth >3 weeks prior to enrolment completed the survey. Common experiences identified were: perception of changes in fetal movement (63 % of respondents), reports of a "gut instinct" that something was wrong (68 %), and perceived time of death occurring overnight (56 %). A quarter of participants believed that their baby's death was due to a cord issue and another 18 % indicated that they did not know the reason why their baby died. In many cases (55 %) the mother believed the cause of death was different to that told by clinicians. Conclusions: This study confirms the association between altered fetal movements and stillbirth and highlights novel associations that merit closer scrutiny including a maternal gut instinct that something was wrong. The potential importance of maternal sleep is highlighted by the finding of more than half the mothers believing their baby died during the night. This study supports the importance of listening to mothers' concerns and symptoms during pregnancy and highlights the need for thorough investigation of stillbirth and appropriate explanation being given to parents.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Antenatal care has several benefits for expecting mothers and birth outcomes; yet many mothers do not utilise this service in Nepal. Mass media may play an important role in increasing the use of antenatal care and other maternal health services. However, the effect of mass media on increasing health service utilisation has remained an under studied area in Nepal. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of mass media on the utilisation of antenatal care services in rural Nepal.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Sinurjoda Village Development Committee of Dhanusha District, Nepal. A total of 205 mothers of children aged under 1 year were selected using systematic random sampling. Logistic regression was employed to examine the association between selected antenatal care services and mass media exposure after adjusting for other independent variables.
RESULTS: A majority of mothers were exposed to mass media. Radio was accessible to most (60.0%) of the participants followed by television (43.41%). Mothers exposed to mass media were more likely to attending antenatal visits [Odds ratio (OR) 6.28; 95% CI (1.01-38.99)], taking rest and sleep during pregnancy [OR 2.65; 95% CI (1.13-6.26)], and receiving TT immunization [OR 5.12; 95% CI (1.23-21.24)] than their non-exposed counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS: The study reported a positive influence of mass media on the utilisation of antenatal care services in Nepal. Therefore, further emphasis should be given to increase awareness of women of rural Nepal through mass media to improve utilisation of antenatal care services in Nepal.

N2  - Background: Although under-five mortality rate seems to be declining in Ghana, the northern part of the country has higher levels of under-five mortality vis-à-vis the national rates. This research examines the correlates of the high under-five mortality among children in the northern part of Ghana, with emphasis on the usage of insecticide-treated bed net (ITN), as recommended by the World Health Organization. Methods: A total of 3,839 under-five children sourced from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey - was used for this study. Univariate descriptive statistics was employed to describe the variables used for the empirical estimation. The maximum likelihood estimation technique was used to estimate a logit model in other to determine the effect of insecticide treated bed net usage on under-five mortality. Results: Insecticide-treated bed net usage among children enhances their survival rates. Thus, under-five mortality among children who sleep under treated bed nets is about 18.8% lower than among children who do not sleep under treated bed nets. While health facility delivery was found to reduce to reduce under-five mortality, child bearing among older women is detrimental to the survival of the child. Conclusions: The study, therefore, recommends that policies targeting reduction in under-five mortality in northern Ghana should consider not mere availability of ITNs in the household, but advocate the usage of these treated nets. The study recommends to the Ministry of Health to extend their services to unreached rural communities to encourage health facility delivery to reduce under-five mortality.

N2  - This article is part of a Special Issue "Estradiol and cognition". Subjective changes in concentration and memory are commonly reported by women during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy, but the nature of the problem is poorly understood. We hypothesized that these self-reports might reflect difficulties in working memory (WM). It was further hypothesized that antepartum depression (depression arising during pregnancy) may play an etiological role, either on its own or due to secondary changes in endocrine function or sleep. Using WM tasks that emphasized executive control processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) we compared pregnant women tested at 34-36. weeks of gestation (n= 28) with age- and education-matched non-pregnant controls (n= 26). All pregnant women were screened for depression. Evidence of a WM disturbance was found, and was evident only among pregnant women showing depressive symptoms. In contrast, pregnant women who were not depressed showed WM performance that equalled, or even significantly exceeded, non-pregnant controls. No significant differences were observed on control tests of other cognitive functions. Multiple regression revealed that serum estradiol concentrations, along with severity of depressive affect but not sleep disruption, significantly predicted variation in the WM scores. In agreement with studies of estradiol and WM in other contexts, higher estradiol was associated with better WM, while higher levels of depressive symptoms predicted poorer WM. We conclude that memory disturbance during gestation might not be as widespread as commonly believed, but can be seen among women experiencing antepartum depression. The high level of WM performance found in healthy, non-depressed, pregnant women is discussed from an adaptationist perspective.

N2  - Background: Blood pressure (BP) has a circadian rhythm, decreases at night and increases in the morning (dipper), have been observed in patients with impaired in this profile, increased at night and lower in the morning (no dipper) have increased cardiovascular risk. Preeclampsia-eclampsia complicates about 7% of pregnancies, preeclampsia is known to reverse the normal circadian cycle of the BP. Objective: To determine the profile dipper / non-dipper in patients with severe pre-eclampsia, eclampsia and HELLP syndrome patients in Intensive Care and Obstetrics Hospital Juárez of México. Material and methods: 15 patients were reviewed, 10 with severe preeclampsia, 4 with HELLP syndrome and 1 eclampsia, systolic, diastolic, mean and pulse PA were analyzed during the day / night and pregnancy / postpartum. Using ratios pregnancy day / night pregnancy, puerperium day / night postpartum dipper / non-dipper profile is determined Results: Maternal age 30 ± 6.34 years, 7 primiparous (46%) 8 multiparous (54%), pregnancy was 31.67 ± 4.59 weeks. In all but two results in the ratio of pulse pressure during pregnancy was not the result dipper raiser and did not change during the postpartum period. Conclusion: in all patients during pregnancy profile was observed no dipper no change during the postpartum period. The established treatment did not modify this result. So it is appropriate to establish strategies to change this behavior and try to get the patient to regain normal circadian BP rhythm.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS)/Willis-Ekbom disease (WED) is common during pregnancy, affecting approximately one in five pregnant women in Western countries. Many report moderate or severe symptoms and negative impact on sleep. There is very little information in the medical literature for practitioners on the management of this condition during pregnancy. Accordingly, a task force was chosen by the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. A committee of nine experts in RLS/WED and/or obstetrics developed a set of 12 consensus questions, conducted a literature search, and extensively discussed potential guidelines. Recommendations were approved by the IRLSSG executive committee, reviewed by IRLSSG membership, and approved by the WED Foundation Medical Advisory Board. These guidelines address diagnosis, differential diagnosis, clinical course, and severity assessment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. Nonpharmacologic approaches, including reassurance, exercise and avoidance of exacerbating factors, are outlined. A rationale for iron supplementation is presented. Medications for RLS/WED are risk/benefit rated for use during pregnancy and lactation. A few are rated "may be considered" when RLS/WED is refractory to more conservative approaches. An algorithm summarizes the recommendations. These guidelines are intended to improve clinical practice and promote further research.

N2  - Sleep and sleep disturbances are increasingly recognized as determinants of women's health and well-being, particularly in the context of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. At present, however, little is known about whether fertility is affected by sleep quantity and quality. That is, to what degree, and by what mechanisms, do sleep and/or its disturbances affect fertility? The purpose of this review is to synthesize what is known about sleep disturbances in relation to reproductive capacity. A model is provided, whereby stress, sleep dysregulation, and circadian misalignment are delineated for their potential relevance to infertility. Ultimately, if it is the case that sleep disturbance is associated with infertility, new avenues for clinical intervention may be possible.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a chronic movement disorder, characterized by an urge to move legs usually accompanied by uncomfortable sensations and sleep disorders. The prevalence of the syndrome ranges from 1% to 15% in the general population, and about 2% during childhood. RLS is the most common movement disorder in pregnancy. However RLS still remains under-diagnosed probably due to lack of accurate information about the disease. Family history is positive in 50-70% of the primary RLS patients. The secondary form of the syndrome is associated with iron deficiency, renal failure, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus and many rheumatologic disorders. Secondary forms generally manifest at older ages and have a rapid progression with a poorer prognosis. The pathophysiology of RLS is focused on the dopaminergic system, reduced central nervous system iron levels and genetic linkages. Diagnosis is based on clinical features and the diagnostic criteria suggested by International RLS Study Group. Secondary causes must be carefully investigated before the treatment. In mild forms of the disease non-pharmacologic therapies might be useful, while in moderate or severe forms of the disease generally pharmacologic therapies such as dopamine agonists, anticonvulsants, opioids and benzodiazepines are required.

N2  - Respiratory muscles including diaphragm constitute the ventilatory pump on which the act of breathing depends. In most neuromuscular disorders, there is simultaneous respiratory muscle weakness of similar or even greater extent than to other skeletal muscles. Causes of neuromuscular weakness: cerebral cortex-stroke, seizure disorders, degeneration, neoplasm; brainstem/basal ganglia-stroke, postpolio syndrome, progressive bulbar palsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis; spinal cord-trauma, demyelinating disease, disk compression, multiple sclerosis; anterior horn cells-motor neuron disease, postpolio syndrome, amyotrophic lateral; neuromuscular junction myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, drugs (steroids, AChE sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, primary lateral sclerosis inhibitors); myopathies muscular dystrophies, glycogen storage disease, polymyositis, dernatomyositis, other myopathies. Major respirator problems in patients with neuromuscular disease: pneumonia-aspiration; diurnal ventilation failure; sleep disordered breathing. Aspiration pneumonia-Caused by oropharyngeal muscle weakness, gastric reflux, and cough insufficiency. Aspiration risk factors: Head-end elevation <30°, use of sedatives/opioids, low Glasgow Coma Scale score, that is, <9, gastric residual volume (>200 cm3), gastroesophageal reflux/vomiting. Diurnal ventilatory failure: Respiratory symptoms are often initially absent or minimal because of the large reserve of the respiratory system. Respiratory muscle involvement may also be masked because patients with skeletal muscle weakness spontaneously decrease their overall activity level, thereby reducing the daily physiologic challenge faced by the respiratory system. For all these reasons, it is not unusual for respiratory muscle weakness to go undetected until overt respiratory failure is precipitated by an acute episode of pulmonary aspiration or infection. Evaluation. Symptoms and signs-unexplained dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, recurrent cough, choking; objective tests; nocturnal pulse oximetry; forced vital capacity (FVC); sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP); arterial blood gases. Treatment. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)-indications: acute respiratory failure secondary to chest infection, perioperative support/ peg tube placement, hypercapnic chronic respiratory failure, sleep-disordered breathing, during pregnancy, palliate symptoms. Long-term ventilation-tracheostomy care (TRACHE): tape-keep tube position secured; resuscitation- know the resuscitation process; airway clear-use correct suction technique; care of the site-care of stoma and neck; humidity-essential to keep tube clear; emergency kit-have the kit ready. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with neuromuscular disorders: Higher incidence of OSA in patients with neuromuscular disease; need high index of suspicion for OSA in these patients; polysomnography (PSG) is the test of choice for diagnosis of OSA; NIPPV (CPAP/bilevel) is recommended if PSG is positive for OSA.

N2  - Systemic maternal inflammation is implicated in preterm birth and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and may induce morbidities including reduced pulmonary function, sleep-disordered breathing, and cardiovascular disorders. Here we test the hypothesis that antenatal maternal inflammation per se causes altered alveolar development and increased chemoreflex sensitivity that persists beyond infancy. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (150 μg/kg ip) to induce maternal inflammation or saline (SHAM) at embryonic day 16 (randomized). Pups were weighed daily. On days 7, 28, and 60 (D07, D28, and D60), unrestrained wholebody plethysmography quantified ventilation and chemoreflex responses to hypoxia (10%), hypercapnia (7%), and asphyxia (hypoxic hypercapnia). Lungs were harvested to quantify alveolar number, size, and septal thickness. LPS pups had reduced baseline ventilation per unit bodyweight (∼40%, P < 0.001) vs. SHAM. LPS increased ventilatory responses to hypoxia (D07: 66% vs. 28% increase in ventilation; P < 0.001) hypercapnia (170% vs. 88%; P < 0.001), and asphyxia (249% vs. 154%; P < 0.001); hypersensitive hypoxic responsiveness persisted until D60 (P < 0.001). LPS also increased apnea frequency (P < 0.01). LPS caused thicker alveolar septae (D07, P < 0.001), diminished alveolar number (D28, P < 0.001) vs. SHAM, but effects were minimal by D60. Pups delivered from mothers exposed to antenatal inflammation exhibit deficits in lung structure and hypersensitive responses to respiratory stimuli that persist beyond the newborn period. Antenatal inflammation may contribute to impaired gas exchange and unstable breathing in newborn infants and adversely affect long-term health.

N2  - Diazepam is often considered the prototypical benzodiazepine and the “grandfather” of the drug class; It is a reliable agent for treating stress and anxiety in adults. Dental patients with generalized anxiety, belonephobia (fear of needles and sharp instruments), prior dental trauma, or generalized fear of the dentist can take diazepam in order to reduce their anxieties. A variety of single and incremental dose protocols are used to medicate the patient as early as the day before treatment. It also can be taken 1 hour before the procedure. Medication additionally helps reduce memory or the sights and smells of the dental office to avoid recall of any trauma. This medication belongs to a class called benzodiazepines which act on the brain and nerves to produce a calming effect. It works by enhancing the effects of a certain natural chemical in the body (GABA).Diazepam also can be given through a vein in the arm for conscious sedation. When given by mouth, diazepam is very safe. But it does often cause side effects, including, forgetfulness, impaired thinking. Certain groups of people should not take diazepam, they are people with narrow-angle glaucoma,people with sleep apnea, pregnant women. It should be administered only by people with advanced training in anesthesiology.

N2  - Objective: This study was aimed to identify the physical and mental state of women after delivery, to investigate the factors that influence those, and to examine the effects of postpartum care performance, which is traditionally believed to be appropriate care in Korea, on women's physical and mental status. Materials and Methods: A total of 148 women who visited our hospital for postpartum check-up on the 2nd week or 6th week after delivery were selected. We researched postpartum care methods using a questionnaire and had the women self-evaluate their postpartum symptoms. Depression was evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory. Results: The average points of the 27 postpartum symptoms was 2.70 points (from 1 = very good to 5 = very bad). Seventy-two women had depression. Factors related to postpartum symptoms and depression were smoking before pregnancy, low marital satisfaction, bad mood during and after pregnancy, lack of support from husbands, and bad quality of sleep during puerperium. Treating the joints of hands carefully when milking breasts, and avoiding squatting down, demonstrated a negative correlation with the average points of postpartum symptoms. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that mood during puerperium and Beck Depression Inventory points were significant factors related to the average points of postpartum symptoms and that the degree of support from husbands and mood during pregnancy were statistically related with depression. Conclusion: Many women complained of postpartum discomfort. Although, while some postpartum care methods which are traditionally believed to be appropriate care in Korea can be helpful to women's recovery, most of them are not. We confirmed that physical symptoms and depression are closely related to each other.

N2  - Background: Breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of becoming overweight or obese later in life. Breastfed babies grow more slowly during infancy than formula-fed babies. Among offspring exposed in utero to maternal glucose intolerance, prospective data on growth during infancy have been unavailable. Thus, scientific evidence is insufficient to conclude that breastfeeding reduces the risk of obesity among the offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM). To address this gap, we devised the Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after GDM Pregnancy and Growth of their Offspring, also known as the SWIFT Offspring Study. This prospective, longitudinal study recruited mother-infant pairs from the SWIFT Study, a prospective study of women with recent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The goal of the SWIFT Offspring Study is to determine whether breastfeeding intensity and duration, compared with formula feeding, are related to slower growth of GDM offspring during the first year life. This article details the study design, participant eligibility, data collection, and methodologies. We also describe the baseline characteristics of the GDM mother-infant pairs. Methods: The study enrolled 466 mother-infant pairs among GDM deliveries in northern California from 2009-2011. Participants attended three in-person study exams at 6-9 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after delivery for infant anthropometry (head circumference, body weight, length, abdominal circumference and skinfold thicknesses), as well as maternal anthropometry (body weight, waist circumference and percent body fat). Mothers also completed questionnaires on health and lifestyle behaviors, including infant diet, sleep and temperament. Breastfeeding intensity and duration were assessed via several sources (diaries, telephone interviews, monthly mailings and in-person exams) from birth through the first year of life. Pregnancy course, clinical perinatal and newborn outcomes were obtained from health plan electronic medical records. Infant saliva samples were collected and stored for genetics studies. Discussion: This large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of GDM offspring will enable evaluation of the relationship of infant feeding to growth during infancy independent of perinatal characteristics, sociodemographics and other risk factors. The longitudinal design provides the first quantitative measures of breastfeeding intensity and duration among GDM offspring during early life.

N2  - Background: Overweight and obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, respectively are increasingly common among women of reproductive age. Overweight and obesity are known to be associated with many adverse health conditions in the preconception period, during pregnancy and during the labour and postpartum period. There are no current guidelines to suggest which preconception health programs and interventions are of benefit to these women and their infants. It is important to evaluate the available evidence to establish which preconception interventions are of value to this population of women. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions for improving pregnancy outcomes in overweight and obese women. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (including those using a cluster-randomised design), comparing health programs and interventions with routine care in women of reproductive age and a BMI greater then or equal to 25 kg/m2. Studies published in abstract form only, were not eligible for inclusion. Quasi-randomised trials or randomised trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion in this review. The intervention in such studies would involve an assessment of preconception health and lead to an individualised preconception program addressing any areas of concern for that particular woman. Preconception interventions could involve any or all of: provision of specific information, screening for and treating obesity-related health problems, customised or general dietary and exercise advice, medical or surgical interventions. Medical interventions may include treatment of pre-existing hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance or sleep apnoea. Surgical interventions may include interventions such as bariatric surgery. The comparator was prespecified to be standard preconception advice or no advice/interventions. Data collection and analysis: We identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. The search identified one study (published in four trial reports) which was independently assessed by two review authors and subsequently excluded. Main results: There are no included trials. Authors' conclusions: We found no randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of preconception health programs and interventions in overweight and obese women with the aim of improving pregnancy outcomes. Until the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions can be established, no practice recommendations can be made. Further research is required in this area.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Young adulthood is a critical life period for health and health behaviours. Related measurements collected before and after birth, and during childhood and adolescence can provide a life-course analysis of important factors that contribute to health and behaviour in young adulthood. The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study has collected a large number of such measurements during the fetal, perinatal, infancy, childhood and adolescence periods and plans to relate them to common health issues and behaviours in young adults, including spinal pain, asthma, sleep disorders, physical activity and sedentary behaviour and, work absenteeism and presenteeism. The aim of this paper is to describe the rationale, design and methods of the 22 year follow-up of the Raine Study cohort.
METHODS/DESIGN: The Raine Study is a prospective cohort study. Participants still active in the cohort (n = 2,086) were contacted around the time of their 22nd birthday and invited to participate in the 22 year follow-up. Each was asked to complete a questionnaire, attend a research facility for physical assessment and an overnight sleep study, wear activity monitors for a week, and to maintain a sleep and activity diary over this week. The questionnaire was broad and included questions related to sociodemographics, medical history, quality of life, psychological factors, lifestyle factors, spinal pain, respiratory, sleep, activity and work factors. Physical assessments included anthropometry, blood pressure, back muscle endurance, tissue sensitivity, lung function, airway reactivity, allergic status, 3D facial photographs, cognitive function, and overnight polysomnography.
DISCUSSION: Describing the prevalence of these health issues and behaviours in young adulthood will enable better recognition of the issues and planning of health care resources. Providing a detailed description of the phenotype of these issues will provide valuable information to help educate health professionals of the needs of young adults. Understanding the life-course risk factors of health issues and behaviours in young adulthood will have important health planning implications, supporting the development of targeted interventions to improve current health status and reduce the onset and development of further ill-health across adulthood.

N2  - Good sleep is an essential component to health and wellbeing. It consumes one third of human existence; unhealthy sleep can severely impair the other two-thirds. An increasing amount of data now shows that poor sleep - such as sleep disordered breathing, poor sleep quality, and insomnia - has a negative impact on pregnancy outcomes [1-5]. Indeed, over half of the most important risk factors for stillbirth, such as maternal hypertension, gestational diabetes, and fetal growth restriction, have been shown to be associated with maternal sleep disruption [1,2,6-9]. Findings from recent studies have also suggested that maternal sleep position may be a risk factor for stillbirth [10,11]. It has long been recognized that posture in late pregnancy can have a profound effect on maternal hemodynamics. Studies in awake pregnant women have demonstrated reduced ejection fraction and cardiac output in the supine position compared to the left lateral position [12] that may reduce utero-placental blood flow to the fetus since the gravid uterus compresses the inferior vena cava. Failure to prevent this compression can lead to maternal supine hypotensive syndrome [13] and to an adverse effect on umbilical artery blood flow and gas exchange between mother and fetus, with consequent fetal heart rate decelerations [14] and fetal growth restriction [15]. For over 60 years it has been standard of care to place laboring pregnant women in the left lateral tilt position to displace the uterus from the inferior vena cava and improve maternal hemodynamics. Despite this knowledge, little attention has been paid to maternal sleep position during pregnancy even though we spend about one third of our life asleep. Given the known effects of inferior vena cava compression it is very possible that supine sleep could be a risk for stillbirth. Recent studies in Auckland, New Zealand [10], and Ghana, Africa [11] have both shown that supine sleep is independently associated with stillbirth; indeed Owusu et al [11] found that the effect of supine sleep on stillbirth was mediated via low birth weight. Both of the latter studies suggested that if supine sleep plays a causal role in stillbirth, altering the sleep position of pregnant women may reduce stillbirth by approximately 25%. Of note, we have recently demonstrated that the majority of pregnant women (about 80%) spend some time sleeping supine, with the median time being approximately one quarter of the night [16]. Supine sleep may therefore represent a maternal stressor in the unexplained late stillbirth triple risk model [17]. Thus, if supine sleep plays a role in stillbirth, the majority of pregnant women would benefit from education and potential intervention. Several potential methods to reduce supine sleep include the use of mattress wedges or pillows [18] or other interventions such as the 'tennis ball' technique [19] or even novel devices that could alert a pregnant women to change position. However, before intervention studies are launched, it is pertinent that the findings regarding sleep position are repeated and confirmed in other studies; several such studies are currently underway including small studies monitoring the fetus during maternal sleep (O'Brien and Warland, personal communication) and large studies such as the MiNESS study in the UK [20] that will either support or refute the sleep position hypothesis.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: to explore gestational weight gain in healthy women in relation to pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index, diet and physical activity.
DESIGN: a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 455 healthy pregnant women of all gestational ages receiving antenatal care from an independent midwife in the Netherlands. Weight gain was assessed using the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines and classified as below, within, or above the guidelines. A multinomial regression analysis was performed with weight gain classifications as the dependent variable (within IOM-guidelines as reference). Independent variables were pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index, diet (broken down into consumption of vegetables, fruit and fish) and physical activity (motivation to engage in physical activity, pre-pregnancy physical activity and decline in physical activity during pregnancy). Covariates were age, gestational age, parity, ethnicity, family income, education, perceived sleep deprivation, satisfaction with pre-pregnancy weight, estimated prepregnancy body mass index, smoking, having a weight gain goal and having received weight gain advice from the midwife.
FINDINGS: forty-two per cent of the women surveyed gained weight within the guidelines. Fourteen per cent of the women gained weight below the guidelines and 44 per cent gained weight above the guidelines. Weight gain within the guidelines, compared to both above and below the guidelines, was not associated with pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index nor with diet. A decline in physical activity was associated with weight gain above the guidelines (OR 0.54, 95 per cent CI 0.33-0.89). Weight gain below the guidelines was seen more often in women who perceived a greater sleep deprivation (OR 1.20, 95 per cent CI 1.02-1.41). Weight gain above the guidelines was seen less often in Caucasian women in comparison to non-Caucasian women (OR 0.22, 95 per cent CI 0.08-0.56) and with women who did not stop smoking during pregnancy (OR 0.49, 95 per cent CI 0.25-0.95).
KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: a decline in physical activity was the only modifiable factor in our population associated with weight gain above the gain recommended by the guidelines. Prevention of reduced physical activity during pregnancy seems a promising approach to promoting healthy weight gain. Interventions to promote healthy weight gain should focus on all women, regardless of pre-pregnancy body mass index.

N2  - The Auckland Stillbirth Study, a prospective population-based case control study, was the first study to report maternal sleep related practices as risk factors for stillbirth [1]. In brief there were 155 women with a singleton late stillbirth (at or greater than 28 weeks' gestation) without congenital abnormality, born between July 2006 and June 2009 and booked to deliver in Auckland. They were compared with 310 women with single ongoing pregnancies and gestation matched to that at which the stillbirth occurred. The prevalence of late stillbirth in this study was 3.09/ 1000 births. No relationship was found between snoring or day time sleepiness and risk of late stillbirth. However, women who slept on their back or on their right side on the last night (prior to stillbirth or interview) were more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared to women who slept on their left side (back: aOR 2.54; 95% CI: 1.04 to 6.18; and right side: aOR 1.74; 95% CI: 0.98 to 3.01). Women who got up to the toilet once or less on the last night were more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared to women who got up more frequently (aOR 2.28; 95% CI: 1.40 to 3.71). Women who regularly slept during the day, in the last month, were also more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared to those who did not (aOR 2.03; 95% CI 1.26 to 3.27). If maternal sleeping position is causally related to stillbirth then 37% of stillbirths might be prevented if mothers slept on their left side. However, the authors urged caution as this was the first time that an association has been described between maternal sleep practices and late stillbirth risk. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute these findings before public health interventions are launched. In New Zealand there is a multicentre case-control study, which began in 2012, led by Lesley McCowan, and in England there is the Midland and North of England Stillbirth Study (MiNESS), which began in 2014, led by Alex Heazell [2]. Despite urging caution, midwives appear to have accepted the findings and are advising their patients to sleep on the left side. This has resulted in a significant increase in left sided sleep position, from 35.9% in The Auckland Stillbirth Study (2006-9) to 62.5% in late 2011 (unpublished findings). This has been associated with a reduction in late stillbirth for New Zealand (excluding congenital abnormalities and multiple pregnancies). 2007 184. 2008 187. 2009 205. 2010 162. 2011 146. 2012 136. Although we cannot exclude other reasons for the decline, it is tempting to believe that the declined is a consequence of more pregnant women sleeping on their left.

N2  - The previous Stillbirth Summit presented by the Star Legacy Foundation and supported by various organisations was held in October 2011 in Minneapolis to discuss emerging ideas in the field of stillbirth research and management. In particular the focus was on the placenta, cord, infection and inflammation, reduced fetal movements and maternal sleep. Attendees were invited researchers, stillbirth advocates and parents. One of the strengths of the meeting was the robust debate amongst the researchers, alongside the energy and passion of the parents. Unlike some scientific meetings which are talkfest, the Summit in 2011 had tangible outcomes. The first of which was that the majority of the researchers summarised their presentations, which were published in the BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, which is an open access journal allowing anyone to access the content online [1]. Several important collaborations developed. Jane Warland and Ed Mitchell had independently developed conceptual models for the mechanism of stillbirths, which were adapted from the SIDS triple risk model. These authors collaborated in developing their ideas further and this has been recently published [2]. In 2011 Tomasina Stacey summarised the findings from The Auckland Stillbirth Study, a case-control study, which identified maternal non-left position on going to sleep was associated with a two fold increase risk of late stillbirths. The researchers urged caution and identified the need for robust, peer reviewed supporting evidence before recommending change or public health campaigns. Alex Heazell took up the challenge and with the support of the Auckland group has developed the Midland and North of England Stillbirth Study (MiNESS), which is funded by Action Medical Research and Cure Kids [3]. The most notable outcome was the development of the STARS Study, led by Louise O'Brien and Jane Warland, and supported by the Star Legacy Foundation. In essence this is an internet survey of women who had lost a baby in late pregnancy (28+ weeks gestation). There were two components, the first was women who had lost their baby more than 3 weeks prior to completing the survey. “The experiences of 1310 mothers of late stillbirths” was presented at the Stillbirth Summit 2014 by Jane Warland. The second component was a case-control study. The cases are mothers who had a late stillbirth less than 3 weeks prior to completing the interview. They are compared with women who had live ongoing pregnancies also at 28+ weeks gestation. The survey was extensive covering a wide range of issues. Recruitment has been difficult and the expected number of cases and controls are less than expected. Ed Mitchell presented interim findings from 132 cases and 283 controls. As these analyses were interim, the results are not presented here.

N2  - The scope of stillbirth has been overlooked by many, few would estimate that in high income countries that, late stillbirths (pregnancies 28 weeks or later) occurs twice as often as death due to HIV/ AIDS; ten times more common than deaths due to Hepatitis B; twice a common as deaths due to congenital anomalies; twice as common as deaths due to preterm complications, and ten times more common that Sudden Infant Deaths (SIDS) [1]. Perinatal audit is the key to identifying potentially modifiable factors that contribute to stillbirth: higher than expected intrapartum deaths should trigger a review of labor and delivery procedures; higher than expected number of losses of multiples should trigger a review of advanced reproductive technologies services [2]. Stillbirth prevention strategies in developed countries do share some similarities to those in developing countries, for example ensuring that poor and less educated women have access to contraception, timely access to good prenatal care. The most demonstrable effect of early prenatal care is the accurate dating of the pregnancy, screening for infection and the prenatal screening for chromosomal and congenital anomalies. In a setting where there is the availability of abortion for affected pregnancies, the number of stillbirths related to anomalies can be reduced significantly [3]. Suboptimal care has been shown to occur in 10 to 60% of stillbirths in developed countries [2]. The most common errors are failure to identify emerging clinical disorders, (such as fetal growth restriction), failure to use up-dated “best practice protocols”, poor communication or non-compliance of the members of the team (including those responsible to follow up with patients when appointments are missed). By focusing some light on the problem of stillbirth there has evolved a number of new and potentially helpful observations. The appreciation that advanced maternal age, racial minority (specifically within the United States non-Hispanic black status), and severe obesity all are associated with an increased risk of stillbirth after 39 weeks of gestation, providers have the opportunity to either increase fetal surveillance or offer induction, thus treating these women as post-dates sooner than their low risk peers. A program of increasing awareness of the importance of fetal movement as well as the optimal management of decreased fetal movement has been shown to reduce the overall stillbirth rate by 30%. [4]. Other interesting recent observations that may modify stillbirth risk are that that the habit of left-lying during sleep may reduce the risk of late pregnancy [5]; that significant maternal stress has been associated with and increased risk of stillbirth [6], and that the evolution of genetic testing to include the evaluation of microarrays (which detects a single-nucleotide polymorphism or duplications or deletions of 500kb or greater) is more sensitive than standard karyotype to a detect potential cause of stillbirth [7]. Hopefully with on-going research we will develop a greater understanding of the elephant in the room and fewer parents will end up in the “stillbirth club”.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: A number of studies have established an association between antenatal maternal depression and infant sleep. One key question is whether all infants are equally susceptible to environmental influences, including the intrauterine environment. Reactive temperament has been examined as a plasticity factor, with accumulating evidence suggesting that infants with reactive temperament may be more susceptible to both positive and negative environmental influences. This study examines whether infant reactivity moderates any association between antenatal depression and infant sleep in 2 longitudinal studies: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and Generation R cohorts.
METHODS: Maternal depression scores were assessed during pregnancy using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Brief Symptom Inventory. Infant sleep duration and awakenings, in ALSPAC (N = 8318) and Generation R (N = 2241), were assessed at 18 and 24 months of age, respectively. Infant reactivity was assessed by temperament questionnaire at 6 months of age.
RESULTS: Hierarchical linear regression models indicated a 3-way interaction between reactivity and gender moderating the effect of antenatal depression on infant sleep, on sleep duration in Generation R at 24 months (β = .085, p < .001) in the whole sample and when limited to the Dutch/European group (β = .055, p = .030), and on night awakenings at 18 months in ALSPAC (β = -.085, p = .013). Boys with more reactive temperament exhibited shorter sleep duration and a higher number of awakenings when previously exposed to maternal symptoms of antenatal depression.
CONCLUSION: For the first time, these findings highlight, in 2 large cohorts, that children with temperamental reactivity may be more vulnerable to antenatal depression, raising the possibility of targeted interventions to improve infant outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare self-reported safe sleep data from a community social service agency and primary care centers.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)-based survey data from a community social service agency and survey data from primary care centers were compared using descriptive statistics. There were 166 community survey respondents, average age of 25 years (SD = 5.4 years), and 79 primary care center respondents, average age of 24 years (SD = 5.4 years). Two binary logistic regressions were performed to examine the association between demographic differences and safe sleep position/bed sharing.
RESULTS: Safe sleep position responses did not differ significantly between the community-based (n = 126, 85%) and primary care center-based (n = 62, 79%) samples, χ(2)(1) = 0.79, P = .372. Reported bed sharing was significantly higher in the community sample (n = 54, 36%) than the health care center sample (n = 4, 5%), Fisher's exact test, P< .001. Black race was determined to be significantly associated with increased unsafe sleep positioning (OR = 2.86, P = .022). The community center cohort was the only significant predictor of bed sharing (OR = 25.40, P = .002).
CONCLUSION: Differences in reported safe sleep environments may be due to knowledge variances of safe sleep guidelines, or clinic-based respondents may have been more likely to provide socially desirable responses. The comparison data further highlight the need for continued targeted effort to improve safe sleep behaviors to improve infant health outcomes.

N2  - Background: Low birth weight (LBW) constitutes a major public health problem, both in developed than in developing countries, due to its extent and its strong association with childhood morbidity and mortality. Objective: to estimate prevalence of low birth weight and determine its related factors in the Prefectoral Hospital in Mohammedia. Methods: We carried out a cross sectional study from May to July 2012 which concerned 713 newborns and theirs mothers. We collected information about socioeconomic and anthropometric factors and characteristics of pregnancy. A multivariate analysis was performed. Results: Among the 713 studied newborns, 38 had LBW; the prevalence of LBW was 5,3% (95% CI: 3,7% - 6,9%). Factors significantly associated with LBW in multivariate analysis were: mother age (OR 9,27 ; IC95% : 2,15-39,85), prematurity (OR 9,34 ; IC95% : 1,29-67,32), twin pregnancy (OR 195,07 ; IC 95% : 30,38- 125,39) and gender of new born (OR 5,26 ; IC 95% : 1,61-17,18). Well-balanced diet (OR 0,12 ; IC 95% : 0,04-0,34) and hours of sleep equal or more than 8 per day (OR 0,20 ; IC 95% : 0,07-0,58) were protector factors. Conclusion: Actions of education, screening and treatment of the diseases occurred in the pregnancy are necessary. Facilitating the access of pregnant women to high quality antenatal care, promoting a healthy lifestyle as a balanced diet, fighting against the active and passive smoking and offering a psychological support to the pregnant woman is necessary to reduce the prevalence of LBW and to improve the maternal and child health.

N2  - Background: Nitric oxide (NO) is widely implicated in the modification of the sleep-wake states and, in obstructive sleep apnea, decreased NO levels have been implicated as possible mechanisms for development of cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have shown that sleep disorders are prevalent in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, and it is well known that NO plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of this disease. Aims: The aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between NO and sleep disorders in a group of SCD patients. Methods: Steady-state adult patients with SCD followed at Ambulatory of Hereditary Anemias from Escola Paulista de Medicina/UNIFESP were invited to this study. Exclusion criteria were: chronic blood transfusion, pregnancy, and vaso-occlusive episodes and transfusion in the last three months. Sleep disorders were evaluated by standard overnight multichannel polysomnography (Somnologica, EmblaTM). NO plasma samples were determined by chemiluminescence using Model 280 Nitric Oxide Analyzer (NOATM) from Sievers Instruments, Inc. (Boulder, CO, USA). This study was approved by Ethical Committee, and all patients agreed to participate. Results: 64 consecutive patients were enrolled, 33 (51.6%) males, with median (range) age of 28 (19-60) years. 42 (65.6%) had sickle cell anemia in use of hydroxyurea (SS-HU), 13 (20.3%) SS without HU, and 9 (14.1%) SC disease. The NO median concentration was 71.75 uM (40.5-243.5), with no difference among SS-HU, SS and SC patients (P=0.40). According with median level of NO, the patients were divided in two groups: G1 ≤71.75 and G2 >71.75uM. Among the sleep parameters analyzed, only two showed significant difference when compared G1 with G2: AHI - apnea-hypopnea index: 3.1(0-43.2) vs. 0.8 (0-10.4) (P=0.008), and DI - desaturation index: 5.1 (0-106.3) vs. 3.3 (0-29.9) (P=0.011). Considering the normal values of AHI and DI (≤5 and ≤10, respectively), we found association between lower levels of NO and AHI (OR=5.05, 95%CI: 1.25-20.43, P=0.03), and between lower levels of NO and DI (OR=3.81, 95% CI: 1.04-13.95, P=0.07). Summary and Conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is, probably, the most known sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). It is a multifactorial process that leads not only to chronic intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, but also to increased cardiovascular morbidity. NO plays a contributory role in the pathophysiology of this process. Interestingly, SDB and SCD present many aspects in common, like chronic inflammatory status, endothelial dysfunction, and lower levels of NO. Moreover, SDB is prevalent in SCD and there is a relationship between NO level and SCD manifestations. The AHI and DI are important indexes related to SDB and risk of cardiovascular morbidity. The fact that we found both indexes altered in SCD, especially in patients with lower levels of NO, confirm that SCD patients suffered from sleep disturbances, and implies that NO is probably associated with it. This is one of the first studies about sleep disorders in adult patients with SCD, reinforcing the need of more studies in this field.

N2  - Fetal movement is an important biological index of fetal well-being. Since 2008, we have been developing an original capacitive acceleration sensor and device that a pregnant woman can easily use to record fetal movement by herself at home during sleep. In this study, we report a newly developed automated software system for analyzing recorded fetal movement. This study will introduce the system and compare its results to those of a manual analysis of the same fetal movement signals (Experiment I). We will also demonstrate an appropriate way to use the system (Experiment II). In Experiment I, fetal movement data reported previously for six pregnant women at 28-38 gestational weeks were used. We evaluated the agreement of the manual and automated analyses for the same 10-sec epochs using prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) including quantitative indicators for prevalence and bias. The mean PABAK value was 0.83, which can be considered almost perfect. In Experiment II, twelve pregnant women at 24-36 gestational weeks recorded fetal movement at night once every four weeks. Overall, mean fetal movement counts per hour during maternal sleep significantly decreased along with gestational weeks, though individual differences in fetal development were noted. This newly developed automated analysis system can provide important data throughout late pregnancy. Copyright:

N2  - Background: After cesarean section (CS), women may be at great risk for sleep disturbance, but little is known about temporal changes in their sleep patterns and characteristics. We had two aims: 1) to identify distinct classes of sleep-disturbance trajectories in women considering elective CS from third-trimester pregnancy to 6 months post-CS and 2) to examine associations of sleep trajectories with body mass index (BMI), depressive symptoms, and fatigue scores. Methods: We analyzed data from a prospective cohort study of 139 Taiwanese pregnant women who elected CS. Sleep components were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index in third-trimester pregnancy, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months post-CS. Data were collected on depressive symptoms, fatigue symptoms, and BMI. Sleep-quality trajectories were identified by group-based trajectory modeling. Results: We identified three distinct trajectories: stable poor sleep (50 women, 36.0%), progressively worse sleep (67 women, 48.2%), and persistently poor sleep (22 women, 15.8%). Poor sleep was significantly associated with pre-pregnancy BMI and more baseline (thirdtrimester pregnancy) depressive and fatigue symptoms. At 6 months post-CS, women classified as progressively worse or persistently poor sleepers showed a trend toward higher BMI (p<0.03), more depressive symptoms (p<0.001), and higher fatigue scores (p<0.001) than those with stable poor sleep. Conclusions: Women had three distinct sleep-disturbance trajectories before and after elective CS. These poor-sleep courses were associated with BMI and psychological well-being. Our findings suggest a need to continuously assess sleep quality among women considering elective CS and up to 6 months post-CS.

N2  - This longitudinal study aimed to compare static postural stability in women between early pregnancy, advanced pregnancy, and at 2 and 6 months postpartum. Forty-five pregnant women were enrolled and 31 completed the protocol. Data were collected at 7-16 and 34-39 weeks gestation, and at 6-10 and 26-30 weeks postpartum. For each subject, the center of foot pressure path length and mean velocity (with directional subcomponents) were computed from 30-s long quiet-standing trials on a stationary force plate with eyes open or closed. The body mass, stance width, and sleep duration within 24 h before testing were also recorded. Static postural stability was not different between pregnancy and postpartum, except for the anterior posterior sway tested in the eyes-closed condition, which was significantly increased in late pregnancy compared to that at 2 and 6 months postpartum. Pregnant/postpartum women's body mass weakly positively correlated with anterior-posterior sway in the eyes-closed condition and their stance width weakly positively correlated with the anterior-posterior sway in the eyes-open condition. No effect of sleep duration on postural sway was found. Our findings indicate that under visual deprivation conditions women in advanced pregnancy may have decreased static stability compared to their non-pregnant state.

N2  - Hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy, and studies show that pregnant women are more likely to suffer from restless legs syndrome (RLS). Pregnant women with hypertension and RLS often experience disrupted sleep patterns because of activation of the nervous system. The present study aimed to clarify the relationship between hypertension and RLS in pregnant women, and their impact on sleep. We enrolled 3,781 pregnant women who were admitted at our hospital for delivery between May 2011 and May 2014. The face-to-face questionnaire used to gather data included the International RLS Study Group criteria for diagnosis, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and hypertension diagnosis. Depending on the time of occurrence of hypertension, it was divided into two different types: pregnancy-induced hypertension and chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Out of 3,781 patients, 453 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for RLS and 486 met the diagnostic criteria for hypertension. Among patients with RLS, prophylactic iron supplementation was less frequently taken during pregnancy. Pregnancy-induced hypertension, rather than chronic hypertension in pregnancy, was found to be more frequent in patients with RLS; pregnant women with RLS had higher PSQI and ESS scores than pregnant controls. In our study, RLS was frequent in pregnant women, especially in those without prophylactic iron supplementation. Patients with RLS described more serious sleep disruption and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). In addition, pregnancy-induced hypertension was more common in patients with RLS.

N2  - Background: Sleep problems are common during pregnancy and in the postnatal period, but there is still a lack of longitudinal population-based studies assessing the quantity and quality of sleep in these women. The aim of the current study was to examine the natural development and stability of insomnia and short sleep duration in women from pregnancy to two years postpartum. Methods: This was a longitudinal cohort study (the Akershus Birth Cohort Study) of 1480 healthy women, who completed three comprehensive health surveys, at week 32 of pregnancy, week 8 postpartum and year 2 postpartum. The survey was composed of the following validated questionnaires: the Bergen Insomnia Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Differences in sleep characteristics between the three assessment points were compared using Analyses of Variance with repeated measures, and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the stability of sleep variables. Results: One thousand four hundred and eighty women completed all three surveys, and the mean age at birth was 30.7 (+/-4.9). The prevalence of insomnia remained stable at 60 % at the first two time periods, and remained high at 41 % at year 2 postpartum. The mean sleep duration at the three time periods was 7 h 16 min, 6 h 31 min, and 6 h 52 min, respectively. Concurrent maternal depression could not explain the stability of sleep problems from during and immediately after pregnancy, to sleep problems 2 years postpartum. Conclusion: Both insomnia and short sleep duration were found to be very common both before and after pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: The primary aim of this study was to determine if women with a history of mood disorders show greater objective or subjective circadian rhythm and sleep disruption from pregnancy to postpartum, as compared to healthy controls. Methods: Nineteen women (11 healthy controls, 8 with a history of major depressive or bipolar disorder) have been enrolled in this cohort study. All women were euthymic at initial assessment. The study includes two visits: one during the third trimester of pregnancy (<26 weeks gestation) and one during the postpartum period (6-12 weeks). At each visit, participants completed the subjective Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires, as well as were fitted with an actigraph (Respironics) to objectively measure their sleep and the circadian rhythmicity of their activity for a period of 3 weeks. Results: Analysis of subjective BRIAN and PSQI scores revealed that women with history of mood disorders showed greater disruption in circadian rhythms and sleep both during pregnancy and the postpartum period in comparison to controls (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). Likewise, analysis of sleep variables revealed that women with mood disorders have a lower sleep efficiency during pregnancy (p = 0.04) and postpartum (p = 0.01), with marginally lower total sleep time (p = 0.07). Finally, cosinor analysis of the actigraphy data also revealed that women with mood disorders showed marginally significant differences in their mesor (i.e. difference in mean activity) (p = 0.056) and amplitude (i.e. difference in peak activity) (p = 0.0573). There was no group x time interaction on either subjective or objective measures. Conclusions: Previous studies have demonstrated that women with mood disorders show increased subjective sleep disruption during the perinatal period. However, studies aiming to determine if sleep disruption predicts postpartum depression have yielded mixed results. Here we show that subjective and objective parameters of circadian rhythms are persistently disrupted in women at risk for postpartum depression.

N2  - A Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) Italian National Registry has started (http:www.registronmd.it) with collection of clinical/genetic information (minimal dataset), reporting of clinical scales, and linkage with the international CMT Registry/Database. There is conflicting evidence in the CMT literature about five important issues: disease course and complications during pregnancy; use, efficacy and tolerability of orthotics and assistive devices; outcome of surgery for skeletal deformities; safety of anesthesia; occurrence of sleep disorders. We aim at collecting information on these five issues by using a web-based questionnaire panel, linked to the National Registry, administered to the Registry population, which is well-characterized and fairly representative. Both already validated and ad hoc developed questionnaires are used. We have developed four novel questionnaires with items generation and reduction by experts and patients: a questionnaire on pregnancy and delivery in CMT has been developed through two focus groups with patients and a psychologist, with the supervision of a gynecologist; three ad hoc questionnaires on orthotics and assistive devices, surgery for skeletal deformities, and safety of anesthesia have been designed with the contribution of neurologists, methodologists, orthopedists, physiatrists, anesthesiologists, and patients. These questionnaires have been tested on 21 patients and then formally finalized. The list of questionnaires has been completedwith existing validated scales: QUEST (Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technologies) on use of foot orthotics, FFI (Foot Function Index), ESS (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) for sleep, m-FIS (modified-Impact Fatigue Scale), HDAS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). We opened a website linked to the Registry where all the 10 questionnaires are now being filled online by CMT subjects adhering to the Registry and controls (recruited among friends and unaffected relatives of CMT participants, matched for age and sex; controls fill the questionnaires for pregnancy, anesthesia, and sleep). We aim at collecting information from 500 CMT subjects and at least 100 healthy controls. We will gain important information to give advice about pregnancy, orthotics, surgery, anesthesia, sleep and fatigue in CMT.

N2  - Background: Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), hallmarks of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), are described in about 30% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and, in a lesser extent, in other systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD). It is known the possible detrimental effect of aPL on pregnancy outcome since these conditions generally affect young women. A relationship between aPL and neurological manifestations has also been described in the frame of APS.On the contrary, the long-term neuropsychological outcome of children (chl) born to patients with aPL has been less investigated. Objectives: To evaluate the neurodevelopmental long-term outcome in chl exposed to maternal aPL during the third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: We enrolled 40 chl (median age 7.4 years, range 3-18; 19 female, 21 male) born to 32 women with SAD and aPL positivity during third trimester of pregnancy. In our cohort of 40 pregnancies, 21 mothers (53%) displayed triple aPL positivity,11 (30%) double, 8 (16%) single. 11 out of the 16 SLE pregnancies occurred in patients with anti ds-DNA antibodies, while anti-Ro/SSA were always negative.A neurological physical exam was performed by a pediatric neurologist in all children.The Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) and a home-made questionnaire focusing on maternal drugs during pregnancy, gestational age, baby developmental milestones, scholastic performances were submitted to all mothers. Intellectual functioning were assessed by Wechsler scale for corrected age. We also performed the NEPSY-II (Developmental NEuroPSYchological Assessment) when indicated. Results: All chl,when evaluated,displayed normal neurological physical exam and intelligence level.We found mild problems in 13 chl (32.5%). The maternal and delivery characteristics are showed in the table. 11 chl were found with discrepant cognitive profile (verbal intelligence quotient >or< performance intelligence quotient) and sleep disorders. These chl were also studied with NEPSY and 2 showed pathological results in one or more of the examined area; therefore both chl were diagnosed with learning disabilities and both were preterm, one from SLE-mother anti-dsDNA neg and single aPL pos, the other from APS-mother triple aPL pos). 4 chl (10%) had a history of seizures and 2 out of them belonged to the group with discrepant cognitive profile: 1 of them was preterm and had neonatal stroke. Conclusions: Minor neurological disorder can be found in chl exposed to aPL in utero. Notably, we have found 4 epileptic chl (10%); this frequency results about 20 times higher than that of normal population. It is difficult to say if these findings are due to prematurity, to maternal disease or to environmental factors because we could not find a significant relationship with any of the investigated variables. However our results underline the importance of a careful follow-up of chl born to patients with aPL in order to support the needs of a growing child. (Table Presented).

N2  - Growing evidence suggests than type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an independent risk factor for nocturnal hypoxemia and sleep breathing disorders. However, it is unknown whether these sleep disturbances affect daily somnolence and quality of sleep. We designed a case-control study between 290 patients with T2D and 290 non-diabetic subjects, matched by age, gender, BMI, and neck circumference; the 53.1% of them also had polysomnography (PSG) measurements. Exclusion criteria included respiratory, neuromuscular and cerebrovascular diseases, alcohol abuse, and pregnancy. The degree of sleepiness was evaluated using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In addition, 132 subjects (88 with T2D) were evaluated through: (i) the Berlin Questionnaire to measure the risk of having sleep apnea, (ii) the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to calculate sleep quality and disturbances, and (iii) the Quebec Sleep Questionnaire (QSQ) to assess health related quality of life in patients with sleep apnea. Daytime sleepiness was higher in T2D (7.3±4.3 vs. 5.9±4.1; p<0.001) and when HbA1c≥8.5% (7.5±4.5 vs. 6.2±4.1; p=0.0027) in comparison with control subjects and HbA1c<8.5%, respectively. As expected, a significant positive correlation between daytime sleepiness and PSG data was detected, but also with fasting glucose (r=0.124, p=0.005) and HbA1c (r=0.146, p=0.005). A stepwise regression analysis showed that the presence of T2D (but not gender, age, BMI, neck circumference, nor PSG measures) independently predicted the ESS score (R2=0.042). Finally, subjects with T2D showed (i) higher risk of having sleep apnea (p=0.047); (ii) lower health related quality of life (QSQ), mainly in domains related with night symptoms (p=0.042) and somnolence (p=0.028); and (iii) higher sleep disturbances (PSQI), primarily in the use of sleep medications. Therefore, T2D adversely affects sleep quality, becoming an independent risk factor for daytime sleepiness.

N2  - Postpartum depression (PPD) affects 7-15% of women in the general population, but women with bipolar and major depressive disorder are at an even greater risk. PPD confers major negative outcomes on mothers and their babies. For instance, children of mothers who suffered from PPD are at greater risk for development of affective, behavioural and cognitive problems. Moreover, several studies have found increased risk for infanticide and suicidal behaviour in this population, accounting for up to 20% of postpartum deaths. Therefore, it is imperative that proper risk factors for PPD are identified and the underlying biological mechanisms are better understood. In this study we investigated whether objective and subjective changes in circadian rhythms, as assessed with actigraphy and validated clinical questionnaires, from late pregnancy to early postpartum are associated with PPD. We investigated women with diagnosis of bipolar or major depression, as well as matched controls. All women were euthymic at the outset of the study. We found that both objective and subjective measures of circadian rhythms are associated with a significant increase in postpartum depressive symptoms only in women with bipolar and major depressive disorder, but not in healthy controls. This prospective study shows that specific identifiable measures of circadian rhythms are associated with increased risk for PPD and such risk is particularly high in women with mood disorders. Because all of these objective and subjective measures associated with risk are modifiable, treatment strategies targeting stabilization of the circadian system should be high priority in clinical management of this population.

N2  - We analyzed the association of sleep quality and glucose metabolism in women after gestational diabetes (pGDM) and in women after normoglycemic pregnancy (controls). Data during pregnancy and a visit within the first 15 months after delivery were collected from 61 pGDM and 30 controls in a prospective cohort study. This included a medical history, physical examination, questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), and 5-point oral glucose tolerance test with insulin measurements to determine indices of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. We used Spearman correlation coefficients and multivariate regression models for analysis.9.3±3.2 months after delivery, pGDM had significantly higher fasting and 2h glucose levels and lower insulin sensitivity than controls. There was no significant difference in age, BMI and sleep quality as assessed with the PSQI between the two groups. The PSQI score correlated with the ogtt-2h plasma glucose in pGDM (δ=0.41; p=0.0012), but not in controls. This association was confirmed with a multivariate linear regression model with adjustment for age, BMI and months post-delivery. Perceived stress was an independent risk factor (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.02-1.23) for impaired sleep. Our findings suggest that post-delivery sleep quality significantly influences glucose tolerance in women after GDM and that impaired sleep is associated with increased stress perception. Measures to improve of sleep quality and reduce perceived stress should therefore be tested as additional strategies to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes after GDM.

N2  - Study question: What are the attitudes and perceptions towards family formation among single and cohabiting women seeking individual fertility counselling? Summary answer: Well-educated women postpone pregnancy despite their knowledge of the decline in female fecundity with increasing age and their wish of motherhood. We observed an internal conflict of choosing parenthood, as the women described family formation as the meaning of life though they also had considerations related to the negative consequences. What is known already: During the past 30 years women and men have postponed family formation in Western societies. Several studies have shown that women tend to underestimate the decline in fecundity with age and overestimate the success rate in assisted reproductive technologies. A growing population of women decide to become solo-mothers through assisted reproduction using donor-sperm. Study design, size, duration: Baseline data from a longitudinal semi-structured qualitative interview study including 20 women aged 34-39 years seeking individual fertility counselling. A total of 25 women were contacted, two were excluded due to pregnancy. In all 10 single and 10 cohabiting women were included. Data was collected between March and September 2014. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Study participants were single or cohabiting women, residents in the Capital Region of Copenhagen, and seeking individual fertility counselling (Hvidman et al., 2015). Purposeful sampling with maximum variation was used. Data were analysed by qualitative content analysis following the methodology by Graneheim and Lundman. Main results and the role of chance: The study displayed the conflict towards parenthood both in the single and cohabiting women. The general attitudes and considerations towards family formation were characterised by the fear of negative consequences and lifestyle changes on one hand and the biological clock and the dream of the nuclear family on the other. Finding the right partner was a central point for all of the participants. Despite their advanced age none of the women felt ready to motherhood at the present. Both single and cohabiting women showed an increasing awareness of solo-motherhood as a possible solution to advanced age and the wish for a child. Limitations, reason for caution: The study participants had all chosen to seek individual fertility counselling. Hence, the results may not be directly transferred to a similar age group in the general population in regards to attitudes towards family formation and concerns of reproductive lifespan. Wider implications of the findings: Many women postpone childbearing to their late thirties and thereby risk infertility, smaller families than desired, and adverse obstetric outcomes. Our study contributes to the understanding of the personal considerations in relation to childbearing in women (mid- to late thirties). This may be useful in a fertility assessment and counselling setting providing individual guidance to women and men of reproductive age, and it may also be used to enhance pro-fertility initiatives in the general population.

We sought to describe the association between abnormal sleep duration and stroke in a cohort with diabetes. Data from the National Health Interview Survey (2004-2013) was examined. Only those answering “yes” to the question “Have you EVER been told by a doctor or other health professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?”; and females answering “yes” to the question “Other than during pregnancy, have you EVER been told by a doctor or other health professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?” were included in the analysis. Sleep duration was categorized as short (≤ 6 hours), normal (7-8 hours), or long (≥ 9 hours). Selfreported diagnosis of stroke was the main outcome of interest. A total number of 27, 223 self-reported diabetic patients (mean age (±SEM)= 36.9 (±0.03) years, and mean BMI (±SEM)=30.4 (±0.04) Kg/m2; 50.3% female; 6.6% Asians, 15.3% Blacks, and 76.1% Whites) provided valid data for the analysis. Stroke was reported in 8.7% of short sleepers, 15.9% of long sleepers and 7.9% of normative sleepers (p<0.05). Based on logistic regression analysis, adjusting for effects of age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity and medical comorbidities, diabetic patients with both short sleep and long sleep had an increased odds of stroke when compared to normal sleep duration (OR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.11 - 1.18, p<0.01; and OR=1.71, 95% CI: 1.47 - 1.99, p<0.01; respectively). In diabetic patients, abnormal sleep duration was associated with increased risk of stroke, and diabetic patients reporting long sleep duration had an almost twofold greater likelihood of having a stroke. Incorporating a sleep history into routine clinic visit examination may help healthcare providers optimize efforts to prevent or manage stroke in diabetic patients.

N2  - Sleep-disordered breathing occurs in 0.6-15% of reproductive age women. This condition is associated with an increased lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. A substantial body of evidence demonstrated increased perinatal morbidity among pregnancies affected by SDB including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia. These same conditions are predictive of later cardiovascular disease. Treatment of SDB has been demonstrated to decrease future cardiovascular events and mortality. Screening at-risk individuals in the perinatal period can identify women with SDB, who can benefit from treatment. Continuous positive airway pressure and lifestyle interventions can decrease subsequent adverse cardiovascular health outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder with both genetic as environmental etiology. Research that combines genetics, biology, environmental risk factors and early development of symptoms is still sparse. Material and Methods: 2,551 pregnant women giving birth in the municipality of Odense, Denmark in 2010-13 were recruited for a birth cohort. Data and biological material was collected during pregnancy, at birth and in the first three years of the infant. ADHD symptoms and other emotional and behavioral symptoms are rated by parents and teacher by use of CBCL 1-5 and C-TRF at about age 30month. Data on psychiatric heredity (registrar data), pregnancy and parent social status are combined with information about day-care setting, sleep and ADHD symptoms. Results: Parentally reported ADHD problems and sleep problems was highly correlated (ρ = 0.47; p<0.0001). Parent-reported parasomnia and night awakenings were significantly more frequent in an ADHD high score group vs. a low score group (p < 0.01).Also, actigraphy measures revealed that ADHD high score's had a more restless sleep compared to controls (p < 0.001), and atendency to more frequent night awakenings (p = 0.06). We found no differences in Total Sleep Time or Sleep Onset Latency. Number of month spent in day-care centre was significantly associated with lower levels of caregiver-reported total problem score and internalizing behaviour compared to tending in private day-care. These associations were not found in the parent-reports. Noassociations between age entering childcare and the outcome measures (CBCL/C-TRF problem scores) were found. Discussion: Sleep problems and day-care-setting among other factors, are possible hazards of pushing susceptible children, with parental disposition, towards fulfilling ADHD criteria. Perspective: These results are preliminary and part of a larger followup study, all aiming at development of a “Preschool ADHD Risk Index” which can be implemented in the primary sector to target ADHD-at-risk-children early in life.

N2  - Topiramate (TPM) is an increasingly used drug during childbearing ages for treatment of epilepsy, migraine, and appetite suppression as well as for off-label indications such as sleep and psychiatric disorders. Presently, while some reports suggested an increased risk of oral cleft (OC), these reports are balanced by studies that could not confirm such association. We conducted a meta-analysis of all studies reporting on women exposed to TPM during pregnancy. Of the 2327 publications reviewed, 6 articles met the inclusion criteria including 3420 patients and 1,204,981 controls. The odd ratio (OR) of OC after the first trimester exposure to TPM exposure was 6.26 (95% confidence interval: 3.13-12.51; P= 0.00001). This study provides strong evidence that TPM is associated with an increased risk of OC in infants exposed to TPM during embryogenesis and should lead to a careful review of TPM use in women of reproductive ages.

N2  - Psychosocial treatments (Psychoeducation, Social Rhythm Therapy, Family therapy and CBT) are effective in preventing bipolar relapse. Pregnancy is an ideal time to apply these interventions, either in combination with medication, or on their own to prevent relapse following childbirth. Psychosocial treatments can target factors that are known to trigger relapse among bipolar women. Triggering factors include sleep disruption, interpersonal difficulties and a failure to recognise early warning signs. The impact of these triggering factors can be reduced by the application of psychoeducation, learning how to recognise early warning signs, and developing strategies to deal with them when they arise; social rhythms therapy to develop a stable sleep wake cycle (as well as developing strategies to ensure a stable sleep wake cycle in immediate postpartum period) and CBT to deal with stresses that may arise during the pregnancy and stress inoculation for potential postpartum stresses. In this presentation these strategies will be outlined along with a series of cases demonstrating their application.

Is media coverage of advanced-age celebrity moms sending a wrong message to the women? The personal story of a woman who postponed her pregnancy till her late thirties for social reasons reveals the typical path of turning the social infertility into a medical condition. There are some things in life that just can't be postponed. Sharing patient's experience with delayed motherhood, the presentation is trying to find the reasons why so many women misread the signs of the biological clock.

N2  - Some studies have shown that there are gender differences in the risk to have some psychopathological symptoms during infancy, even, there are studies that have shown that some risk factors affects in different way to girls and boys along their development suggesting that boys have a special vulnerability to mental health problems during infancy. The main aim of this work is to determine which prenatal, perinatal and postnatal factors are related to infant psychopathological symptoms at 30 months taking into account if there are gender differences. The sample was composed by 89 fathermother- child triads who were followed during pregnancy and infant development at 30 months. The prenatal, perinatal and postnatal risk factors collected were: tobacco smoke during pregnancy (including second-hand smoking), infant tobacco exposure during their development, prenatal trait and state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-STAI), gestational age at birth, weight and length at birth, normal or difficult childbirth, parity, mother-father-child attachment at 6-12-30 months (Attachment subscale of the Parenting Stress Index- PSI), mother-father general health at 6-12-30 months (Total Score of the General Health Questionnaire-GHQ), infant breastfeeding and familiar socioeconomic status. The infant psychopathological symptoms were collected at 30 months by the Child Behavior CheckList (CBCL). After the study of the collinearity between variables a linear regression model was performed for each CBCL syndrome score (emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, somatic complaints, withdrawn, sleep problems, attention problems, aggressive behavior) and the results show that, in boys, lower attachment scores at 6 months were related to poorer scores in emotionally reactive, somatic complaints, withdrawn, and sleep problems. Moreover, the infant exposure to tobacco smoke and a shorter gestational age at birth (together with attachment score) were related to a poor withdrawn score too. In girls, mother's anxiety scores have shown relations with anxious/depressed and attention problems score. Our results show that there are gender differences in risk factors related to infant psychopathological symptoms having the attachment experiences an important in infant psychological development. Health professionals should pay more attention to these aspects promoting actions to assess the familial attachment, to detect alterations and to prevent mental health problems in the future.

N2  - Tracheomalacia is a failure of the normal cartilaginous support of the trachea. It recurs in almost 30% of children undergoing bronchoscopy for respiratory distress; it can be diagnosed incidentally in mild cases but nevertheless presents many symptoms such as prolonged expiration, cyanosis, brassy cough, apnea, feeding problems and recurrent pneumonia. It rarely necessitates any treatment. Chiari malformation is a congenital or acquired herniation of the cerebellum through the foramen magnum. Type1 (CM1) is the isolated protrusion of the cerebellar tonsils of 5mm or more. Although in many cases asymptomatic, it can incur headaches, ocular and lower cranial nerve signs, ataxia. Onset occurs usually in the third decade of life. Its prevalence is still unknown and inheritance recurs in 10-15% of cases. We describe the clinical case of a 20-month-old male subject born prematurely at 30 wks of gestation from twin births. Reanimation was necessary to treat early acute RDS with mechanical ventilation for several days and exogenous surfactant administration. The infant was finally discharged healthy after eight weeks from birth. Only a few months later, he began to present wheezing, recurrent vomiting, disturbed sleep and difficulties in breathing. Many hospitalizations where required until, at age of 11 months, during a severe RDS complicated by pneumonia and pneumothorax, the infant underwent bronchoscopy, of which the result was negative under curare. Another episode of acute severe RDS required critical care in a different UTIP after only a few months. In this occasion, bronchoscopy, repeated in spontaneous breathing, revealed severe tracheomalacia of the entire trachea. Tracheostomy restored respiratory function and spontaneous breathing. A brief healthy status followed until recurrence of vomiting, continuous perspiration, repeated central sleep apneas (27/hr at polysomnography). MNR revealed downward displacement below 16mm of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. This condition, in agreement with treatment of CM1, necessitated surgical enlargement of the foramen magnum as the only measure leading to the complete regression of all of the symptoms. Currently, at the age of 20 months, the patient is waiting for tracheostomy removal. The twin, until now healthy, has also presented a mild herniation of cerebellar tonsils at MNR of less than 3mm and is asymptomatic. The clinical case highlights some original aspects which need to be considered: A rare association between rare diseases, tracheomalacia and CM1, in a preterm newborn both leading to respiratory problems; the very early onset of CM1 before the second year of life despite common reports and the familiar recurrence in both twins. Last, tracheomalacia as model of illness, maybe complication of prematurity, and cause of acute life-threatening condition in which diagnosis is as apparently simple as is treatment, when necessitated. Spontaneous maturation of cartilaginous rings only allows normal respiration in spite of any treatment.

N2  - The objective of the study was to characterize the phenotype of males and females with autism spectrum disorder born preterm versus those born at term. Descriptive statistical analyses identified differences between male and female autism spectrum disorder subjects born preterm compared to term for several phenotypic characteristics and comorbidities. Of the 115 (13.0% of 883) born preterm, a greater percentage of males had sleep apnea (13.8% vs 2.5%, p < 0.0001), seizure disorders (17.0% vs 8.5%, p = 0.01), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (14.9% vs 6.6%, p = 0.005). Females born preterm were more likely to be nonverbal (22.2% vs 4.6%, p = 0.001). In summary, phenotypic differences were observed, especially among males. The results may have implications for understanding the underpinnings of a subset of individuals with autism spectrum disorder and contribute to the development of focused treatments for autism spectrum disorder among children born preterm.

N2  - Background and Aims: In Japan, local governments are performing pregnant infants health checkup as fundamental maternal-and-childhealth service. However, that cannot be diagnosing developmental diseases, such as ASD. Furthermore, it is increased that undiagnosed children fall into secondary obstacle because of maladjustment after entering school. So, we underwent five-year-olds health checkup in cooperation with a city, aimed to help early diagnosis and early intervention. We report the prevalence and comorbidity of ASD and ADHD in DSM-5 criteria, and the difference of clinical data between ASD, ADHD and healthy control in a community-based population sample of five-year-olds children. Methods: Subjects are 954/1310 children to become 5-year-old in April 2012 to March 2013. After primary screening (ASSQ, ADHD-RS, SDQ and DCDQ evaluated by parents) was performed, 226 secondly developmental health examination subjects were selected. Finally 159 children and their parents participated the examination. They completed questionnaires (AQ, Conners-3, PSI and CSHQ) evaluated by parents and we examined their intelligence and motor function by WISC-4 and M-ABC2 excepting severe developmental disorder. After examination, a pediatrician and psychiatrists diagnosed neuro developmental disorder using DSM-5 criteria. We calculated the prevalence and comorbidity of ASD and ADHD. Clinical data were statistically analyzed by multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correlation between ASD, ADHD and hearty control groups. Results: 29 children were diagnosed as ASD. The prevalence of ASD was 3.04 % (95 % confidence interval: 1.95-4.13) and the comorbidities of ASD were ADHD (41.4 %) and ID (41.4 %). 30 children were ADHD only. They didn't have any comorbidity. 20/29 ASDs had not been diagnosed with ASD until this health checkup. Furthermore, the utilization of support systems in ADHDs was only 3.4 %. Mean birth weight of ASDs was significantly lower than ADHD and control groups. Mean age of mother at birth of ADHDs was significantly younger than control group. In mean CSHQ scores, Night Wakings of ASDs was higher than ADHD group and Sleep Duration of ADHDs was significantly lower than control group. In mean Conners 3 scores, Anxiety of ASDs and ADHDs was significantly higher than control group respectively, Depression of ADHDs were significantly higher than control group. In mean PSI of child side scores, ASD group and ADHD group was significantly higher than control group respectively. Conclusion: These findings suggest that ASD and ADHD in 5-yearolds have more difficulties than healthy children and 40 % of them haven't yet received little support.

N2  - BACKGROUND: New parents have to adjust to less sleep, less free time, and more responsibility as a result of having a child. The purpose of this study was to examine how having a child impacts the physical activity (PA) beliefs and behaviors of new parents over a 2- to 3-year time period.
METHODS: Participants included 49 men and women (31% men, 96% white) who did not have a child at baseline (26.3 ± 1.1 years old) but did have a child at the time of follow-up (28.9 ± 1.7 years old). The child's mean age at follow-up was 12 ± 7 months old. PA was measured via questionnaire at baseline and again at follow-up. Interviews regarding PA occurred at follow-up.
RESULTS: PA significantly decreased in parents across the time period (P < .001), and parents attributed this decrease to having a child and being pregnant. Parents mentioned they lack time, energy, and motivation for PA as a result of caring for a new child. Parents who maintained their activity level stated they prioritized PA and chose activities they enjoyed.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that although activity levels decrease in individuals who have a child, PA in new parents may be a function of priority, intensity, and enjoyment.

N2  - Introduction: Expectant women experience progressively poorer nocturnal sleep as a result of normal physiological adaptations. Emerging evidence indicates that insufficient quantity and poor sleep quality are associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. One promising approach to counteract the negative effects of disturbed nocturnal sleep is to include daytime naps as part of a healthy sleep hygiene program. The objective of this study was to assess whether daytime naps negatively impact nocturnal sleep in early gestation. Methods: Daily sleep information was collected in three two-week periods, at Tl (10-12), T2 (14-16), and T3 (18-20 weeks gestation) with a daily sleep diary and an actigraph from 161 pregnant women in early gestation (10-20 weeks). The average number of naps, as well as the average length of each nap, were calculated from sleep diaries. Women 1were categorized first as Non-nappers (0 Naps/2-weeks); Moderate Nappers (1-3 Naps/2-weeks); or Frequent Nappers (≥ 4 Naps/2-weeks); then based on the average nap length as short (< 90 minutes) or long (≥ 90 minutes). Nocturnal sleep parameters included SOL, WASO, SE and TST SAS procedure MIXED was used for all analyses. Results: Women who took naps had a decrease in diary-assessed nocturnal TST, but not actigraphy-assessed TST. This observation was group and time specific. There were no other group differences. Women who napped ≥ 90 minutes had poorer diary-assessed SE and lower diary-assessed TST compared to those who took shorter naps. Length of nap was not associated with any other sleep measures. Conclusion: Daytime naps slightly impact nocturnal sleep duration, but do not impair sleep continuity or sleep quality among pregnant women. We propose that daytime naps provide a beneficial counter-measure to the sleep disruption commonly reported by pregnant women. This may be clinically beneficial given that sleep continuity and quality are important correlates of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Background: Sleep and biological rhythms disruptions have been associated with severity of depression in pregnancy. Recent evidence suggests that pregnant women with history of mood disorders have greater sleep/biological rhythms disruptions, even during remission. Our goal was to compare subjective and objective parameters of sleep and biological rhythms between euthymic pregnant women with history of mood disorders and healthy controls. Methods: Sixty-eight women in the third trimester of pregnancy completed the MINI Neuropsychiatric Interview, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN). Participants wore a wrist-worn actigraph for 3 or 21 days. MESOR, amplitude and acrophase were measured using Cosinor analysis. Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO), average sleep efficiency and total sleep time were obtained using the Actiware Version 6.0 software. Results: Compared to controls (N=42), women with history of mood disorders (N=26) had worse scores on subjective measures of sleep (PSQI; t=-2.53, p=0.01) and biological rhythms (BRIAN; t=-3.72, p0.05) or biological rhythms (MESOR, amplitude, acrophase, all p>0.05). Neither gestational week nor duration of actigraphy sampling affected this association. Conclusions: Euthymic women with a history of mood disorders displayed abnormal subjective but not objective sleep and biological rhythms in late pregnancy. This finding is in line with previous research showing discrepancy between subjective and objective measures in depression, and suggests that objective parameters of sleep and biological rhythms may be corrected with treatment.

N2  - Background: For pregnant women, previous history of mood disorders is a major risk factor for the development of postpartum depression. Given the relationship between circadian rhythms and mood disorders, we investigated the relationship between circadian rhythms in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and severity of depressive symptoms at 6-12 weeks postpartum. Methods: Thirty-two euthymic pregnant women (controls=19, mood disorder=13) were assessed during the 3rd trimester and at 6-12 weeks postpartum. Diagnoses were assessed using the MINI Neuropsychatric Interview. MESOR, amplitude and acrophase were assessed using wrist-worn actigraphs. Symptoms of depression, sleep quality, subjective biological rhythms, stress and anxiety were assessed using validated self-rated questionnaires. Results: For women with mood disorders postpartum depressive symptoms (PPDS) were correlated with third trimester anxiety (r=0.67), acrophase (r=0.65), stress (r=0.64) and biological rhythms (r=0.60). Multiple linear regression revealed a significant effect of stress, anxiety and acrophase (F=7.21, p=0.03) accounting for 73% of PPDS variance. In control women, PPDS were correlated with prenatal depression (r=0.67), stress (r=0.46), sleep quality (r=0.43) and biological rhythm (r=0.40). Multiple linear regression indicated that depression during pregnancy was the only significant predictor of PPDS (F=2.55, p=0.02). Conclusions: Our findings in a group of currently asymptomatic women suggest that third trimester phase-delay may represent a risk factor for the development of PPDS in high-risk women. Future studies should test and replicate the finding of acrophase as a potential novel biomarker of risk in this population.

N2  - Introduction: Poor sleep in pregnancy is a risk factor for numerous adverse neonatal outcomes including preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia. Maternal Cortisol has been proposed as a key biomarker linking poor sleep to adverse outcomes; however the association between sleep and Cortisol in pregnancy is not well understood. The goals of the current study were to examine 1) associations between maternal sleep and Cortisol in pregnancy, 2) maternal medical conditions and psychological well-being as potential intervening variables that may explain associations between sleep and Cortisol, and 3) associations among maternal sleep and neonatal outcomes. Methods: Participants were 217 pregnant women from a racially/ethnically diverse, low income sample. Participants completed three study sessions in second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at two time points over pregnancy and provided salivary Cortisol samples at wake-up, 30 minutes after wake-up, and bedtime for three days at 3 time points over pregnancy. Results: Fifty-three percent (53%) of women reported poor sleep quality in pregnancy. Poor sleep quality was associated with elevated evening Cortisol at 36 weeks but not at 24 or 30 weeks gestation. The association between sleep quality and evening Cortisol became nonsignificant after adjusting for psychological distress. We did not observe significant associations among sleep and neonatal outcomes. Conclusion: Poor sleep in pregnancy is associated with elevated evening Cortisol levels in late third trimester. Possible explanations for this association are discussed.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnant women experience a range of sleep disturbances from sleep maintenance issues to excessive daytime sleepiness. Emerging evidence suggests that there is also a lot of variability in sleep patterns and complaints, especially in early pregnancy. It is well accepted that sleep disturbance can dysregulate normal immune processes subsequently increasing risk for adverse health outcomes. While there is some evidence to support this in pregnancy, the data are limited. We examine whether substantial sleep disturbance (characterized by long sleep onset latencies, longer periods of wakefulness, low sleep efficiency and high sleep fragmentation (variability in these parameters)), during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy contributes to increased systemic inflammation. Methods: Sleep data were collected from daily sleep diaries (D) and actigraphy (A) for three 2-week periods (10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks) in 176 women without any self-reported sleep disorder or psy-chopathology. Morning plasma samples were collected at 12,16 and 20 weeks gestation and assayed for IL-6, TNF-a, and IFN-g. Univariate regression analysis was performed on all independent variables that showed moderate to strong correlation to the dependent cytokine value at a given time. Results: Cross-sectional associations confirm previous studies which suggest that components of poor sleep are associated with higher levels of cytokines. We observed: 1) the average (avg) dSOL (β = 0.014, p = 0.02) and avgaSOL (β = 0.018, p = 0.047), as well as the variability in aSOL (β = 0.016, p = 0.043) were associated with higher IL-6 at T1; 2) avgdWASO at T2 was associated with IL-6 (β = 0.012, p = 0.04) and avgaWASO at T3 was associated with TNF-a (β = 0.014, p = 0.043); 3) the avgdSE and IL-6 at Tl (β = -0.035, p = 0.02). Conclusion: This preliminary examination suggests (and corroborates) that specific aspects of disturbed sleep are associated with cytokine dysregulation in early pregnancy. This relationship is important given that cytokines are mediators of pathophysiology and that proper balance is necessary for fetal maintenance and success. Additional evaluation of these associations are necessary as persistent sleep disruption may increase risk of adverse maternal and infant outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep problems are a common health issue in women with pregnancy. Various factors such as depression, perceived stress, body weight, gestational age, contribute to the impaired sleep quality. Few studies are currently available regarding the determinants of sleep quality among pregnant women in China. The aim of the present study was to (a) calculate the prevalence of sleep disorder during pregnancy, (b) examine the difference in sleep quality among three trimesters, and (c) identify determinants of sleep quality of pregnant women. Methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey. 500 pregnant women were recruited at the outpatient department of obstetrics and gynecology of two teaching hospitals in central China. The face-to-face interview used to collect data, included information of sample characteristics, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), prenatal depression (the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS) and perceived social support (Multidimensional scale of perceived social support, MSPSS). Results: A total of 454 pregnant women participated in the study between December 2013 and July 2014.87% pregnant women experience sleep disorder (PSQI score > 5). Poorer global sleep quality, subjective sleep quality, lower sleep efficiency and sleep disturbances were most prevalent during third trimester. The significant contributors of sleep quality for pregnant women were prenatal depression, age and gestational age. Conclusion: Sleep disorder is very common in pregnant women from China. Depressive symptoms, increased age and gestational age are determinants of sleep quality. Health care professionals should identify determinants to conduct preventive intervention.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbance is among the most prevalent symptoms during pregnancy. Sleep alterations during pregnancy are in part attributable to significant physical and hormonal changes as well as possibly to new roles and demands in the family and society, but to our knowledge the extent to which sleep hygiene practices contribute to poor sleep in pregnant women has not been described. The purposes of the study were to compare sleep hygiene and actigraphic sleep in pregnant women with and without self-reported poor sleep quality and to identify predictive factors associated with self-reported sleep quality in pregnant women. Methods: A total of 197 third-trimester pregnant women completed the Sleep Hygiene Practice Scale (SHPS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) as well as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and wore an actigraph for seven continuous days. Student t-test was used to compare the SHPS scores and mean as well as variability of actigraphy sleep variables between poor sleepers (i.e., PSQI global score > 5) and good sleepers (i.e., PSQI global score ≤ 5). Results: Poor sleepers reported significantly poorer sleep hygiene (p < 0.05), with higher SHPS score and higher subscale scores (sleep schedule, arousal-related behavior, sleep environment). Poor sleepers had significantly greater day-to-day variability of sleep onset latency (p < 0.05), total nighttime sleep (p < 0.05), wake after sleep onset (p < 0.05), and fragmentation index (p < 0.01) than good sleepers. Stepwise linear regression analyses showed that working hours per week (p = 0.02), CES-D total scores (p < 0.01), and SHPS arousal-related behavior subscale scores (p < 0.01) emerged as significant predictors of PSQI global sleep quality scores. Conclusion: Findings of this study support evaluating women's sleep hygiene practices and mood status during routine prenatal care as one way to improve sleep health during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Sleepiness during nighttime shift-work in nurses affects the safety of nurses and their patients. Evidence suggests that napping may be an effective countermeasure for the negative consequences of nighttime shift-work on nurses' functioning, yet few field studies have been done. We examined the effectiveness of a scheduled nap during the nadir of alertness, for reducing sleepiness and maintaining vigor in nurses during night shifts. Methods: In an experimental field study, 122 female nurses (mean age 39.04 ± 9.1) working 8-hr rotating shifts were recruited by cluster sampling from two hospitals in Israel. All had an appointment of ≥ 75% and worked ≥ 1 night shift per week, were not pregnant, and had no diagnosed sleep or chronic medical condition. The protocol was conducted during nurses' usual work schedule and included two nights with and two nights without a scheduled nap, in randomized orders. During nap nights, nurses napped in a dark quiet bedroom between 04:00-04:40. On non-nap nights they worked as usual. Sleepiness was evaluated hourly (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS) and vigor was assessed at 03:00, 05:00 and 07:00 (6-item scale). Mixed models tested nap condition, time, and nap condition∗time interactions, adjusting for age and workload. Results: Nurses slept 29.55 (± 11.73) and 30.47 (± 13.03) minutes with 79% (± 19) and 76% (± 21) sleep efficiencies on nap nights one and two respectively. On nap nights, levels of sleepiness were lower at 05:00, 06:00 and 07:00 and vigor was higher at 05:00 and 07:00 (all p < 0.001), compared to non-nap nights. In the adjusted models, main effects for sleepiness and vigor were found for nap condition [F = 41.25, F = 60.87], time [F = 119.73, F = 17.82] and nap condition∗time interaction [F = 12.07, F = 14.06], respectively (all p < 0.001). Conclusion: Based on self-report, a planned nap reduces sleepiness and maintains vigor during the last hours of the night-shift, and may provide an effective, low-cost and simple strategy to improve occupational functioning of the nursing staff.

N2  - Introduction: Poor sleep promotes inflammation. In turn, inflammation is a causal mechanism in term as well as preterm parturition. In the US, a persistent racial disparity in preterm birth exists, with African Americans showing ∼1.5× greater risk. This study examined associations among sleep quality, serum proinflammatory cytokines, and length of gestation in a racially diverse sample of 138 pregnant women. Methods: Women completed the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and other psychosocial and behavioral measures during mid-pregnancy. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were determined by high sensitivity assays. Birth outcomes were determined via medical record review. Results: Among African American women (n = 79), shorter gestation was predicted by poorer overall sleep (rs = -0.35, p = 0.002) as well the following PSQI subscales: subjective sleep quality (rs = -0.34, p = 0.002), sleep latency (rs = -0.27, p = 0.02), and sleep efficiency (rs = -0.27, p = 0.02). African American women with poor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) had 3.12 times the odds of preterm birth compared to those with good sleep quality. In contrast, among European American women (n = 53), gestational length was not significantly predicted by sleep quality (ps > 0.12). Bootstrapping analyses showed that IL-8 significantly mediating the relationship between sleep quality and length of gestation among African Americans, (indirect effect estimate -0.029; 95% CI -0.06, -0.002). Conclusion: These data provide novel evidence that, as compared to European American women, African Americans exhibit greater inflammation in response to sleep disturbance and these effects correspond with length of gestation. Racial differences in susceptibility to sleep-induced immune dysregulation may contribute to marked racial disparities in preterm birth.

N2  - Introduction: We sought to evaluate the construct validity and factor structure of the Spanish-language version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) among pregnant Peruvian women. Methods: A cohort of 642 women was interviewed at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation. During interview, we ascertained information about lifestyles, demographics, sleep characteristics, and mood symptoms. Stress induced sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) assessment scales respectively. Consistency indices, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, correlations, and logistic regressions were used. Results: Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated a three-factor solution: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and sleep medication. We observed significantly positive correlations of the PSQI with the FIRST (0.42), the PHQ-9 (0.49), and the GAD-7 (0.46). Poor sleepers (PSQI global score > 5) had significantly increased odds of experiencing stress induced sleep disturbance (odds ratio, OR = 3.64; 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.48, 5.35), depression (OR = 5.72; 95% CI: 3.79, 8.65), and probable generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 4.51; 95% CI: 3.09, 6.60). Conclusion: The Spanish-language version of the PSQI instrument was found to have good construct validity among pregnant Peruvian women. Consistent with some other studies, the PSQI was found to have a three-factor structure. Further assessment and validation studies are needed to determine whether the three factor-specific scoring of the PSQI is favored over the PSQI global score in diverse populations.

N2  - Introduction: New mothers often complain of impaired neuropsychological functioning, though the mechanism behind such complaints is unclear. Sleep fragmentation, often experienced in the transition from pregnancy to postpartum, has a negative relationship with neuropsychological functioning, though this relationship has rarely been studied in this population. This study had three hypotheses: 1) perinatal women would experience increased sleep fragmentation from late pregnancy to early postpartum 2) perinatal women would perform worse on measures of neuropsychological functioning compared to a control group; 3) increased sleep fragmentation from pregnancy to postpartum would predict poorer neuropsychological performance. Methods: Participants were 52 (20 pregnant, 32 non-pregnant) young adult women. Women wore an actiwatch for four to seven nights and completed neuropsychological testing at baseline (last month of pregnancy in perinatal group) and again approximately six weeks later (fourth postpartum week in perinatal group). Actigraphy measured wake after sleep onset (WASO) and fragmentation index (FI). Three tests from the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric (ANAM) were selected to measure processing speed, working memory, and executive functioning. Results: 1) MANOVA results revealed a significant group∗time interaction for sleep, indicating pregnant women experienced a significant increase in fragmentation from the first time point to the second compared to controls. 2) Perinatal women had significantly worse neuropsychological performance on all tasks during both time periods, but there was no group∗time interaction. 3) Regression analyses showed increased fragmentation from the first time point to the second predicted worse performance on the executive functioning task but not the processing speed or working memory tasks. Conclusion: Perinatal women experienced more sleep fragmentation and neuropsychological impairment from pregnancy to postpartum compared to a control group. An increase in sleep fragmentation from pregnancy to postpartum was predictive of executive functioning performance but did not impact processing speed or working memory. However, results might be limited due to small sample size.

N2  - Introduction: Poor sleep is common during pregnancy but little is known about insomnia disorder (ID) during pregnancy. Even less is known about how insomnia that develops during pregnancy compares with preexisting insomnia among pregnant women. Methods: Data were collected from pregnant women (gestational ages 18-32 weeks) undergoing screening for an ongoing treatment study of cognitive behavioral therapy for perinatal insomnia. Women who met DSM-5 criteria for ID with no coexisting affective or sleep disorders were recruited from local obstetric clinics and the surrounding community. All participants completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Trained interviewers assessed ID onset relative to pregnancy. Results: At present, 39 women (age 31.6 ± 4.2 years) with mean gestational age 26 weeks (SD = 5.2 weeks) have enrolled in this study. Thirty-one percent of participants reported at least one episode of insomnia prior to their current pregnancy (preexisting ID). Seventy-two percent were experiencing their first episode of insomnia, with onset during the current pregnancy (pregnancy-onset ID). Women who endorsed ID onset during their current pregnancy had significantly lower scores on the ISI [t(36) = 2.84, p = 0.007] and EPDS [t(35) = 2.21, p = 0.043], but did not differ statistically in regards to pregnancy week, age, or working status. An ANCOVA assessing differences in insomnia between groups while controlling for depression found no significant difference in the adjusted insomnia severity between the groups [F(l, 34) = 2.20, p = 0.15, partial eta squared = 0.06]; with depression being significant covariate in this model [F(1,34) = 9.40, p = 0.004, partial eta squared = 0.22]. Conclusion: Pregnant women with ID onset during the current pregnancy reported less severe insomnia than those with preexisting ID; however, this difference was no longer significant when controlling for depression symptoms. These results suggest insomnia that develops during pregnancy is a significant sleep disorder that merits clinical attention.

N2  - Background: Postpartum depression negatively impacts on the maternal health and behavior, child outcomes, maternal-infant interactions and the father's mental health. It has been shown that postpartum depression was associated with sleep disturbance, lack of social support and marital problem, prenatal depression and lumbopelvic pain (LPP) during pregnancy. LPP is one of the common symptoms during pregnancy, and the intensity would increase during the course of pregnancy. Some studies suggested that pregnancyrelated LPP would result from psychological determinants such as stress and fear-avoidance beliefs. Fear-avoidance model was established in patients with chronic lowback pain, and fear of movement (kinesiophobia), one of the components of the model, was associated with depression in the subjects. However, no study has investigated whether kinesiophobia during pregnancy would have some influence on depression after delivery. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of kinesiophobia at late pregnancy on depression at 1 month after delivery among pregnant women with pregnancy-related LPP. Methods: The study participants were 43 pregnantwomen who experienced pregnancy-related LPP in late pregnancy and completed self-reported questionnaires at late pregnancy and 1month after delivery. Questionnaire was structured by demographic data, presence of LPP, pain intensity, the number of pain location, kinesiophobia and depression. We evaluated pain intensity using Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The Japanese version of the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) was used to evaluate kinesiophobia, and depression was assessed by the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). In this study, we divided participants into two groups by using SDS score. The score with more than 40 was defined as depression. In univariate analysis, TSK scores at late pregnancy were compared between groups using independent t-test (depression or no depression). Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify TSK score at late pregnancy as independent predictor of depression at 1 month after delivery, with adjusted for confounding factors. The statistical significance level was set at p < .05. Results: TSK scores at late pregnancy were significantly higher in depression group than no-depression group in univariate analysis (p = .03). TSK scores at late pregnancy were independently associated with depression at 1 month after delivery even after adjusted for confounding factors (OR = 1.99, 95%CI 1.22-4.81). However, VAS and the number of pain location at late pregnancy were not significantly associated (p = .08, p = .14). Conclusion(s): Kinesiophobia at late pregnancy negatively influenced on depression at 1 month after delivery among pregnant women with pregnancy-related LPP. Future research is needed to investigate the factors associated with exacerbation of fear of movement in detail in order to prevent postpartum depression. Implications: This study suggested that approach to kinesiophobia might reduce risk of onset of postpartum depression among pregnant women with pregnancy-related LPP.

N2  - Introduction: Hypomanic symptoms in the early postpartum period are linked to a risk of postpartum depression (PPD). Although women experience profound sleep changes during the perinatal period and decreased sleep may precipitate mania/hypomania, links between hypomanic symptoms and sleep/circadian rhythms have not been studied at this life transition. Methods: We studied 30 women (mean age 28.3 ± 5.3 years) with a history of major depression from 3rd trimester to 16 weeks postpartum. Potential participants who met criteria for a mood episode at enrollment (33 weeks gestation) were excluded. Participants rated hypomania symptoms on the Highs Scale (Glover et al., Br J Psych, 1994); depressive symptoms were measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) at 2, 6, and 16 weeks postpartum. Sleep onset, sleep offset, and total sleep time (TST) were estimated with wrist actigraphy averaged over one week at 33 weeks gestation and postpartum weeks 2, 6, and 16. Salivary dim light melatonin (DLMO) was measured at 3rd trimester and 6 weeks postpartum. Results: At postpartum week 2, average Highs score was 1.8 ± 2.0 (range = 0-8). The most common symptoms were racing thoughts (endorsed by 44.3%) and feeling more active than usual (endorsed by 30%). Two groups based on Highs Score at postpartum week 2 included a Euthymic Group (EG; n = 15) with Highs Scores < 2 (mean = 0.3 ± 0.5) and Hypomanic Symptom Group (HG; n = 15) with Highs Scores ≥ 2 (mean= 3.3 ± 1.6). At 3rd trimester and 2 weeks postpartum, HG women had later estimated sleep onset (Week 33: HG = 00:16 ± 66 min vs. EG = 22:47 ± 50 min, t = -4.15, df = 28, p < 0.001; Week 2: HG = 00:06 ± 80 min vs. EG = 23:11 ± 60 min, t = -2.12, df = 28, p = 0.04) and sleep offset times (Week 33: HG = 8:31 ± 85 min vs. EG = 7:22 ±72 min, t=-2.41, df=28, p = 0.02; Week2:HG= 8:55 ±101 min vs. EG = 7:47 ± 63 min, t = -2.18, df = 28, p = 0.04) than EG women. DLMO tended to be later in HG (21:54 ± 95 min) compared to EG (20:53 ± 88 min; t = -1.73, df = 24, p = 0.09) at 33 weeks. There were no differences in sleep timing at 6 or 16 weeks postpartum; TST did not differ between groups at any time point. HAM-D-17 scores were higher in HG vs. EG at all postpartum weeks, even with sleep items excluded. Conclusion: Self-reported hypomanic symptoms during the early postpartum are associated with later bedtimes and rise times at 3rd trimester of pregnancy and 2 weeks postpartum. Women with mixed depressive/hypomanic symptoms are more likely to experience PPD. Later sleep timing may be a modifiable risk factor for development of PPD.

N2  - Introduction: Anecdotal evidence suggests that sleep symptoms change as pregnancy progresses such that fatigue is prevalent early on in pregnancy while insomnia symptoms are more prevalent during later pregnancy. Our aim was to examine self-reported sleep disorder symptoms across the pregnancy period. We hypothesized that women would report sleep disordered symptoms regardless of their trimester. Methods: Participants were pregnant females attending a prenatal visit from October 2013 to October 2014 who completed a brief survey in-office asking about sleep disorder symptoms and sleep parameters. 148 (mean age = 26.8 ± 4.5 yrs) provided complete data on age, gestation week, and sleep. 39% were first time mothers-to-be. Women were compared on their sleep disorder breathing symptoms (STOP), daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]), insomnia symptoms (Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale [WHIIRS]), and mood symptoms (mood). Women's sleep parameters the previous night, taken from the 24-Hr Sleep Pattern Inventory, were time in bed (TIB; duration from bedtime to waketime), night wakings (NWAK; number of wakings), and sleep quality (SQ; rating of 1 = very poor to 5 = slept like a baby). ANCOVAs examined differences between women in their 2nd and 3rd trimesters for sleep disordered symptoms and sleep parameters with age and 1st pregnancy status as covariates. Results: Overall, 45%) reported sleeping longer and 55% reported sleeping better prior to pregnancy. No significant difference was found between 2nd and 3rd trimesters for reported symptoms on the STOP (1.3 vs 1.1, p = 0.12, respectively), ESS (7.9 vs 8.3, p = 0.582), WHIIRS (11.7 vs 12.9, p = 0.252), and mood (3.9 vs 3.7, p = 0.656). Two trends were found: (a) 1st time mothers-to-be reported greater daytime sleepiness (p = 0.089) and older women reported more insomnia symptoms (p = 0.080). In addition, no significant difference was found between groups for TIB (8.5 vs 9, p = 0.113), NWAK (2.6 vs 3.1, p = 0.210), and SQ (2.9 vs 2.9, p = 0.767). Conclusion: These data indicate that sleep is problematic throughout the pregnancy period. The high WHIIRS scores for both groups suggest that pregnancy may be a contributing factor to women being at greater risk of insomnia. While sleep disorders adversely affect health in the general population, very little is known about how these disorders impact maternal and infant postnatal outcomes. We hope to explore this more fully.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy may be associated with preeclampsia (PEC), cesarean delivery (CD) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We implemented the STOPBANG Questionnaire (SB), a common screening tool for OSA, in a subspecialty obstetrics clinic established to mitigate gestational weight gain in low-income, urban obese gravidas. Subjects met biweekly with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, a nutritionist and a social worker to enact lifestyle changes for enhanced health. Objective: To evaluate the association between the SB findings and adverse maternal outcomes among an obese, pregnant cohort. Methods: Of the 297 women prospectively enrolled in the cohort, 157 had both delivery and SB data and thus were included in the current analysis. BMI was measured at the time of SB screening. The associations between SB findings and adverse maternal outcomes were analyzed using multiple logistic regression to control for potential confounders, including age, parity, hypertension, and BMI. Results: BMI ranged from 30 to 71 kg/m∧2 (M=41, SD=7.5), age from 15 to 42 years (M=26.7, SD=5.6) and 93% were African American. 46% of women screened positive for OSA using SB. A + SB screen was associated with an increased risk of GDM (OR=2.71, CI=1.02-7.21) but was not associated with CD or PEC in this cohort. Conclusions: Among obese gravidas, a + SB screen was a significant predictor of GDM, suggesting an independent association between sleep-disordered breathing and glucose metabolism. This association suggests that early glucose screening is indicated in the obese gravida with a + OSA screen. Further study is needed to determine if preconception OSA evaluation and treatment, in addition to standard weight loss management, can mitigate GDM and its consequences. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Introduction: Prevalence of obesity is increasing in women of reproductive age, heightening the risk for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in this young population. Pregnancy physiology adds to this risk, making pregnant women more susceptible to SDB. Though SDB has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, it is not clear whether symptoms predating pregnancy are associated with a different set of outcomes compared to symptoms occurring de novo in pregnancy. Methods: English-speaking women within 48 hours postpartum were recruited and screened for the frequency of snoring in the last three months of pregnancy, using a question from the multivariable apnea prediction index. Women rated their snoring as never, occasionally, sometimes, frequently or always. Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and BMI at delivery were collected. Pregnancy outcomes collected included preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, neonatal birth weight, gestational age at birth, and Apgar scores. Results: Participants were 539 pregnant women enrolled in a study assessing outcomes of SDB in pregnancy. 114 women (21%) reported snoring only in pregnancy, and 77 women (14%) reported snoring both prior to and during pregnancy. T-tests were used to examine whether snoring groups differed on maternal characteristics, pregnancy, or infant outcomes. Results revealed that groups significantly differed on pre-pregnancy (t = -4.07, p < 0.001) and pregnancy BMI (t = -5.41, p < 0.001), such that persistent snorers had higher BMI both prior to and during pregnancy than women who snored only during pregnancy. There was a higher prevalence of chronic hypertension (p = 0.009), gestational diabetes (p = 0.01) and Cesarean deliveries (p = 0.01) in persistent snorers compared to de novo snorers. There were no significant differences in gestational hypertensive disorders or neonatal outcomes between the two groups. Conclusion: Women with pre-pregnancy snoring were more obese, had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, and higher rates of Cesarean deliveries compared to those who started snoring in pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Specific Aims: To identify patients whose children have born and sent to the NICU at UC Davis Medical Center who are at risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by utilizing the STOP-BANG questionnaire. (STOP-BANG stands for Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apnea, high blood Pressure, BMI, Age, Neck circumference, Gender). We also evaluate the mothers in the newborn nursery with the STOP-BANG questionnaire as our control group. This is a prospective study. Hypothesis: A large population of mothers who delivered neonates that were admitted to the NICU will have a higher risk of sleep apnea based on the STOP-BANG questionnaire. Methods: A prospective study evaluating mothers in the NICU and newborn nursery with the STOP-BANG questionnaire to evaluate for the risk of OSA. Results: The base study prior to this was at UCSF Fresno that showed 70%) of the patients that were admitted to the hospital pregnant and hypertensive surveyed had either snoring and/or witnessed apneas. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was between 1-22. More specifically, 10% of the patients had a ESS of 1-5, 40% were between 6-10, 40% were between 11-15, and 10%) had a score of more than 15. Furthermore, there did not seem to be a correlation with how the blood pressure was and symptoms of OSA. Conclusion: Mothers who have complications in the pregnancy such as hypertension have a higher pretest probability of having OSA.

N2  - Introduction: We examined the experiences of narcoleptic women on issues related to pregnancy and contraception and their perception of adequacy of provider counseling and education. Methods: Narcoleptic women were invited to complete a questionnaire posted on the Narcolepsy Network website in 2012 addressing knowledge and experiences related to relationships between narcolepsy pharmacotherapy and contraception and pregnancy. Results: 182 women (age 41.6, range 17-87) participated. 67.6% reported 318 pregnancies resulting in 217 live births. 12.1% reported unplanned pregnancies. 22.0%) of women with pregnancies took narcolepsy medications during 36 pregnancies resulting in 21 live births, 12 miscarriages, and 3 elective terminations. Medications used included modafmil (16.7%), traditional stimulants (72.2%), sodium oxybate (5.6%), and antidepressants (55.6%). Respondents took 1 medication in 58.3%, 2 medications in 33.3%, and 3 medications in 8.3% pregnancies. Complications included pre-term labor (n = 5), preeclampsia (n = 3), and cataplexy during labor (n = 1). Among 21 live births exposed to narcolepsy medications in utero, 90.5% were reported as normal, 4.8% had developmental delay, and 4.8% had a birth defect (ear deformity). 34.2% of women with pregnancies reported discontinuing medications for reasons which included fear of fetal adverse effects (92.9%), advice of narcolepsy provider (54.8%), and advice of other provider (38.1%). Management after discontinuing medications included sleep extension (83.3%), increased caffeine (40.5%), medical leave (31.0%), and driving abstinence (26.2%). Counseling from narcolepsy providers was recalled by 29.1% respondents regarding medication use, 21.4% regarding contraception, and 24.2% regarding interaction of hormonal contraception and medications. Only 21.4% respondents reported receiving adequate counseling. Conclusion: Most women with narcolepsy perceive inadequate education/counseling relative to contraception and pregnancy, potentially increasing unplanned pregnancy and abnormal pregnancy outcomes. Albeit with limitations of recall bias and self-report, this research highlights the need to optimize narcolepsy education in pregnancy planning and provide relevant information to guide patient-provider decision-making.

N2  - This study investigated the mediating roles of sleep and depression on the relationships between stress, fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake among low-income overweight and obese pregnant women by trimesters. Participants (N = 213) completed a self-administered survey including stress (exogenous variable), depression, sleep (mediators), fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake (endogenous variables). Path analysis was performed to compare mediation effects among pregnant women in each trimester. Consistently across three trimesters, stress was related to depression but not sleep duration, night time sleep disturbance, sleep quality, sleep latency or fat intake. Sleep duration was not associated with depression. Depending on trimester, night time sleep disturbance, sleep quality, and sleep latency were related to depression; night time sleep disturbance and depression affected fat intake; stress influenced fruit and vegetable intake. Sleep duration, sleep disturbance, sleep quality, sleep latency and depression did not mediate the relationships between stress, fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake in the second and third trimesters. However, depression mediated the relationship between stress and fat intake in the first trimester. Stress management interventions may help low-income overweight and obese pregnant women decrease depressive symptoms and therefore contribute to overall nutritional health.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is common among pregnant women. No study has thus far investigated the effect of maternal SDB on the infant's neurodevelopment. Our objective was to examine the effect of maternal SDB on sleep and neurodevelopment at the age of one year. Methods: Healthy pregnant women with uncomplicated, full-term pregnancies underwent ambulatory sleep evaluation (Watch-PAT; Ita-mar Medical) and categorized into SDB (i.e.:AHI > 5) and controls. At 12 months of age the Infant Development Inventory (IDI) and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) were administered. Results: Fifty-one full-term infants were studied (58% males). The mean birthweight percentile was 63.0 ± 23.6. The mean Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were 8.7 ± 1.2 and 9.8 ± 0.5 respectively. Eleven women had SDB (i.e; AHI > 5). No significant differences were found in the gross and fine motor, language and self-help developmental scores between the two groups. The mean social developmental scores were lower in the study group when compared to the controls and almost reached statistical significance (97.8 ± 19.7 vs. 114.9 ± 28.3, p = 0.067). A social developmental score below 100 was detected in 7 (64%) infants born to SDB mothers compared to 10 (26%) controls (adjusted p = 0.036, OR 16.7). No significant differences in nocturnal sleep duration, daytime sleep, number of nocturnal awakenings, sleep latency, and frequency of problematic sleep were found between children born to mothers with SDB compared with controls. However, infant snoring was reported by 5/12 (41.7%) of mothers with SDB compared to 3/40 (7.5%) of controls (p = 0.004). Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest that maternal SDB has no large adverse effect on neuromotor development but may affect social development at the age of one year. In addition, maternal SDB is associated with increased rate of infant's snoring.

N2  - Introduction: Children sleep has been associated with subsequent health outcomes, but less is known about sleep trajectories and their associated factors among preschoolers. Methods: We included 1258 children from the French mother-child EDEN cohort with sleep data between 2 and 5.5 years old. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify night sleep duration (NSD) trajectories and simultaneously identify time-stable factors explaining differences between trajectories and time-dependent factors associated with variations within trajectories. Studied time-stable factors concerned the family (income, educational level, familial status), the mother (age at birth, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, depression, smoking status) and the child (term, gender, birth-weight, breastfeeding duration); Time-dependent factors were childcare arrangement, working mother, parental presence when falling asleep, BMI-z-score, night awakenings, nap, physical activity and TV viewing durations. Results: Five distinct NSD trajectories were identified: constant-short sleepers (CSS, < 10h30/night, 5.5%), constant-medium-low sleepers (CMLS, < 11h/night, 45.0%), constant-medium-high sleepers (CMHS, ≈llh30/night, 36.5%), decreasing-long sleepers (DLS, ≥ llh30/night, 5.1%)) and modifier sleepers (MS, i.e. LS-MLS, 1.9%). Factors associated with increased risk for SS trajectory were being a first-born child and having a smoking mother during and after pregnancy. Within SS group, NSD between 2 and 5.5 years was negatively associated with TV viewing duration. Factors associated with increased risk for LS trajectory were being a girl, born to a young or a mother who smoked during pregnancy. Within LS group, NSD was negatively associated with collective childcare arrangement, parental presence when falling asleep and TV viewing duration. Factor associated with increased risk for MS trajectory was having a smoking mother during pregnancy. In MS group, NSD was negatively associated with collective childcare arrangement. Conclusion: Early life factors, especially maternal smoking during pregnancy, were associated with several sleep trajectories from 2 to 5.5 years. Factors associated with sleep duration changes within trajectory groups were mainly behavioral.

N2  - Introduction: Studies have demonstrated that sleep restriction adversely affects appetite regulating hormones, insulin sensitivity, inflammation and autonomic function. However, data regarding the clinical consequences of short sleep durations during pregnancy are limited. Our objective was to determine whether insufficient sleep is associated with increased risks of gestational hypertension (GHTN), preeclampsia (PE), and/or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: Women enrolled in a mutli-center prospective cohort study of adverse pregnancy outcomes in nulliparous women with singleton gestation were recruited at the 2nd study visit (16 0/7-21 6/7 weeks) to wear an actigraph (Spectrum, Philips Respironics) to record objective sleep activity for 7 consecutive days. Women with pregestational diabetes and chronic hypertension were excluded. Short sleep duration (SSD) was defined as average sleep of < 7 hours per night. Results: Actigraphy and outcome data were obtained for 760 women. Median sleep duration was 7.4 (IQR 1.) hours, and 28% of women had SSD, averaged over the 7 days. 5.1% of women developed GHTN, 5.1%) developed PE and 4.1% developed GDM. For those with SSD (n = 212) 6.6% had GDM, 11.3% had GHTN/PE and for those with No SSD (n = 548), 3.1% had GDM, 9.9% had GHTN/PE. SSD was associated with an increased rate of GDM even after adjusting for age and BMI (aOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.02-4.41), but was not associated with GHTN and/or PE. Conclusion: SSD during pregnancy, a potentially modifiable factor, is associated with the development of GDM after controlling for maternal age and BMI. Further research can establish if screening for sleep disturbances and education to modify sleep patterns in women with SSD can lessen the risk of GDM.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep quantity and quality were associated in school-aged children to cognitive development measured by the executive functioning, school performance, intelligence quotient (IQ), language development, and memory learning. Few studies were conducted among preschoolers from healthy general population and usually focused on only one aspect. We aimed at identifying, among 3 years old children, factors associated with IQ estimated through WPPSI-III and its indicators i.e. full-scale (FSIQ), verbal (VIQ) and performance (PIQ) scores. Methods: We included children from the French birth-cohort AuBE with a WPSSI-III test performed at 3 years old (N = 188) and available sleep data. Information on mothers and children were collected through self-questionnaires at birth, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. We considered mother's age at birth, working category, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy, gender, term at birth, birth weight, breastfeeding duration, childcare arrangement and child's TV viewing duration. Child's sleep duration (night and naps), snoring (> 3 times/week) and night-awakenings were also collected at each age. A day/total sleep duration ratio was calculated. Analyses were performed using linear regressions. Results: Mean scores were 106 (range: 62-138), 92 (61-140) and 99 (61-138) for VIQ, PIQ and FSIQ, respectively. Being a > 3 born-child from an unemployed overweight mother and watching TV > 1 hours/day at 24 months were negatively associated with QIV while night-awakenings at 6 months were positively associated; Snoring at 18 months, watching TV > 2 hours/day at 24 months, and having a manual worker mother was negatively associated with PIQ while day/total sleep ratio at 12 months and collective childcare arrangement at 24 months were positively associated. All factors but working category were significantly associated with FSIQ. Conclusion: Factors associated with FSIQ reflected those associated with VIQ and PIQ subscales. Different sleep characteristics at 6,12 and 18 months influenced IQs scores at 3 years old.

N2  - Introduction: Depression is common in postpartum women, and the relationship between altered perinatal sleep and mood is increasingly being elucidated. However, the magnitude and chronicity of sleep changes that affect postnatal mood has received scant attention. Methods: Women (n = 316 Maori, mean age 28.9 years; n = 635 non-Ma¯ori, mean age 32.2 years) completed comprehensive sleep, physical and mental health questionnaires during the third trimester of pregnancy (T2), and at 3-8 weeks (T3) and 11-13 weeks postnatal (T4). Pre-pregnancy sleep variables (Tl) were reported retrospectively at T2. Symptoms of postnatal depression (PND) were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Adjusting for demographics factors (maternal age, ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation) and key risk factors (prenatal depression, stressful life events and relationship dissatisfaction), hierarchical regression was used to assess the relationship between sleep variables and depression scores at T4. Results: On average, sleep duration and quality were highest before pregnancy, lowest in late pregnancy and did not return to non-pregnant levels by 3 months postpartum. There were no differences in depression scores by demographic factors. The prevalence of PND was 7.8% of this sample (EPDS ≥ 13) and scores ranged from 0 to 25. Postnatal sleep duration was independently related to symptoms of PND (β = -0.390, p < 0.001). Postnatal sleep quality was also independently associated with symptoms of PND (β = -0.398, p < 0.001). Higher depression scores were associated with shorter and poorer quality sleep, and were seen among women whose sleep continued to decline after birth, or whose sleep changes across time were large. Conclusion: Large changes from habitual sleep, or continued declining sleep quantity and quality into the postpartum period, were associated with higher depression scores. It is recognised that aspects of this relationship may be bidirectional. Enquiring about sleep is straight forward and clinically important when screening for and attending to PND.

N2  - This study was conducted to identify factors that influenced stress, healthy eating and physical activity among low-income overweight or obese pregnant women. We conducted seven focus groups with 96 low-income overweight and obese pregnant women. Common themes were identified from audio tapes and transcripts. Women said that poor communication affected their relationships with spouses or significant others. They were frustrated or upset with significant others for three key reasons: failure to understand or listen to the pregnant women's pregnancy concerns, refusal to be helpful when asked and being overly concerned with the woman's safety. Most women said that they were emotional and took naps throughout the day after becoming pregnant. Many withdrew from their social interactions. They also faced numerous challenges that made healthy eating more difficult, e.g., craving for unhealthy foods and eating foods for comfort. To eat healthier, some reminded themselves to avoid overeating or stop eating in the car. Women were not physically active because of tiredness, lack of motivation, inadequate social support, or bad weather. Some stayed physically active to prevent excessive pregnancy weight gain and have an easier labor. Women equivocally said weighing themselves to manage weight would add to their stress and make them feel more depressed. When designing interventions to help low-income overweight and obese pregnant women avoid excessive pregnancy weight gain, it is important to include information and practical advice on stress management, emphasizing effective communication skills with significant others and helping them plan effective ways to manage negative feelings.

N2  - Introduction: Recent findings indicate that EPO, IL-6 and IGFBP-1/2 are significantly increased while IGF-1 is down-regulated in the cord blood of infants who experienced maternal OSAS during gestation, suggesting an abnormal brain development. We previously reported that maternal intermittent hypoxia (IH) exposures during pregnancy lead to brain white matter injury (WMI) in mouse offspring. In the present study, the potential underlying mechanism was investigated. Methods: Timed pregnant mice (between 8.5-18.5 day-post-coitus) were exposed to IH for 10 days (8% 02/20.9% 02/120s switch/12 hrs during the light cycle), or intermittent air (IA). After gestational IA or IH exposures, pregnant mice were immediately terminated for embryo collection or transferred to room air conditions for delivery. The perinatal brain tissues were collected at different post-exposure days for immunostaining and Western blots. The statistical significance was considered as p < 0.05. Results: The cytosolic and membrane-bound components of NADPH oxidase and its activity were significantly elevated in fetal brains subjected to maternal IH exposures. Meanwhile, expressions of iNOS and eNOS, but not nNOS, were enhanced in maternal IH-exposed fetal brains. A large amount of superoxide, lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation were produced in e18.5 fetal brains by detecting 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and nitrotyrosine (NT). Contrasting to WMI in offspring after birth, neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis were disturbed after 10 days of maternal IH exposures at e18.5 by inhibited expression of NeuroD2, MAP2, phosphorylated GAP43, and synapsin I, however, all changes return to normal levels after birth, suggesting a quick recovery occurring when maternal IH exposures were withdrawn. Administration of apocynin, a selective inhibitor of NADPH oxidase complex, to IH-exposed pregnant mice prevents lipid peroxidation/protein tyrosine nitration and restores myelin/axon proteins in perinatal brains. Conclusion: These findings suggest that NADPH-Oxidase mediated oxidative stress may play an important role in the pathogenesis of adverse fetal outcomes, including perinatal WMI.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep tends to worsen as pregnancy progresses, and research suggests by the third trimester between 20-30%) of women experience clinically significant insomnia. Patient preferences are increasingly being recognized as an important factor in the delivery of evidence-based interventions. Although several treatments are available for insomnia during pregnancy, little is known about how these interventions are perceived by those who could benefit from them. Our investigation examined perceptions of three insomnia treatments among pregnant women: pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), and acupuncture. Methods: The sample (N = 54) was primarily white (63%) and employed (68.5%). As measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), 40.7%) of the women had significant complaints of insomnia. Participants were asked to read treatment descriptions of each intervention, and to complete questionnaires assessing their perceptions of the treatment. The questionnaires included the Credibility Scale (CS), to assess how credible the participants perceived each treatment to be, and Personal Reactions to the Rationale Scale (PRR), to assess the perceived usefulness of the treatment to the participant. Results: Ratings of treatment credibility differed significantly between all groups (F 2,106 = 22.71, p < 0.001) with CBT-I rated as more credible than acupuncture (t(53) = 2.66, p = 0.01) as well as pharmacotherapy (t(53) = 6.62, p < 0.001), and acupuncture as more credible than pharmacotherapy (t(53) = 3.99, p < 0.001). Similarly, participants' personal reactions also differed (F 2,106 = 38.91, p < 0.001), with CBT-I rated more favorably than acupuncture (t(53) = 3.72, p < 0.001) and pharmacotherapy (t(53) = 8.68, p < 0.001), and acupuncture rated more favorably than pharmacotherapy (t(53) = 5.10, p < 0.001). When forced to choose a treatment, acupuncture was selected most frequently (52%), followed by CBT-I (38%), and pharmacotherapy (10%). Conclusion: Findings suggest that pregnant women are likely to choose psychotherapy or acupuncture for treatment of insomnia, as they have more favorable perceptions of these treatments relative to pharmacotherapy.

N2  - Introduction: Women complain more of sleep than do men, but little is known about the relation to the macro- and microstructure of sleep and how age affect this relation. This was the topic of the present study. Methods: Ambulatory polysomnographical (PSG) recordings were obtained in a representative sample of 400 non-pregnant women (oversampling of snorers) and analysed through automatic analysis and manually verified. Sleep quality ratings (poor, rather poor, average, good, very good sleep) at awakening after recording and age (cutoff 50.1 years) were related to PSG-derived data using ANOVA (300 participants after exclusions). Results: Significant association between sleep quality ratings (good vs poor) and age and PSG measures were obtained for sleep efficiency (91 ± 2 vs 83 ± 2% for young participants and 85 ± 2 vs 72 ± 2% for older participants), WASO, Changes to Stage wake, and Stage changes/h). Stage 1% and increased with poor sleep (no age effect). Number of sleep spindles increased with poor sleep in young subjects only, while K-komplexes and spectral data (delta, theta, beta power in NREM or REM) were not related to sleep quality. Also total sleep time increased with good sleep and young age (418 vs 373 min for young participants and 386 vs 328 min for older participants. For most PSG variables Good sleep in the older group corresponded to poor sleep in the younger group. Conclusion: Reported sleep quality is clearly related to PSG indicators of sleep continuity in a large, representative group of women, but age will change the PSG values characterizing good and poor sleep.

N2  - Background: More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low back pain (LBP) that interferes with everyday activities, work and sleep. Most women receive very little in the way of treatment and are usually advised to self-manage. Acupuncture appears a safe, promising intervention used by some physiotherapists but there are no high quality trial data regarding its clinical or cost-effectiveness, in comparison to standard care. Evaluation of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in a future randomised controlled trial (RCT) is required, but before this can be done, a feasibility and pilot trial was needed. Purpose: To assess the feasibility of a future large RCT testing the additional benefit of acupuncture to standard care for pregnancy-related LBP. Methods: A single-centre pilot RCT. Participants were identified using six methods and randomised to one of three interventions delivered by physiotherapists. Standard Care (SC): A self-management booklet and onward referral for one-to-one physiotherapy (2 to 4 sessions) for those who needed it. SC plus true acupuncture: The self-management booklet and 6 to 8 treatments with a physiotherapist comprising true (penetrating) acupuncture, advice and exercise. SC plus non-penetrating acupuncture: The self-management booklet and 6 to 8 treatments with a physiotherapist comprising non-penetrating acupuncture, advice and exercise. Pilot RCT outcomes included recruitment rates, treatment fidelity, follow-up rate, patient-reported pain and function, quality of life and exploration of healthcare costs. Birth and neonatal outcomes were also assessed. Trial registration: Current controlled trials database ISRCTN49955124. Results: We recruited 125 of 280 potentially eligible women (45%) in 6 months and randomised 41 to SC, and 42 to each of the SC plus acupuncture arms. Most participants were identified through questionnaires given to women at routine 20-week ultrasound scan appointments, community midwives informing women of the study and women self-referring following local awareness-raising. The consent meetings were audio recorded and indicate that women had no concerns about the use of acupuncture in pregnancy beyond the need for reassurance on positioning and safety. 10% of women (n = 4) randomised to SC alone accessed one-to-one physiotherapy and they received an average of 2 treatments. The average number of treatments was 6 for SC plus true acupuncture and 6 for SC plus non-penetrating acupuncture. Treatments were in line with protocols. 8-Week follow-up was 74%. Patient-reported outcomes (pain, function and quality of life) favoured the addition of acupuncture. Healthcare costs were higher for SC plus true acupuncture, due to the additional cost of the intervention. There was no evidence of serious adverse events on mothers, birth or neonatal outcomes. The Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire was found to be an appropriate outcome measure for a future trial. Conclusion(s): A future main RCT is feasible and would be welcomed by women and clinicians. Longer-term follow-up and further efforts to maximise follow-up are recommended for a main trial. Implications: A full RCT is feasible and would provide important information for patients, clinicians and decision makers about the effectiveness of acupuncture for this client group.

N2  - Background Postpartum mental disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, psychosis) are serious conditions that affect approximately 10-15% of women after childbirth, and up to 40% of women at risk for these disorders. Research reveals an association between poor sleep quality/quantity and symptoms of anxiety, depression and psychosis. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence for the relationship between sleep and postpartum mental disorders. Methods Searches included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and EBSCOHost CINAHL through June 30, 2014. Manual searching was performed on reference lists of included articles. Published primary research in any language was included. Results There were 3187 unique titles/abstracts and 44 full-text articles reviewed. Thirty-one studies were included. Evidence was found for the impact of self-reported poor sleep during pregnancy and the postpartum on the development of postpartum depression, with not enough evidence for either postpartum anxiety or psychosis. The evidence for objectively assessed sleep and the development of postpartum disorders was mixed. Among the 31 studies included, 1 was strong, 13 were moderate and 17 were weak. Limitations Research design, method of assessment, timing of assessment, recruitment strategies, representative adequacy of the samples and inclusion/exclusion criteria all varied widely. Many studies did not use tools validated for the perinatal population and had small sample sizes without power analysis. Conclusions Sleep interventions represent a potential low-cost, non-pharmacological prevention and treatment strategy for postpartum mental illness. Further high-quality research is needed on this topic area.

N2  - Background: Back pain affects more than two thirds of women during pregnancy, interfering with their everyday activities, work and sleep; yet few pregnant women receive much in the way of treatment for their pain. Acupuncture is a safe and promising intervention, and while already used by some physiotherapists to treat pregnancy-related back pain, practice varies. Phase 1 of the EASE Back (Evaluating Acupuncture and Standard care for pregnant wom En with BACK pain ISRCTN49955124I) project consisted of a mixed methods study of two parts: Part A - a National UK survey of physiotherapists to explore current practice, including use of acupuncture and Part B - focus groups and interviews with midwives, physiotherapists, and women. This paper reports on the focus groups and interviews with physiotherapists. Purpose: Main objective: To explore physiotherapists' perceptions and experiences of back pain in pregnant women. Secondary objective: To inform and optimise the education programme for physiotherapists in the second phase of the EASE Back study: a feasibility and pilot trial. Methods: A qualitative phenomenological study with theoretical sampling was adopted to ensure a range of experience and perspectives of physiotherapists: 3 focus groups and 3 semi-structured interviews were undertaken. Twentyone physiotherapists with musculoskeletal experience, who agreed to be contacted having responded to the national survey, were invited to participate in the interviews and physiotherapists for the focus groups were invited from the healthcare sites where Phase 2 would be delivered. All interviews were digitally recorded, lasted 45 to 60 minutes and were fully transcribed. An iterative exploratory thematic analysis was adopted, using the research aims as a focus. An audit trail was created to ensure transparency of the research process and the decisions made. Results: Three themes emerged: physiotherapists' perceptions of back pain in pregnancy; physiotherapists' experience and confidence in treating pregnant women and the role and safety of acupuncture in pregnancy. Key findings include: • a perceived lack of knowledge of pregnancy related musculoskeletal changes for some participants • a perceived lack of confidence in the use acupuncture in pregnancy • a pervasive professional culture of caution, particularly relating to fears of inducing early labour and the threat of litigation. Conclusion(s): Despite many physiotherapists using acupuncture for musculoskeletal pain and evidence that acupuncture is effective and safe in pregnancy-related back pain, our findings suggest that in this sample many physiotherapists articulated a reluctance to use acupuncture in the management of this patient group. Implications: These findings were key in informing the content of the training programme for the EASE Back pilot randomised trial but should also inform future acupuncture education for physiotherapists.

N2  - Introduction: The Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST) questionnaire is a widely used instrument that assesses an individual's vulnerability to experience situational insomnia under stressful condition. The present study aimed to evaluate the construct validity and factor structure of the Spanish language version of FIRST questionnaire (FIRST-S) in early pregnancy. Methods: A cohort of 647 women were interviewed at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation. The factorial structure of the FIRST-S was tested through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA). Internal consistency and construct validity were also assessed by evaluating the association between the FIRST-S with symptoms of depression, anxiety and sleep quality (using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). To complement classical test theory (CTT) approaches item response theory (IRT) analyses were conducted. Results: The mean score of the FIRST-S was 13.8 (range: 9-33). The results of the EFA showed that the FIRST-S contained a one factor solution which accounted for 69.8%) of the variance. The FIRST-S items showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.81). The CFA results corroborated the EFA with good comparative fit index (0.902) and acceptable root mean square error value (0.057), indicators of goodness of fit and reasonable error of approximation. Sleep disturbance after getting bad news during the day (r = 0.62) and after an argument (r = 0.62) were the two items with the largest item-total correlation while the smallest component-total correlation were noted for sleep disturbance after watching a frightening movie or TV show (r = 0.33) and before having to speak in public (r = 0.35). The FIRST-S had good construct validity as demonstrated by its statistically significant associations with sleep quality, antepartum depression and anxiety symptoms. Finally the IRT methods suggested excellent item infit and outfit measures. Conclusion: The FIRST-S was found to have good construct validity and internal consistency for assessing vulnerability to insomnia during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: During pregnancy, maternal sleep complaints are emerging health concerns as they are associated with several harmful consequences to their children. But few researches evaluated the effects of microglia on offspring with maternal sleep deprivation (MSD). In this study, it was investigated the effect of MSD on cognition, neuro-development and inflammation in prepuberty offspring rats. Methods: Sleep deprivation was performed using modified small-platforms method. Pregnant Wistar rats received sleep deprivation for 72 h on gestational day (GD) 4, 9, and 18, respectively. The male prepuberty offspring (21 days old) were used in the experiments. Cognitive function was examined by Morris Water Maze for 7 days. Hippocampal neurogenesis (BrdU+/DCX+ cells) was estimated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Inflammatory cytokines were determined by Real Time PCR and IHC. The microglial state was confirmed by ELISA and IHC. The prepuberty male offspring with MSD were given the intraperitoneal injections with minocycline (50 mg/kg) for 5 days to inhibit microglial activation. Results: MSD impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory in the Morris Water Maze task, and decreased the number of BrdU+/DCX+ cells in prepuberty offspring, especially in the late MSD young rats (sleep deprivation on GDI 8). The pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα) increased and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) decreased and the Ibal+ microglia activated in late MSD offspring. After injected minocycline, the classical microglial activation (Ml phenotype) was inhibited, and promoted the alternative microglial activation (M2 phenotype). The cognition and neurogenesis were improved after minocycline administration. Conclusion: MSD-induced microglial activation is involved in impaired of neurogenesis and cognitive function in the prepuberty offspring.

N2  - Introduction: Acculturation in the U.S. is associated with poor health outcomes, yet relatively little is understood about its role in sleep, specifically among pregnant women. One previous study among pregnant Latinas found that those who chose to complete study measures in English, a proxy for acculturation, had higher insomnia severity. The current study aimed to examine if acculturation, measured using a validated scale, predicted insomnia severity among pregnant women with insomnia disorder. Methods: Pregnant women with insomnia disorder (gestational ages 18-32 weeks) were enrolled in a treatment study of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI). Eligible women who met DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder and had no co-morbid affective or sleep disorders were recruited from community obstetric clinics. At baseline, participants completed the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II (ARSMA-II) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) among other measures. Results: Twenty one of 39 women (mean age 32.9 ± 4.9 years; mean gestational age 24 weeks ± 4.5 weeks) self-identified as having been born and raised in a non-Anglo culture. Of these women, 48%) were Latina. The ISI average score was 18.2 ± 4.1. A multiple regression model that included the two ARSMA-II subscales, Anglo Orientation Scale (AOS) and Culture of Origin Orientation Scale (COS), explained a significant amount of variance in ISI scores [p < 0.05, R2Adjusted = 0.24]. AOS significantly predicted ISI scores (Beta = 0.62, p = 0.01) but COS did not (p = 0.08). Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that, among pregnant women with insomnia disorder, greater cultural orientation toward the Anglo culture is associated with more severe insomnia severity, but greater cultural orientation toward the culture of origin is not. Future research is needed to better understand mechanisms underlying the observed relationship between acculturation and insomnia and the clinical relevance of acculturation in terms of response to CBTI.

N2  - Purpose: Topiramate (TPM) is an increasingly used drug during childbearing ages for treatment of epilepsy, migraine, and appetite suppression as well as for off-label indications such as sleep and psychiatric disorders. Presently, while some reports suggested an increased risk of oral cleft (OC), these reports are balanced by studies that could not confirm such association. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the risk for OC in the newborns of women treated with TPM during the first trimester of pregnancy. Methods: Databases were searched using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science from January 1 1996 to 30 October 2014. Studies were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: cohort or case-control studies that reported fetal outcome after exposure to any dose of TPM during the first trimester of pregnancy and compared the outcome with that of an unexposed control group. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the quality of the articles. We calculated the odds ratios using a random effects model. Results: Of the 2327 publications reviewed, 6 papers met the inclusion criteria including 3420 patients and 1,204,981 controls. The meta-analysis of six controlled studies on pregnant women exposed to TPM during the first trimester detected that the rate of OC in this group was statistically increased compared with the unexposed group and that there was no heterogeneity among the included studies. The OR of OC after TPM exposure was 6.26 (95% confidence interval: 3.13-12.51; P=0.00001). Conclusions: This study provides strong evidence that TPM is associated with an increased risk of OC in infants exposed to TPM during embryogenesis and should lead to a careful review of TPM use in women of reproductive ages.

N2  - Introduction: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a condition associated with significant pathophysiologic sequelae, including intermittent hypoxemia and hypertension, and the presence of OSA during pregnancy has been associated with untoward consequences to both the mother and fetus. We studied the impact of maternal OSA during pregnancy in a group of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Objective: The objective of our study was to determine if excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and/or snoring were associated with unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. Methods: The study group consisted of postpartum mothers who had delivered an infant that was admitted to the NICU. Mothers were randomly selected and they were asked to complete two standardized questionnaires (Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Snoring Symptoms Inventory) to identify symptoms of OSA, specifically, EDS and snoring. Maternal data regarding age, race, health status, pregnancy, labor and delivery were collected. Infant data regarding gestational age, birth weight, and Apgar scores were obtained. Results: We enrolled 115 mothers in this study. Their mean age at study entry was 34 ± 5 years. Seventy percent of the participants were Caucasian, 18% Hispanic, 6% African-American, and 5% Asian. Smoking and alcohol use were reported in 2%. Most deliveries were via elective c-section (42%), followed by NSVD (32%), and emergency c-section in 24%). A high correlation between the ESS and the SSI was seen. The relationship of ESS and SSI totals to pregnancy outcomes was analyzed. Elevated scores on the SSI were associated with higher maternal Hb and Hct at delivery, and preeclampsia. Elevated SSI scores correlated with an increased incidence of gestational diabetes, and both preeclampsia and gestational diabetes correlated with the incidence of fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). We also found that high SSI totals were associated with lower 5 minute Apgar scores in the newborns at birth. Conclusions: Maternal OSA was seen in a significant percentage of infants in a NICU. Although long term outcome studies are needed, maternal OSA is associated with conditions that suggest poor fetal and neonatal outcomes.

N2  - A warning was issued recently by The European Medicines Agency thatdue to its teratogenic effects, valproate should not be used in femalechildren, women of childbearing potential and pregnant women unlessalternative treatments are ineffective or not tolerated. This is of concernto pediatric neurologists as valproate is one of the major drugs used intreating pediatric epilepsy.Based on recent major prospective registry studies, fetal exposure tovalproate monotherapy is associated with a significantly increased riskof major congenital malformations when compared to children exposedto carbamazepine, or lamotrigine in utero. The teratogenic effect ofvalproate appears to be dose-related; daily doses not exceeding 600 mgare not significantly different from carbamazepine over 500 mg/day orlamotrigine over 300 mg/day. Reported outcomes after levetiracetamexposure are not alarming but the numbers are relatively small. Dataon topiramate or oxcarbazepine are very scarce.Valproate is also associated with functional teratogenicity. Prospective registry studies have reported a significant IQ reduction (average7-11 points) in valproate-exposed children compared to children exposedto carbamazepine, lamotrigine or phenytoin. Also this effect seems tobe dose-related; IQ outcomes after exposure to less than 800-1000 mg/day are similar to those for the other studied drugs. Prenatal exposureto valproate has also been associated with an increased risk of autisticspectrum disorder. Data on functional teratogenicity of all other AEDsare insufficient.The efficacy of valproate against primary generalized tonic-clonic,myoclonic and absence seizures has been shown by randomized controlledtrials (RCT), but no syndrome-specific RCTs have been conducted exceptfor childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). The double-blind trial included 453children with newly diagnosed CAE and compared valproate, ethosuximide and lamotrigine. Valproate was found to be more effective thanlamotrigine and equally effective with ethosuximide, while ethosuximidewas better tolerated.For focal seizures in general, current evidence do not support usingvalproate as a first line treatment. In children, focal seizures may arisein the context of certain childhood epilepsy syndromes, such as epilepsywith continuous spike-waves during sleep (CSWS or ESES syndrome),atypical benign focal epilepsy and Dravet syndrome. In these conditions, valproate is an appropriate first choice for treating focal seizures andother seizure types, as sodium channel blockers, such as carbamazepine,oxcarbazepine or lamotrigine may exacerbate both seizures and neurocognitive dysfunction.For defined pediatric epilepsy syndromes other than CAE, onlyobservational data on treatment are available. Based on these reportsand expert concensus, valproate may be considered as an appropriateinitial treatment for myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, atypical benign focalepilepsy, eyelid myoclonia with absences, epilepsy with myoclonic absences,epilepsy with myoclonic atonic seizures, epileptic encephalopathy withcontinuous spike-and-wave waves in sleep, including Landau-Kleffnersyndrome, Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In progressivemyoclonic epilepsies, valproate must be used with caution; because ofthe risk of fatal liver failure, it is contraindicated in some mitochondrialdisorders, especially those with POLG mutations.Valproate remains an important drug in the treatment of many pediatricepilepsy syndromes. Teratogenic concerns are minor in syndromes suchas childhood absence epilepsy which have a high likelihood of remissionand treatment withdrawal before puberty. Valproate may also be used asinitial treatment for children regardless of gender when the epilepsy andconcurrent disabilities are so severe that future pregnancy is extremelyunlikely. For adolescents with new onset idiopathic (genetic) generalizedepilepsy, valproate should be considered as an initial treatment as it maybe more effective than other drugs. As in the case of AED treatment ingeneral, the lowest effective dose should be prescribed, especially whenvalproate is selected for an adolescent girl.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the correlation between quality of life, sleep quality with the body mass index (BMI) in Colombian women. Methods: Cross-sectional study carried out in women aged between 40 and 59 years, residents in areas located in the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Colombia, belonging to Hispanic, Afro-descendant and Indigenous ethnic groups. They participated willingly, in their own communities, anonymously and with informed consent. Hysterectomized and pregnant women were excluded. And a socio-demographic survey, the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Pittsburgh Sleep Index (PSQI) and the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) were applied. The BMI was calculated measuring participants' weight and height. Data is presented in median and interquartile range. The three scales showed an adequate Cronbach's alpha. The Spearman (rs) correlation coefficient was calculated with the statistical program SPSS-15. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Results: 3525 women were involved. Average age: 48.0 [IR:8] years old, number of children born: 3 [IR:2], education level: 11.0 [IR:7] years, diabetic women: 7.7%, women with Arterial Hypertension: 15.5%, usual coffee use: 71.4%, actual smokers: 8.4%, weight: 68 [IR:15] kg, BMI: 25.6 [IR:5.6], underweight: 2.7%, Normal: 41.2%, overweight: 39.1%, obesity-I: 12.4%, obesity-II: 3.8%, obesity-III: 0.6% and hormone therapy use: 11.5%. According to the menopause status: premenopause: 32.3%, perimenopause: 19.4%, postmenopause: 48.2%. A weak positive correlation was noticed between BMI and somatic-vegetative (rs = 0.20), psychological (rs = 0.17) and urogenital deterioration (rs = 0.15) and quality of life (rs = 0.2). p < 0.001. The correlation between BMI and sleep quality (rs = 0.020) and insomnia (rs = 0.004) were not significant. Conclusion: In a Colombian women group, the BMI had a weak positive correlation with quality of life and the domains of the MRS. However, neither quality of sleep nor insomnia had a significant correlation with the BMI.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has been associated with a range of neurocognitive effects, including decreased executive function. Emerging research suggests that these children are also at increased risks for sleep problems, which may in turn exacerbate the neurocognitive symptoms. This systematic review explores the body of primary research literature surrounding the relationship between children's sleep and circadian problems caused by PAE and daytime neurocognitive impairment. Methods: We developed a detailed search string to capture relevant studies in both humans and animal models in PubMed. Studies in which the mother had consumed alcohol during pregnancy, and sleep or circadian functioning was measured in the offspring were included; reviews, studies in a language other than English, studies that were not peer-reviewed, and studies in which offspring studied were over 18 years old were excluded. Results: Of the 524 studies yielded from applying our search string in PubMed, 40 studies met inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Sleep problems are common among children with PAE, with 21 studies documenting increased risks in animal models and 19 studies in humans. The specific sleep problems associated with PAE include shorter sleep duration (8 studies), longer onset latency (7 studies), bedtime resistance (4 studies), sleep anxiety (3 studies), and other physiologic abnormalities of sleep (10 studies). Finally, sleep problems in children with PAE are both more severe and prevalent with the presence of co-morbid neurocognitive problems such as ADHD, anxiety, and depression (2 studies). Conclusion: The current state of the literature demonstrates a significantly increased risk of sleep problems among children with PAE; this burden may be translating in turn to a greater neurocognitive burden or decreased family quality of life. What remains unknown is the degree to which these sleep problems can be addressed with treatment, and whether children with PAE will show any amelioration of neurocognitive symptoms with improved sleep, as is seen among children with non-teratogenic behavior and development disorders.

N2  - Introduction: The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common in ex-premature children, and associated with several complications when left untreated. However, it is unknown whether OSAS, in ex-prematures, is associated with specific perinatal risk factors, such as birth weight, Apgar at 5 minutes, maternal race, antenatal corticosteroids, chorioamnionitis, delivery route, gender, and multiple gestation. Considering OSAS is more common in African Americans, and linked with inflammatory markers, we hypothesized that OSAS was associated with maternal race and chorioamnionitis. Methods: 197 ex-premature (500-1,250 g) children aged 5-12 years who participated as neonates in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial (Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity [CAP]) of caffeine versus placebo, underwent full ambulatory polysomnography. A negative binomial regression model was used to identify perinatal risk factors associated with OSAS, defined as obstructive apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 2 events per hour. Results: 19 children had OSAS (9.6%). Chorioamnionitis and multiple gestation were positively associated with OSAS with p values of 0.014 and 0.03, respectively. Caucasian maternal race (p = 0.047) and maternal age (p = 0.002) were negatively associated with OSAS. Other risk factors, such as birth weight, Apgar at 5 minutes, antenatal corticosteroids, delivery route, and gender were not significant. Conclusion: OSAS is very frequent, and associated with chorioamnionitis and multiple gestation in ex-premature children. Those born to older white mothers appear to be protected. We speculate the former may be due to systemic inflammation and the latter to a higher socioeconomic status. Future longitudinal studies are warranted.

N2  - Introduction: An adverse maternal environment can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in adult offspring. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent in pregnant women and may be characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia and placental insufficiency. The incidence of maternal and neonatal outcomes such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weights, cesarean delivery and neonatal intensive care unit admission are increased in pregnant women with OSA. This study examined the effects of gestational IH on endothelial function of the adult offspring of mice fed high fat (HF) diet. Methods: Female WT C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks) were divided in 4 groups: IH or intermittent air (IA) and received either a high fat (HF) or control diet (CD) for one month. Mice were subjected to IH while they were asleep during the daylight cycle; IH was by delivering a hypoxic mixture (12% oxygen) with room air every 30 s; IA received air instead of the hypoxic mixture. Mice were impregnated and kept under IH and received HF diet during the gestation period. After giving birth, IH was halted but the mothers still received HF diet and pups were allowed to breastfeed. After weaning, male mice were maintained on normal diet. Eight weeks later, mice were sacrificed and endothelium-dependent relaxation was measured using a wire myograph. Results: After 2 weeks of delivery, pups in the CD-IH (4.4 ± 0.2 g) and HF-IH (4.0 ± 0.2 g) groups weighed significantly less than the HF-IA and CD-IA groups (7.9 ± 0.2 g, 7.3 ± 0.3 g, respectively, p < 0.001); these differences remained significant for 4 weeks. Subsequently though, HF-IH and CD-IH pups gained weight until there were no significant difference between the groups at 8 weeks of age. Endothelium-dependent relaxation, however, was not significantly different between the groups (Emax HF-IH: 92.1 ± 0.6%, HF-IA: 95.8 ± 0.5%, CD-IH: 94.9 ± 0.7% and CD-IA: 97.6 ± 0.6% of induced tone, p = NS). Conclusion: In mice, chronic gestational IH resulted in significant growth impairment in the offspring but this difference was abolished later in adulthood. Neither gestational IH nor high fat diet caused endothelial dysfunction in the adult offspring.

N2  - Objective: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is one of the more common causes of severe neonatal hypotonia. PWS is seen in 1:15000 newborn. The clinical picture is characteristic and different to that of neuromuscular and metabolic diseases. Early diagnoses is important for treatment. During childhood and adulthood several symptoms will arise, and knowledge about PWS is important for management and survival. Methods: Genetics and clinical picture are described. Results: In PWS paternal genetic information from chromosome 15q is missing, either as paternal deletion 15q, maternal uniparental disomia (UPD) of chromosome 15, or by an imprinting mutation on paternal 15q. PWS can be confirmed by a DNA methylation test. Del 15q (ca. 65% of cases) is detected by an array CGH test. In pregnancy reduced foetal movements, oligo or poly hydramnion can be seen. At birth breech presentation is common. Apgar score is often normal, but followed by severe hypotonia. The child sleeps, does not cry, is not interested in eating or sucking. Breathing is normal. Tube feeding is necessary in weeks or months. Slight dysmorphism ban be seen: Small bifrontal diameter, almond shaped eyes, micrognathia, open triangular mouth, small hands and feet. 95% of boys have cryptorchism. The motor function gradually improves, milestones are delayed. From age 1-2 years a peculiar interest for food and eating arises followed by a morbid obesity, but only if food is not controlled. Growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, abnormal temperature regulation, abnormal sleep pattern, sleep apnea, scolioses, behavioural problems and mild to moderate mental retardation are characteristic. Psychiatric diseases are seen in adults. Conclusion: Early diagnose is important and possible. Many clinical symptoms can be treated successfully to secure quality of life for patients and family. Especially it is possible, to prevent severe overweight and obesity related diseases including early death.

N2  - Introduction: Clinical studies have indicated linkages between sleep duration and C-reactive protein (CRP), a stable inflammatory marker of cardiovascular disease. The present study explored effects of short (8 hrs) sleep durations, referenced to healthy sleep (7-8 hours), on CRP levels among participants in the Modeling the Epidemiologic Transition Study (METS). Methods: We conducted a multi-site comparative study of communities representing a broad range of social and economic development, defined by the UN Human Development Index (HDI): Ghana as low middle HDI country, South Africa as middle, Jamaica and Seychelles as high, and U.S.A. as very high HDI. Participants were predominantly of African descent (n = 1,276; ages 25-44; 50%) female). Sociodemo-graphic and anthropometric data were obtained at outpatient community-based clinics. Individuals were excluded if they had infectious diseases (e.g. HIV-positive), were pregnant/lactating, or had conditions preventing normal physical activities. Results: Of the sample, 54.9% were overweight/obese; 11.7%, hypertension; 2.2%), diabetes; and 4.7, dyslipidemia. Prevalence of short and long sleep durations varied by site. Compared with individuals who reported sleeping 7-8 hours, the U.S. had the highest rate of short sleepers (43.5%), while South Africa had the highest rate of long sleepers (86.5%), X2 = 69.4; p < 0.001. Likewise, CRP levels varied by site (US = 5.9 ± 0.5, South Africa = 7.6 ± 0.7, Ghana = 4.7 ± 0.6, Jamaica = 4.1 ± 0.3, and Seychelles = 3.0 ± 0.2; F = 12.1, p < 0.001); values represent means and standard errors. GLM analysis, adjusting effects of age, sex, BMI and site, showed that short sleep did not have a significant effect on CRP Rather, long sleep had a significant effect on CRP (F = 10.5, p < 0.001). CRP was also affected by sex (F = 11.3, p < 0.001), BMI, (F = 8.7, p < 0.001) and site (F = 9.8, p < 0.001), but not by age. Conclusion: Findings are consistent with experimental studies showing effects of sleep on CRP, although long sleep, rather than, short sleep affected CRP concentrations. Site-specific differences in sleep durations and CRP levels are important, warranting further investigation.

N2  - Introduction: The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy is approximately 5%. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is one of the consequences of OSA. Since the fetus is already exposed to a hypoxic environment, periodic drops in maternal 02 saturation could have negative consequences in the development of the fetus. We hypothesized that maternal exposure to CIH impacts body growth and cardiovascular function in offspring-potentially via an increased sympathetic tone which influences cardiac function, lipid metabolism and long bone growth. Methods: Sprague-Dawley pregnant dams were exposed to CIH (Alternate 1 min of 5% 02 with 1 min of 21% 02 for 8 daytime hours), or room air (controls; C), from pregnancy days 3-19. Studies were done in male offspring (18 CIH and 17 C). At 8 weeks of age, we measured: body weight (BW), tail cuff blood pressure (BP), echocardiography, and, following euthanasia, tibia length (TBL) and total weight of abdominal fat pads (FPW). Results: Compared to C, CIH exposed offspring had significantly lower BW (259 ± 21 vs 278 ± 18 g; p < 0.01) and TBL (32.2 ± 0.68 vs 33.1 ± 0.62 mm; p < 0.01), but higher FPW (4.41 ± 1.02 vs 3.19 ± 1.41 g; p < 0.05), FPW/BW ratio (1.7 ± 0.4 vs 1.4 ± 0.3%; p < 0.05) and FPW/TBL ratios (0.13 ± 0.03 vs 0.10 ± 0.04 mg/mm; p < 0.05). CIH exposed offspring had greater systolic BP (126 ± 23 vs 95 ± 18 torr; p < 0.01), left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (67 ± 6 vs 59 ± 8%; p < 0.01), LV fractional shortening (38 ± 5 vs 33 ± 6%; p < 0.01), stroke volume index (0.72 ± 0.14 vs 0.62 ± 0.11 ul/g; p < 0.05), and LV mass index (5.0 ± 0.5 vs 4.6 ± 0.5 mg/g;p< 0.05). Conclusion: Prenatal CIH exposure affects fetal growth and cardiovascular function during post-natal development. These may increase risks for abdominal obesity, hypertension, and cardiac hypertrophy in adults.

N2  - Introduction: Research has identified low income as a risk for insomnia. Additionally, greater perceived social support is associated with better mental and physical health outcomes. We examined the possibility that social support may moderate the relationship between low income and insomnia symptoms among pregnant women with insomnia disorder (ID). Methods: Thirty-nine women, 17 to 34 weeks pregnant (M= 25.56, SD = 5.25), who met DSM-5 criteria for ID, with no co-morbid depressive, anxiety, or sleep disorders, enrolled in a treatment study of perinatal insomnia. At baseline, participants reported total family income, and completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and one week of sleep diaries. Results: Regression analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses that perceived social support moderates the associated between income and mean self-reported sleep onset latency (SOL), wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO), and early morning awakening (EMA), while controlling for age, gestational week, and depressive symptoms. Lower income (β = -2.39, t = - 2.83,/? = 0.009) and lower perceived social support (β = -0.78, t = -2.71, p = 0.012) were both associated with longer SOL, but not with WASO or EMA. The interaction between income and perceived social support was also a significant predictor of SOL (β = 2.08, t= 2.30, p = 0.031). Conclusion: This study is the first to document that social support may play an important role in the sleep of pregnant women with ID. Specifically, in this sample of treatment-seeking pregnant women with ID, perceived social support buffered the negative effect of low income on SOL, such that income was not associated with SOL among women with high levels of perceived social support. Our findings suggest that social support may serve as a protective factor for ID symptoms, especially among women of low SES.

N2  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has been shown to be associated with several risk factors for stroke, such as obesity, hypertension, and autonomic dysfunction. We thus hypothesize that RLS - especially RLS of greater severity - is associated with subsequent development of stroke. Methods: The current analysis included 72,916 female registered nurses ages 41-58 years in 2005, free of diabetes, stroke, and pregnancy at the baseline. Information on RLS was collected via a questionnaire which was based on International RLS Study Group criteria. The primary outcome was diagnosis of stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic or unknown etiology). We calculated hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for stroke incidence for each RLS group using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for potential confounders, such as age, BMI, smoking, diet, alcohol, menopause status, iron supplement use, family history of stroke, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and sleep. Results: During 6 years of follow-up, we documented 161 incident stroke cases. In the multivariate adjusted model, RLS severity is associated with increased risk of stroke: compared to participants with no RLS, adjusted hazard ratio of stroke in participants with RLS 5-14 times per month was 1.37 (0.72-2.62, 95% CI) and participants with RLS over 15 times per month was 2.07 (1.13-3.77) (p-trend = 0.01). The association was particularly strong for ischemic stroke alone (adjusted HR = 3.52 comparing two extreme RLS categories; p-trend = 0.01). The similar association between RLS symptom severity and stroke was observed with exclusion of individuals with cancer, myocardial infarction, arthritis, or those with stroke onset during the first two years of follow-up. Conclusion: We demonstrate in this prospective study that increased RLS severity is associated with subsequent increased risk of stroke. Appropriate management of cardiovascular risk factors for primary prevention of stroke is indicated for patients with RLS.

N2  - Objective: Rett syndrome is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder and one of the most common causes of mental retardation. The prevalence rate is from 1:10,000 to 1:23,000 live female births. About 80% cases are sporadic caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene located on Xq28. We present the case of 6.6-year-old girl with Rett Syndrome. Methods and results: The patient is first term child,of unrelated young and healthy parents. First uneventful pregnancy, labour in term, spontaneous AS: 8/9, head circumference 34cm. Family history - negative on neurological disease. Psychomotor development seemed normal until the age of 12 months, able to sit, smile, few words. At the age of 13 months she was vaccinated and had febrile convulsions. First time admittted at Department at age of two, she had seazure, loss of previously know language skills, uncontrolled arm movents, sudden yelling. Neuropediatric examination: no clear neurological deficit. Laboratory analysis - normal, MRI - no abnormalities, ABR test - mild hearing loss, ophtalmologist examination - no disturbance. EEG - epileptic activity, so antiepileptic therapy was introduced (valproat). Diagnosis of epilepsy and autism-like behavior. Parents have accused the vaccine (MRM). At the age of 3 year: stereotypical hand movements, complete loss of speech, epileptic activity, sleep disturbances and orthopedic problem, foot deformities. Psychological assessment: IR 22, level of functioning - 11 month. Genetically testing is not a routine method in our hospital, but was done at age of five. Mutations in MECP2 gene have been found. Now she is 6.6 year, has microcephaly, absent ability to talk, she has hyperventilation, stereotyped movements, chorea, can't eat by herself, difficult swallowing, no epileptic activity. Treatment: Occupational, speech and physical therapy. Conclusion: Cytogenetic analysis should be done for epileptics patients with mental retardation.It is an important method for evaluation of mental retardation. At the same time evidence that this case wasn't post-vaccinations autism! RS was clinically defined, while MECP2 have been found in individuals who don't have clinical criteria for RS. Prenatal diagnosis is needed in families with RS daughter.

N2  - The purpose is to analyze CVD risk factors and reveal the correlation with the activity of systemic inflammatory process and cardiovascular risk in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Materials and methods: Fifty women were included into the study. The average age was 55,8 years (32;74). RA was diagnosed by the criteria ACR\EULAR 2010. The average age of the onset of RA was 47 years (30; 73). The average time of RA was 8,8 years (1;31). Results: 98% patients suffering from RA had CVD risk factors. The average number of risk factors for a patient was 7,4 (0;13) at the age of 55+9,5 years. The number of risk factors increases in 1,9 times (p<0,05) every 10 years in people over 55 years. According to the frequency risk factors can be ranked as follows arterial hypertension - 92%, abdominal obesity - 80%, unbalanced diet - 78%, anxiety and depression - 68%, increased cholesterol level - 66%, family history of early CVD - 64%, menopause under 50 years - 56%, obesity - 52%, the decreasing of physical activity - 38%, sleep disturbance - 32%, the pathology of pregnancy - 32%, smoking - 6%, hyperglycemia - 4%, alcohol - 2%. The affected organs were left ventricle hypertrophy - 90%, lower limb arterial calcification - 54%, (Ankle Brachial Index 1,4) - 46%, stenosis of lower limb vessels (0,8) - 8%. The associated clinical conditions were ischemic heart disease in 40 % of patients, transient ischemic attack -18%, chronic kidney disease -8%, increased ESR - 94% ( 37,2 (16;70) mm\h), C- reactive protein (CRP)- 92% (19,2 (0;86,0) mg\L), rheumatoid factor (RF) - 94% (111,1 (0; 602)mg\L); cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP) - 54% (211 (100; 426) unit\ml), blood cholesterol level - 66%, average level - 5,1 (3,1; 10,2) mmol\L. The risk of cardiovascular complications according to the SCORE scale was high and very high in 38% of cases, mild and low risks were in 12%. The correlation between CRP, blood cholesterol level, RF, anti-CCP and the number of risk factors and the severity of the disease was detected. Thus, 52% of patients with increased level of blood cholesterol (p<0,05) had the increased CRP, RF and anti-CCP and vice versa. Conclusion: Thus, the patients with rheumatoid arthritis have the increased risk of CV complications (76%) caused by the great number of risk factors (in average 7,4), at the average age of 55 and in case of atherosclerosis (54%) and pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease the risk factors correlate (in 52%) with the activity of systemic inflammatory process. It should be considered assessing the CV risk in patients with RA.

N2  - Previous interventions have generally not been effective in preventing development of overweight, and at the same time studies suggest that some subgroups are more predisposed to future obesity. Obesity runs in families and the subgroup of children with obese parents is at a much higher risk of becoming obese than children of normal weight parents. Likewise, there is a several fold higher risk of obesity among children from lower than higher socioeconomic status familes, and among those children born with a higher birth weight, those born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy, or those of Hispanic or African American orgin. Generally, the studies targeting predisposed individuals seems more effective in preventing obesity than the studies targeting general populations. However, most previous studies on high risk groups focused on ethnicity or socioeconomic status, only, and hence, there is a need for more studies. The Danish Healthy Start Primary Intervention Study included a total of 963 2-6 year old high risk children, all normal weight at baseline. The intervention, which focused on healthy diet, activity, sleep and stress management, included individual as well as group counselling and teaching in practical skills. The study was recently completed and the preliminary results, which suggest that the intervention was effective in preventing excessive weight development over the 18 months intervention period, will be presented.

N2  - Purpose: Data on the safety of infant exposure to second generation antipsychotics (SGA) during lactation is lacking. The objective of this study was to examine the incidence of reported adverse events in nursing infants whose mothers had used an SGA during lactation and compare them to infants exposed to other psychotropics during lactation and also to infants whose mothers did not have any psychiatric conditions while breastfeeding. Methods: Motherisk is a Teratogen Information service providing information on the safety or risk of exposures in pregnancy and lactation to women, their partners and healthcare providers. The Motherisk database was searched from 2010 to 2014 for charts where a lactation follow-up had been completed. The data were then examined for the outcomes of interest. Results: The study population was divided into three groups: women who took a SGA (n=31, SGA group), women who took another psychotropic but no SGA (n=22, Disease group), and women who did not take an SGA or other psychotropic medications and did not have any psychiatric conditions (n=29, Non-Disease group) during breastfeeding. There was 1 (3.2%) adverse event reported by the mother in her infant in the SGA group, 1 (4.3%) in the Disease group and 1 (3.4%) in the Non-Disease group. The proportion of adverse events was similar in all 3 groups (p=0.67). The reported adverse events included problems getting to sleep, feeding difficulties and breathing problems. Conclusions: No significant concerns were reported in the infants of the women using an SGA during lactation. Also, mothers with a psychiatric illness did not report more concerns than mothers with no psychiatric illness.

N2  - Introduction: Inherited cardiac conditions may underlie some of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); defined as a comprehensive medico-legal autopsy-negative sudden unexplained death of an infant < 12 months of age. Methods: A discovery cohort of 82 Northern European Caucasian SIDS cases with prone sleep position excluded (to enrich for genetic risk) and a replication cohort of 324 Caucasian SIDS cases (203 male, average age 2.9 ± 1.8 months) from the United States underwent a whole exome sequencing (WES)-based molecular autopsy. Following variant alignment and annotation, 92 inherited cardiac condition-susceptibility genes (30 channelopathy and 62 cardiomyopathy) were scrutinized to identify putative pathogenic (PP) and rare functionally significant (RFS) variants. A PP variant was defined as a nonsense/frame-shift mutation or missense mutation previously reported as disease-associated and ultra-rare [i.e. absent in the 1,000 Genome Project, the NHLBI ESP, and local controls]. A RFS variant was defined as a variant with MAF <0.5% in controls but with an abnormal cellular phenotype by in vitro functional characterization. Results: In the discovery cohort, 19/82 cases (23%) had at least 1 PP/RFS variant. Variants were most often identified among the infants who died between 3-6 months of age (p=0.009). In the larger replication cohort, 61/324 cases (19%) had at least 1 PP/ RFS variant. Although there was no significant over-representation of such variants in the 3-6 month age group in the replication cohort, infants found prone had a lower PP yield (2/73; 2.7%) than non-prone infants (8/62; 12.9%; p=0.04). There were no other phenotypic differences between variant-positive and negative cases in regards to sex, co-sleeping, or pregnancy term. Conclusions: Using a very conservative mutation calling approach, ∼10% of Caucasian SIDS cases may have an ultrarare, putatively pathogenic mutation and an additional 10-15% of cases may host a rare but functionally significant variant in a channelopathy/cardiomyopathy-susceptibility gene.

N2  - Objective: The amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is becoming more important to monitor brain activity in premature infants. Studies have shown that early aEEGs correlate with later neurodevelopmental outcome. Various scoring systems for the assessment of aEEGs are being used, which complicates the comparison of published data. The aim of our study was to compare two scoring systems for aEEG and correlate with the neurodevelopmental outcome. Methods: 114 preterm infants (gestational age (GA) <30 weeks of gestation) who had an aEEG within the first 14 days of life and a neurodevelopmental outcome at the age of 2 were retrospectively included into the study. The aEEGs had been analyzed with the aEEG sum score (background activity (BA) = percentage of different background patterns based on gestational age related standard values), the occurrence of sleep-wake cycles (SWC) and seizure activity) and the Burdjalov score (continuity (Co), cyclicity (Cy), amplitude of lower border (LB) and bandwidth span and amplitude of lower border (B) of the aEEGs - regardless of gestational age) and the results had been correlated with the outcome (Bayley Scales (MDI and PDI) at the age of 2). Results: Both total scores (p<0.0001) and the different subscores correlated statistically significant (p<0.0001) with each other. Both total scores showed significant correlation (Burdjalov score p=0.003 and aEEG sum score p≤0.0001) with the outcome. The Burdjalov score showed increasing values with increasing GA, while the aEEG sum score showed no differences in the various GA. Conclusion: Both scoring systems allow a simple classification of aEEGs. The Burdjalov score shows specific differences for the GA, while the aEEG sum score correlates better with the later outcome.

N2  - Objectives: To describe a novel phenotype of neonatal encephalopathy and infantile refractory epilepsy and their genetic and pathological underpinnings. Methods: After unremarkable gestation and delivery, a male newborn presented with profound lethargy immediately after birth. Initial physical exam was otherwise normal with no microcephaly or dysmorphic features. He remained in a state of continuous behavioural sleep - arguably a coma state starting at birth - in the ensuing weeks. EEG was initially normal. Brain MRI, metabolic screen and array CGH were normal. By age 2 months, developmental arrest, hypotonic tetraparesis and head growth deceleration were evident and remained unchanged thereafter. Around that age, seizures were first noticed and included daily focal clonic, myoclonic and tonic seizures that proved resistant to multiple AEDs. EEG revealed multifocal epileptiform discharges and diffuse slowing of background activity.Ictal recordings suggested a migrating pattern of the seizures. Throughout patient's life, eye opening was only noted at the time of tonic seizures. He died at age 16 months from respiratory complications. Results: Brain pathology showed diffuse hypomyelination and mild gliotic changes. The mamillary bodies were conspicuously absent. Microscopically, there were no cytoarchitectural abnormalities but the neocortex showed abundance of type II Alzheimer astrocytes. Whole exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous c.1303C>G missense mutation in the GABRA1A gene, producing a p.L267V substitution. This de novo variant was confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing and is predicted to alter the assembly and functional properties of the GABA receptor. Conclusions: Mutations in GABRA1, encoding the GABA-A receptor alpha-1 subunit, have been associated with generalized epilepsies and more recently childhood epileptic encephalopathies. The present observation expands the spectrum of GABRA1-linked phenotypes to include a severe neonatal-onset encephalopathy featuring a continuous sleep state, infantile refractory epilepsy and distinctive neuropathological abnormalities.

N2  - Background: Three newborns presented with bradycardia and 2:1 AV block caused by markedly prolonged QT interval. Their parents were healthy with normal ECG's. Methods and Results: Patient 1 was born with 2:1 AV block due to prolonged QTc-interval of 640 ms. Intermittent bradycardia had been observed since the 20th gestation week. Propranolol was started and 1:1 AV conduction was restored. At the age of 4months, she had seizures and hypsarrythmia on EEG. Her neurological development was slightly delayed. At 3 years she had syncope during exertion and deep bradycardia during sleep. On echocardiography and MRI, noncompaction cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 20% was diagnosed. She underwent left cardiac denervation and epicardial DDD pacemaker implantation, and showed episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP) during recovery. Cardiac transplantation was considered, but the patient developed cardiac ischemia with hemodynamic compromise and did not respond to resuscitation. Exome sequencing revealed F142I de novo -mutation in CALM1 (calmodulin1) gene disrupting calcium signaling in cardiac cells. The combination of calmodulin defect with non-compaction cardiomyopathy is a new finding. Patient 2 had 2:1 AV conduction in utero. Postnatally, QTc was 650 ms with T wave alternans and intermittent 2:1 conduction. There was no syndactyly. Echocardiography showed noncompaction cardiomyopathy. An epicardial DDD-pacemaker was implanted, and propranolol therapy 4 mg/kg/day was instituted. At the age of 6 weeks she died suddenly. Non-compaction cardiomyopathy was confirmed in pathologic specimens of the heart. LQT8 (Timothy syndrome) was diagnosed with de novo G406R mutation in CACNAC1 gene. Patient 3 had intermittent AV block in utero. After birth 2:1 AV conduction and QTc of 530 ms were observed. Repetitive TdP bursts were controlled with esmolol infusion and later with propranolol. VVI-pacing was instituted at the age of 2 weeks and upgraded to DDD-pacing at 4 years. She is doing well. A homozygous LQT2 gene defect L552S (Finnish founder mutation) was diagnosed. Conclusions: Newborns with 2:1 AV conduction and extremely prolonged QT have poor prognosis. Two of our three patients died; both had also non-compaction cardiomyopathy. One death was probably arrhythmogenic, the other one due to ischemia. Genetic testing may provide exact diagnosis.

N2  - Background: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) mainly affects young obese women. Aetiology of IIH is incompletely understood. Some medications and disorders such as hormonal disturbances, anemia and coagulopathy have been reported more frequently among IIH patients. However, results are inconclusive. Aim: To investigate pharmacological treatments and comorbidity before diagnosis of IIH. Method: The Swedish Patient Register identified 124 patients with a diagnosis of IIH (ICD-10 code G93.2) at Karolinska University Hospital during 2006-2013. We reviewed the medical records to validate the diagnosis and collect information on possible risk factors such as pharmacological treatments and comorbidity before diagnosis of IIH. Results: Totally 95 patients (77%) had a correct diagnosis and were included in the study. Excluded patients received diagnosis by mistake, initial suspicion or incomplete investigation. The female/male ratio was 5,3:1. Males were older at the time of diagnosis, 60% where ≥40 years old compared with 17% among females. 11% were exposed to tetracyclines and 7% to corticosteroids in the year preceding diagnosis of IIH (all females). 8% of females had a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome and 4% were diagnosed with IIH during pregnancy/postpartum. Among males 20% had obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Disease affecting hormonal systems was reported in 12% of the patients, diabetes in 5%, kidney disease in 5%, coagulation disease in 2% and anemia in 3%. Conclusion: This study showed that tetracyclines and corticosteroids could be associated with IIH among females. The observed comorbidities are mostly associated with hormonal imbalance and obesity.

N2  - Agonists of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) induce a reversible hypoestrogenic state through the down-regulation of LHRH receptors and desensitization of the pituitary. Since endometrial implants are estrogen sensitive, LHRH agonists have frequently been used for medical treatment of endometriosis. Nowadays, LHRH agonists can be considered in general as a second-line medical treatment for endometriosis-related symptoms, as oral therapy with dienogest is as effective and has fewer side effects. However, therapy with LHRH agonists for 3-6 months prior to in vitro fertilization remains the treatment of choice in patients with endometriosis, as it significantly increases pregnancy rates. LHRH agonists are used prior to surgery and as an adjuvant after an operation to prevent recurrence or prolong disease-free intervals. Adverse effects of LHRH agonists are due to hypoestrogenism and include hot flushes, vaginal dryness, loss of libido, sleep disturbances and a diminished bone density which limits the duration of their administration to 6 months. For long-term treatment, add-back of estrogen and/or progestin,/or progestin only with or without bisphosphonates, can be used, but existing studies only cover a 12-month period of treatment. LHRH antagonists competitively block the pituitary receptors for LHRH. Consequently, a partial pharmacological hypophysectomy with a reduction of the estrogen levels to a desired level is possible if LHRH antagonists are adequately dosed. As endometriotic implants require relatively high levels of estrogen, partially lower plasma levels of estrogens are sufficient to prevent the loss of bone density. A long-term treatment without add-back therapy is also possible.

N2  - Fetal behavioral states are defined by fetal movement and heart rate variability (HRV). At 32 weeks of gestational age (GA) the distinction of four fetal behavioral states represented by combinations of quiet or active sleep or awakeness is possible. Prior to 32 weeks, only periods of fetal activity and quiesence can be distinguished. The increasing synchronization of fetal movement and HRV reflects the development of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) control. Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) detects fetal heart activity at high temporal resolution, enabling the calculation of HRV parameters. This study combined the criteria of fetal movement with the HRV analysis to complete the criteria for fetal state detection. HRV parameters were calculated including the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal R–R interval (SDNN), the mean square of successive differences of the R–R intervals (RMSSD, SDNN/RMSSD ratio, and permutation entropy (PE) to gain information about the developing influence of the ANS within each fetal state. In this study, 55 magnetocardiograms from healthy fetuses of 24–41 weeks’ GA were recorded for up to 45 min using a fetal biomagnetometer. Fetal states were classified based on HRV and movement detection. HRV parameters were calculated for each state. Before GA 32 weeks, 58.4% quiescence and 41.6% activity cycles were observed. Later, 24% quiet sleep state (1F), 65.4% active sleep state (2F), and 10.6% active awake state (4F) were observed. SDNN increased over gestation. Changes of HRV parameters between the fetal behavioral states, especially between 1F and 4F, were statistically significant. Increasing fetal activity was confirmed by a decrease in PE complexity measures. The fHRV parameters support the differentiation between states and indicate the development of autonomous nervous control of heart rate function.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We present a not-so-frequent example of how Cambodia carried-out unconventional and comprehensive evaluation on epilepsy to identify challenges but opportunities. BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a major neurological disorder and least investigated in Asia. It suffers from many by-default conclusions and preset procedures. METHODS: A series of population-based representative surveys were conducted among residents (1 year age) of 24 random villages of Prey Veng. All were diagnosed by a neurologist, and each case had two matched controls from the same population. Several new instruments were developed and validated for field application. All cases received phenobarbital and valproate as a monotherapy and in minimum possible dose. RESULTS: Based on 96 cases and 192 controls, prevalence of lifetime epilepsy was 5.8/1000; prevalence of active epilepsy was 5.4/1000. By villages, epilepsy prevalence varied from 012.5/ 1000. About 53[percnt] were males and 66[percnt] were <20 years of age. Majority of them (80.1[percnt]) had generalised epilepsy. About 86000 people were estimated to have epilepsy in Cambodia. Epilepsy was highly related to pregnancy and birthrelated factors; validating “reproductive causality of epilepsy”. About 41[percnt] cases were estimated to be preventable, should risk factors are removed. Seizure precipitants were frequent particularly having seizures within one hour of wakingup, lack of sleep, stoppage of treatment, etc. There were: denial (8.3[percnt]), concealment (6.2[percnt]), social support (90[percnt]), mean selfesteem (7.5, range 08), mean discrimination (1.0, range 07), mean epilepsyrelated fear (6.4, range 612), coping strategies (72[percnt] look for treatment, 1[percnt] to isolate themselves). Absolute treatment gap was 65.8[percnt]. Changing treatmentdelivery method from home-based to primary health-center based led to 75[percnt] reduced treatment access, 300[percnt] increased epilepsy-related complications and 63[percnt] increased seizure frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Taking an unconventional, comprehensive route to study epilepsy led to discovery of opportunities and what people “expect from us”. Other countries should emulate our model to study epilepsy.

N2  - The majority of expectant women experience progressively more disturbed, fragmented, and shortened nocturnal sleep as a result of normal physiological adaptations to the progressing pregnancy. Emerging evidence indicates that insufficient quantity and poor sleep quality are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and gestational diabetes. When sufficient nighttime sleep is not possible or unattainable, certain strategies, such as daytime naps, can be implemented to counteract the negative effects of disturbed nocturnal sleep. In the current study we examined self-reported napping behavior collected longitudinally via sleep diaries from women in early gestation (10-20 weeks). We identified the frequency and length of naps and whether there were any associations with both diary and actigraphy assessed nocturnal sleep parameters. Participants included 161 pregnant women recruited and evaluated in early gestation. Daily sleep information was collected in three two-week periods, at T1 (10-12), T2 (14-16), and T3 (18-20 weeks gestation) with a daily sleep diary and an actigraph. The average number of naps, as well as the average length of each nap, were calculated from sleep diaries. Women were categorized first as Non-nappers (0 Naps/2-weeks); Moderate Nappers (1-3 Naps/2-weeks); or Frequent Nappers (≥4 Naps/2-weeks); then based on the average nap length as short (< 90 minutes) or long (≥ 90 minutes). Nocturnal sleep parameters included SOL, WASO, SE and TST. SAS procedure MIXED was used for modeling the main effects of NAP group and time, and time by NAP group interactions. Women who took naps had a decrease in diary-assessed nocturnal TST, but not actigraphy-assessed TST. This observation was group and time specific. There were no other group differences. Women who napped ≥ 90 minutes had poorer diary-assessed SE and lower diary-assessed TST compared to those who took shorter naps. Length of nap was not associated with any other sleep measures. Daytime naps slightly impact nocturnal sleep duration, but do not impair sleep continuity or sleep quality among pregnant women. We propose that daytime naps provide a beneficial countermeasure to the sleep disruption commonly reported by pregnant women. This may be clinically beneficial given that sleep continuity and quality are important correlates of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Objective: This study sought to characterize sleep patterns and sleep problems in a large sample of women across all months of pregnancy. Methods: A total of 2427 women completed an Internet-based survey that included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, vitality scale of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Berlin questionnaire, International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) question set, and a short version of the Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory (PSI). Results: Across all months of pregnancy, women experienced poor sleep quality (76%), insufficient nighttime sleep (38%), and significant daytime sleepiness (49%). All women reported frequent nighttime awakenings (100%), and most women took daytime naps (78%). Symptoms of insomnia (57%), sleep-disordered breathing (19%), and restless legs syndrome (24%) were commonly endorsed, with no difference across the month of pregnancy for insomnia, sleep-disorder breathing, daytime sleepiness, or fatigue. In addition, high rates of pregnancy-related symptoms were found to disturb sleep, especially frequent urination (83%) and difficulty finding a comfortable sleep position (79%). Conclusions: Women experience significant sleep disruption, inadequate sleep, and high rates of symptoms of sleep disorder throughout pregnancy. These results suggest that all women should be screened and treated for sleep disturbances throughout pregnancy, especially given the impact of inadequate sleep and sleep disorders on fetal, pregnancy, and postpartum outcomes.

N2  - Background : Throughout the gestational period pregnant women experience a profound disturbance in sleep cycle. Clinical studies had proved that there is a link between disturbance in sleep cycle and inflammatory markers. But evidences have shown that there is a link between inflammatory markers and pregnancy complications. It is seen that persistent sleep disruption can increase inflammation that appears to be long lasting. Objectives : An evaluation has been done in this study to know the relationship between inflammatory markers and sleep disturbances in early, mid and late pregnancy. Material and Methods : 38 pregnant women had been recruited for the study which were evaluated for the sleep disturbances by using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the inflammatory markers Interleukin 6(IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α(TNF-α) were evaluated by various biochemical techniques. Results : it was found that there is a great relationship between sleep disturbances found during different trimester of pregnancy and IL-6 level. But no significant relationship was found between sleep disturbances and TNF-α level. Conclusion : We concluded that women with the worst sleep may be at the greatest risk of pregnancy complications given that similar increases in inflammation have been associated with pregnancy complications.

N2  - Introduction: The prevalence and risk factors of nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in pregnancy and its association with sleep disturbances remains unknown. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study in outpatient and inpatient clinics of a tertiary referral gynaecologic centre and four private practices in Warsaw, Poland. Between June 2011 and June 2014, 349 pregnant women completed questionnaires on sociodemographic and past medical history, GERD symptoms (Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) and a set of questions to assess nocturnal symptoms), and sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)). Nocturnal GERD was defined as presence of any nighttime heartburn and/or acid regurgitation in the past 30 days in patients with GERD diagnosed using RDQ. Results: The overall prevalence of nocturnal GERD was 34.8% (95%CI, 29.8% to 39.8%). Variables significantly associated with nocturnal GERD were trimester of pregnancy (OR 0.33; 95%CI, 0.16-0.71 for the second compared to third trimester, P= 0.005), and family history of GERD in pregnancy (OR 5.21; 95%CI, 2.14-12.68, P<0.001). Of the 121 patients with nocturnal GERD, 37 (30.6%) were using anti-reflux medications, of which all but one were using antacids. In multivariate analyses, nocturnal GERD was significantly associated with poor sleep quality (PSQI>5; OR 2.65; 95%CI, 1.60-4.39, P<0.001) and excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS>10; OR 1.66; 95%CI, 1.00-2.75, P=0.049). Conclusions: The prevalence of nocturnal GERD in pregnancy is high, yet anti-reflux medications were used infrequently. Nocturnal GERD is associated with poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness.

N2  - Background Previously we found that melatonin circadian rhythms were phase advanced in pregnant depressed women (DW) and phase- delayed in postpartum DW. Thus, we sought to test the hypothesis that early night wake therapy (EWT) that delays sleep, would benefit mood in pregnant DW more than late-night wake therapy (LWT) that advances sleep. Methods In 58 women, 31 pregnant (7 DW; 24 healthy women-HW) and 27 postpartum (14 DW; 13 HW), we measured plasma melatonin every 30 min in dim (<50 lux)/dark conditions from 18:00-11:00 h. In 21 DW (7 pregnant, 14 postpartum) and 37 HW (24 pregnant, 13 postpartum), mean age 28 years, we randomized in a cross-over design to EWT (sleep 03:00-07:00 h) vs. LWT (sleep 21:00-01:00 h) followed by a night of recovery sleep (RS-22:30-06:30 h). A clinician administered mood ratings (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-HDRS) pre- and post treatment (after RS). Results At baseline, in pregnancy, DW vs. HW had earlier melatonin offset (p=.045) and lower mean total melatonin (p=0.01), peak (p=.037) and area under the curve (AUC, p=.016); postpartum DW vs. HW had higher mean morning melatonin (p=.031), somewhat higher AUC (p>.05) and shorter melatonin duration (p=.055). Mood scores by HDRS improved with LWT in pregnant (p=.004) and postpartum (p=.014) DW, and with EWT in pregnant (p=.002) and postpartum (p=.011) DW. LWT improved HDRS scores by 48.3 % in pregnant and 46.2 % in postpartum DW; EWT improved mood scores by 57.1 % in pregnant and by 34.5 % in postpartum DW. Melatonin onset (p=.013) and synthesis offset (p=.048) were delayed after EWT in pregnant, but not postpartum DW. Conclusion Both EWT and LWT reduced depressive symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women. In pregnant DW with phase-advanced melatonin offset time, EWT corrected the melatonin abnormality.

N2  - Objective / Background Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) symptoms are common during (late) gestation, due to fluid retention resulting in nerve compression in the wrist. Also it is generally known that depression might interfere with the perception of pain. The objective of the current study is to evaluate a possible independent relation between depression and CTS symptoms during pregnancy. Methods In the ongoing Holistic Approach to Pregnancy and first Postpartum Year (HAPPY) study, 2,500 women are followed from 12 weeks gestation until 12 months postpartum. At 12, 22, and 32 weeks gestation women complete the EDS. At 32 week gestation women also completed the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ). For the current study (n=862), logistic regression analysis was performed, with CTS symptoms as the depending variable and depression during gestation (cutoff EPS: 11) as independent variables, adjusting for BMI prepregnancy, age, and parity. Results 20 % (n=173) of pregnant women reported CTS symptoms during pregnancy. Of these 173 women, 74 % (n=128) presented with bilateral symptoms. Logistic regression analysis showed depression at 22 weeks gestation (O.R.: 2.3, 95 % CI: 1.04 to 4.98) and BMI (O.R.: 1.1, 95 % CI: 1.00 to 1.12) were the only variables significantly associated with CTS symptoms during pregnancy. Conclusion / Discussion Apart from BMI, depression at 22 weeks gestation is an important predictor of CTS symptoms during pregnancy. CTS greatly impairs sleep quality and results in functional impairment. Since one in five pregnant women experience CTS symptoms, it is important to look after CTS, especially in depressed women.

N2  - Objective / Background Insomnia, depression and anxiety are interrelated in the perinatal period. Personality may also influence how women react to the physical and mental challenges of pregnancy and postpartum. We aimed to study whether personality is related to insomnia in pregnant and postpartum women, adjusted for the effects of anxiety and depression. Methods A longitudinal study was conducted among all women attending routine ultrasound check-up at Akershus University Hospital, Norway (November 2008-April 2010). Of 4662 women approached, 3752 (80.5 %) returned the first questionnaire, 2943 returned a second questionnaire in week 32 of pregnancy, and 2386 women replied to a third questionnaire eight weeks postpartum. The “Big Five” personality dimensions were measured by the Mini IPIP scale in week 17. Average sleep durations last month were self-reported and sleep efficiencies calculated. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) measured insomnia, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) measured depressive symptoms, and anxiety was measured by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25). Results Adjusted for the effects of current anxiety, depression, age and parity, the personality traits Neuroticism and Agreeableness were associated with insomnia in week 32 of pregnancy, and Neuroticism with spending longer time in bed. Eight weeks postpartum, no personality traits were associated with insomnia scores when adjusted for current depression and anxiety. Extraversion was associated wit longer sleep duration and better sleep efficiency postpartum, whereas Agreeableness was associated with shorter sleep duration postpartum. Conclusion / Discussion Neuroticism, Extraversion and Agreeableness were personality traits related to different insomnia symptoms in the perinatal period. Neuroticism may be related to more dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, especially in pregnancy, whereas Extraversion may protect against poor sleep efficiency and short sleep duration in the postpartum period.

N2  - Objectives: Poor sleep promotes inflammation. In turn, inflammation is a causal mechanism in term as well as preterm parturition. In the US, a persistent racial disparity in preterm birth exists, with African Americans showing approximately 1.5 times greater risk. This study examined associations among sleep quality, serum proinflammatory cytokines, and length of gestation in a racially diverse sample of 138 pregnant women. Methods: Pregnant women were assessed in the 2nd trimester. Each completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and other psychosocial and behavioral measures. Serum levels of interleukin(IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α were determined by high sensitivity assays. Gestational length was determined via medical record review. Results: Among African American women (n=79), shorter gestation was predicted by poorer overall sleep (rs=-0.35, p=0.002) as well the following PSQI subscales: subjective sleep quality (rs=-0.34, p=0.002), sleep latency (rs=-0.27, p=0.02), and sleep efficiency (rs=-0.27, p=0.02). African American women with poor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) had 3.12 times the odds of preterm birth compared to those with good sleep quality. In contrast, among European American women (n=53), gestational length was not significantly predicted by sleep quality (ps>0.12). Moreover, a significant association between overall sleep quality and IL-8 was present among African American women (rs = 0.30, p = 0.01) but not European Americans (rs = 0.13, p = 0.35). Further, among African Americans only, a modest mediating effect of IL-8 in the relationship between poor sleep and length of gestation was evidenced. Conclusions: These data provide novel evidence that, as compared to European American women, African Americans exhibit greater inflammation in response to sleep disturbance and these effects correspond with length of gestation. Racial differences in susceptibility to sleep-induced immune dysregulation may contribute to marked racial disparities in preterm birth.
