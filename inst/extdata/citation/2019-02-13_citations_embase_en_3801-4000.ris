N2  - Objective: To determine specific sleep characteristics in neonatal opiate withdrawal, referred to as the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), by measuring sleep efficiency, deprivation, disorganization and fragmentation in three groups: (i) healthy term neonates; (ii) opiate-exposed neonates who were treated for opiate withdrawal; and (iii) a group of opiate-exposed neonates who did not require treatment. Methods: A cohort study recording sleep patterns of neonates at 2-10 days of age (after 36 or more weeks of gestation) was carried out. Twenty-one neonates were exposed to opiates during pregnancy and 15 neonates were healthy controls. Sleep characteristics were predefined, and treated newborns were divided into early and stabilized treatment groups. Polygraphic recordings of sleep, movement and breathing were made continuously after a daytime feed. Results: Sleep deprivation, disorganization and fragmentation were found in newborns with NAS and were associated with the severity of the withdrawal. Neonates treated for NAS displayed increased wakefulness during early treatment (deprivation), but were similar to controls once stabilized. Both treated and non-treated groups had reduced amounts of quiet sleep (deprivation). Treated newborns showed an increase in indeterminate sleep (disorganization) and arousals-to-wakefulness (fragmentation). Conclusion: This study determined the exact nature and degree of sleep disturbances in newborns during acute opiate withdrawal. The findings contribute to a further understanding of the physiology underlying neonatal opiate withdrawal and suggest that some changes in sleep are due to opiate withdrawal but others may reflect opiate dependency in utero.

N2  - BACKGROUND: More than a third of women experience back pain during pregnancy. The pain can interfere with work, daily activities and sleep. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the review was to assess the effects of preventive interventions and treatments for pelvic and back pain in pregnancy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (October 2001) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2001). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of any treatment to reduce the incidence or severity of pelvic/back pain in pregnancy, or to prevent pelvic/back pain arising in pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials are included in this review involving 376 women. One randomized trial compared water gymnastics from 20 weeks with no treatment. The authors report less pain in the treatment group but the data are hard to interpret; there was a difference in rates of absence from work after 32 weeks of pregnancy (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence intervals 0.16-0.88). In another trial, acupuncture was rated as giving 'good' or 'excellent' help more frequently than physiotherapy (odds ratio 6.58, 95% confidence intervals 1.0-43.16) but this may reflect the benefit of individual compared with group therapy. One trial of 109 women compared the use of a special shaped pillow to fit under the woman's abdomen (Ozzlo pillow) with a standard pillow. Fewer women rated the Ozzlo pillow of 'little help' compared with the standard pillow (odds ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.58). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Water gymnastics appear to reduce back pain in pregnancy. More women are able to continue at work. Specially shaped pillows help reduce back pain in late pregnancy and improve sleep. It is a pity that the Ozzlo pillow seems no longer to be available. Both physiotherapy and acupuncture may reduce back and pelvic pain. Individual acupuncture sessions were rated as more help than group physiotherapy sessions.

N2  - Background: The pathogenesis of neonatal jitteriness (JT) remains unknown. Neonatal JT could be one of the symptoms associated with drug withdrawal syndrome due to maternal medication. To study the influence of chemicals and environment on brain development in the fetal period, Swaab and Mirmiran proposed 'behavioral teratology'. JT could be one of the targets for this concept. Swaab and Mirmiran postulated that rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM sleep) is useful for studying behavioral teratology. Aim: We aimed to determine the neurophysiological alterations in infants with JT by investigating REM sleep. Study design: Sleep records were obtained three times for each of six jittery infants. The mothers of three infants had been on medication (either alpha-methyl dopa, reserpine or haloperidol) during pregnancy, whereas the mothers of the other three infants took no medication during pregnancy. REM sleep parameters (the amount of REM sleep against the total sleep time, newly designated indices-tonic inhibition index (TII) and phasic inhibition index-, and the incidences of gross movements, phasic chin muscle activity (PCMA), and bursts of rapid eye movements) in the six jittery infants were compared with those in age-matched controls. Results: Regardless of maternal medication, TIIs, which represent the shortening of PCMA during REM sleep, were higher in the jittery infants than in the controls. No other REM sleep parameters showed constant differences between the patients and controls. Conclusion: Release of the blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the fetal brain is considered to be critical for the occurrence of neonatal JT with elevation of TII. Since the abnormal elevation of TII continued after 6 months of age when our patients did not show JT anymore, we have to keep monitoring jittery infants from the standpoint of 'behavioral teratology'.

N2  - Hypericum perforatum is a vegetal compound commonly known as St. John's wort. For decades, it was used in traditional medicine as an astringent, antiseptic and pro-scarring agent externally, and as a treatment for sleep disturbances and depression when orally administered. This plant's mechanism of action is not absolutely clear, but it is seemingly associated with the presence of hypericin, a naphtodianthrone, in its composition. Clinical trials comparing St. John's wort effectiveness versus placebo and standard antidepressants in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression have yielded superior results in the first case, and similar results in the second case. The number of clinical trials, however, is still scarce, and effectiveness extent cannot be definitively concluded. It is well tolerated when administered, and most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue, confusion and sedation. The use of this medicinal plant is absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy, because of its abortive properties. On the other hand, the activity of hyperacin and pseudohyperacin - and of flavonoids included in Hypericum perforatum - as inductors of liver enzymes such as CYP1A2 and glutation-S-transferase may stimulate CYP3A4 and glycoprotein P, and may thus interfere with drugs using the CYP1A2, CYP3A4, glutation-S-transferase and glycoprotein P metabolic routes. Blood concentrations of such drugs would be decreased, and it is thus necessary that concomitant drug use be closely monitored. The recommended daily dose for an adult with mild-to-moderate depression is 0.9 to 2.7 mg hyperacin, which is equivalent to 300-900 mg of Hypericum perforatum extract.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate specific pregnancy and labour and delivery events that may increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). A matched case-control study was conducted in five counties in southern California, using California death certificate records. The sample consisted of 239 Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic and Asian mothers of SIDS infants and 239 mothers of control infants matched on sex, race, birth hospital and date of birth. Mothers participated in a detailed telephone interview and provided access to obstetric and paediatric records. More case than control mothers reported a family history of anaemia (OR = 2.12, P < 0.001). Placental abruptions were strongly associated with SIDS (unadjusted OR = 7.94, [95% CI 1.34,47.12]). There was an increased risk of SIDS death associated with maternal anaemia during pregnancy (OR = 2.51, [95% CI 1.25,5.03]), while simultaneously adjusting for maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal years of education and age, parity, infant birthweight, gestational age, medical conditions at birth, infant sleep position and post-natal smoking. Interactions of anaemia and prenatal smoking as well as anaemia and post-natal smoking were not statistically significant. There were no other statistically significant differences between case and control mothers for pregnancy conditions, labour and delivery events (e.g. caesarean sections, anaesthesia, forceps) or newborn complications (e.g. nuchal cord, meconium aspiration). Anaemia and placental abruptions were significantly associated with an increased risk of SIDS; both are circumstances in which a fetus may become hypoxic, thereby compromising the subsequent growth, development and ultimate survival of the infant.

N2  - Behavioral and neurochemical effects of perinatal alcohol exposure (3% v/v solution from Day 15 of gestation to Day 7 after parturition) have been investigated in Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) and alcohol-nonpreferring (sNP) rat lines, selectively bred for opposite alcohol preference and consumption. In an elevated zero-maze model of anxiety, sucrose-exposed sP rats (sP-S): (i) spent significantly less time on the open arms (TO); (ii) exhibited a significantly lower number of head dips (HDIPS); and (iii) showed a higher number of stretched attend-postures (SAP) than sucrose-exposed sNP rats (sNP-S) at 90 and 180 days of age. The two rat lines displayed different emotional reactivity in response to alcohol exposure. Subtle differences in sexual behavior and ultrasonic emission (latency to the first intromission and to the first 50 kHz call) were observed between sP-S and sNP-S rats. sP-alcohol exposed (sP-A) offspring exhibited a higher latency to the first intromission than sNP-alcohol (sNP-A) treated rats. Moreover, a lower number of sP-A rats exhibited both intromission and ejaculation with respect to sNP-A animals. sP-S rats were significantly slower in recover of the righting reflex than sNP-S animals after a challenge dose of alcohol (3 g/kg, i.p.). Perinatal alcohol did not affect either onset or duration of sleep time in either line. Neurochemical experiments have shown that perinatal alcohol did not influence basal dopamine levels or amphetamine-induced dopamine increase in the prefrontal cortex of either sP or sNP offspring. These results, showing an endpoint-specific differential sensitivity of sP and sNP lines to perinatal low alcohol exposure, indicate that genetic factors could be responsible for selective susceptibility to behavioral alterations induced by developmental treatment with this drug of abuse. © 2002 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

N2  - The objective of this study was to determine if maternal sleeping position around the time of implantation influences eventual placental implantation site. Between November 1997 and April 1999, women with singleton pregnancies between gestational ages of 15 and 20 weeks presenting for ultrasound examinations were prospectively queried regarding their usual position of sleep during early gestation. Dominant position of sleep was noted as prone, supine, right side, or left side. At ultrasound examination, placental location was categorized as (1) fundal, (2) left high, (3) right high, (4) anterior high, (5) posterior high, (6) anterior low, (7) posterior low, (8) right low, (9) left low, or (10) central low. During the 18 months of this study, data were obtained from 1,500 patients. At the time of conception, front or prone sleeping was the most common (497 of 1,500, 33.1%), followed by right side (439 of 1,500, 29.3%) and left side (360 of 1,500, 24%), with the back being the least frequent position of sleep (204 of 1,500, 13.6%). Women who usually slept supine at the time of conception and implantation were significantly more likely to have a high or fundal placental location compared with those who usually slept in the prone position (p = 0.041). In addition, women who slept exclusively on their right side early in pregnancy were significantly more likely to have a right-sided placental location compared with women who slept exclusively on their left side (p = 0.025). The data from this investigation indicate that sleeping position early in gestation may influence the ultimate placental implantation site.

N2  - During gestation, the perinatal neuroendocrine axis keeps clock time. In primates, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (biological clock in mammals), shows oscillatory function by midgestation. There is evidence in rodents that the mother, during pregnancy, entrains the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and newborn circadian rhythms. We are investigating the role of maternal melatonin as an entraining signal for the newborn circadian time-keeping system in the Cebus apella (New World non-human primate). Twenty-four hour rhythms of temperature and cortisol are present in the 4 days old C. apella newborn. Preliminary data suggests that inhibition of maternal melatonin by exposing pregnant females to constant light alters these rhythms. We have found binding sites for melatonin and expression of mRNA for Mel 1A receptor in hypothalamus, kidney and testis. These preliminary results suggest that maternal melatonin may play a role in relating the perinatal circadian time-keeping system to environmental signals. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

N2  - The circadian time-keeping system is the neural system that allows predictive adaptation of individuals to the reproducible 24-hour day/night alternations of our planet. A biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, receives environmental information and imposes a circadian pattern to physiological functions. Since the suprachiasmatic nucleus develops early in gestation and circadian rhythms are present in the fetus and newborn, the circadian system seems to be functional in fetal life and can receive circadian inputs through the mother. The neonate moves to an environment in which the main time giving signal is the light:dark cycle. Teleologically, a term newborn should be fit to face this challenge. But this may be quite different for a preterm infant that trades the circadian environment to which it was previously exposed for the timeless environment of the Neonatal Intensive Care Nursery. Scientists and physicians should seek new experimental and clinical approaches to answer the challenging questions of perinatal chronomedicine. Copyright © 2001 by W.B. Saunders Company.

N2  - Prenatal stress in rats can exert profound influence on the offspring's development, inducing abnormalities such as increased "anxiety", "emotionality" or "depression-like" behaviours. Prenatal stress has long-term effects on the development of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and forebrain cholinergic systems. These long-term neuroendocrinological effects are mediated, at least in part, by stress-induced maternal corticosterone increase during pregnancy and stress-induced maternal anxiety during the postnatal period. We have shown a significant phase advance in the circadian rhythms of corticosterone secretion and locomotor activity in prenatally-stressed (PNS) rats. When subjected to an abrupt shift in the light-dark (LD) cycle, PNS rats resynchronized their activity rhythm more slowly than control rats. In view of the data suggesting abnormalities in the circadian timing system in these animals, we have investigated the effects of prenatal stress on the sleep-wake cycle in adult male rats. PNS rats exhibited various changes in sleep-wake parameters, including a dramatic increase in the amount of paradoxical sleep. Taken together, our results indicate that prenatal stress can induce increased responses to stress and abnormal circadian rhythms and sleep in adult rats. Various clinical observations in humans suggest a possible pathophysiological link between depression and disturbances in circadian rhythmicity. Circadian abnormalities in depression can be related to those found in PNS rats. Interestingly, we have recently shown that the increased immobility in the forced swimming test observed in PNS rats can be corrected by chronic treatment with the antidepressant tianeptine, or with melatonin or S23478, a melatonin agonist. Those results reinforce the idea of the usefulness of PNS rats as an appropriate animal model to study human depression and support a new antidepressant-like effect of melatonin and the melatonin agonist S23478.

N2  - Study objectives: This study was designed to evaluate sleep-related disordered breathing in obese women during pregnancy. Obesity is known to predispose to sleep-related breathing disorders. During pregnancy, obese mothers gain additional weight, but other mechanisms may counteract this effect. Design: A case-control study to compare sleep-related breathing in obese pregnant women (mean prepregnancy body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m2) with pregnant women of normal weight (mean BMI, 20 to 25 kg/m2). Setting: University teaching hospital with a sleep laboratory. Participants: We recruited II obese women (BMI, 34 kg/m2; mean age 31 years) and II control women (BMI, 23 kg/m2; mean age 32 years). Interventions: Overnight polysomnography was performed during early (after 12 weeks) and late (after 30 weeks) pregnancy. Measurements and results: During pregnancy, obese mothers gained 13 kg and control women gained 16 kg. Sleep characteristics did not differ between the groups. During late pregnancy, the women in both groups slept more poorly and slept in supine position less. During early pregnancy, their apnea-hypopnea indexes (1.7 events per hour vs 0.2 events per hour; p < 0.05), 4% oxygen desaturations (5.3 events per hour vs 0.3 events per hour; p < 0.005), and snoring times (32% vs 1%, p < 0.001) differed significantly. These differences between the groups persisted in the second polysomnography, with snoring time further increasing in the obese. Preeclampsia and mild obstructive sleep apnea were diagnosed in one obese mother. One obese mother delivered a baby showing growth retardation (weight - 3 SD). Conclusions: We have shown significantly more sleep-related disordered breathing occurring in obese mothers than in subjects of normal weight, despite similar sleeping characteristics.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Arterial blood pressure (BP) shows circadian variation. The most important feature of the circadian variation of BP is it fall during sleep. Nocturnal fall of BP achieves at least 10% ("dip"). Very scanty literature is available on the diurnal BP pattern in healthy gravidae with uncomplicated pregnancy. DESIGN: The aim of the study was to evaluate of the day-time/night-time mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) fall in pregnant woman in the first half of pregnancy in comparison with healthy non-pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty seven healthy woman were included into the study, and divided into two groups: 23 pregnant woman in 7-20 weeks of first gestation and 34 non-pregnant woman. All the subjects were included into the 24-hours non-invasive automated blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Nocturnal fall of BP appeared to be the most pronounced element of the circadian BP pattern in the studied women. Women in the first half of pregnancy exhibit reduction of BP in the night-time similar to that observed in the non-pregnant subjects. In average, 2/3 of pregnant women below 20 weeks of gestation belong to "dippers" in the MAP range. Women with higher mean diurnal BP value have less pronounced nocturnal BP "dip".

N2  - Objective: To assess the level of recognition and knowledge about treatment of depression by General Practitioners (GPs). Method: Analysis of questionnaires completed by participants commencing a series of workshops aimed at improving their knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of depression. Of the 3289 GPs involved in the program 2500 (76% respondent rate) completed the questionnaires in a group situation. There was no difference between respondents and nonrespondents in terms of age, gender and year of graduation. Results: The majority of GPs believe they have a satisfactory competence in the recognition and treatment of depression, although a sizeable minority based their diagnosis predominantly on somatic symptoms. The GPs felt confident about their knowledge and skills in counselling and the use of antidepressant medication, but not in dealing with children and suicidal or pregnant patients. The most common symptoms used to identify 'depression' were sleep disorders and only 54% listed depressed mood as a symptom on which the diagnosis is based. Only 28% reported sufficient symptoms to meet criteria for DSM-IV major depressive disorder, which supports views that these criteria are inappropriate for general practice. Fifty-seven percent of doctors used medicine together with nonpharmacological treatment in the majority of patients, and medications doses were almost all within the range recommended in the product information. Conclusions: There is a need to improve GPs knowledge in diagnosing depression, in child psychiatry and in dealing with pregnant and suicidal patients.

N2  - Although pregnant women are discouraged from drinking alcohol because of alcohol's detrimental effect on fetal development, the lore of many cultures encourages lactating women to drink alcohol to optimize breast milk production and infant nutrition. In contrast to this folklore, however, studies demonstrate that maternal alcohol consumption may slightly reduce milk production. Furthermore, some of the alcohol consumed by a lactating woman is transferred to her milk and thus consumed by the infant. This alcohol consumption may adversely affect the infant's sleep and gross motor development and influence early learning about alcohol. Based on this science, it would seem that the recommendation for a nursing mother to drink a glass of beer or wine shortly before nursing may actually be counterproductive.

N2  - Besides their binding to cognate intracellular receptors gonadal steroids may also act as functional antagonists at the 5-HT3 receptor. A structure-activity relationship for the actions of a variety of steroids at the 5-HT3 receptor was elaborated that differed considerably from that known for GABAA receptors. Steroids appear to interact allosterically with ligand-gated ion channels at the receptor membrane interface. The functional antagonism of gonadal steroids at the 5-HT3 receptor may play a role for the development and course of nausea during pregnancy and of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, we could demonstrate that 3α-reduced neuroactive steroids concurrently modulate the GABAA receptor and regulate gene expression via the progesterone receptor after intracellular oxidation. Animal studies showed that progesterone is converted rapidly into GABAergic neuroactive steroids in vivo. Progesterone reduces locomotor activity in a dose dependent fashion in male Wister rats. Moreover, progesterone and 3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone produce a benzodiazepine-like sleep EEG profile in rats and humans. In addition, there is a dysequilibrium of such 3α-reduced neuroactive steroids during major depression which is corrected by successful treatment with antidepressants. Neuroactive steroids may further be involved in the treatment of depression and anxiety with antidepressants in patients during ethanol withdrawal. First studies in patients with panic disorder suggest that neuroactive steroids may also play a pivotal role in human anxiety. The genomic and non-genomic effects of steroids in the brain contribute to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and the mechanisms of action of antidepressants. Neuroactive steroids affect a broad spectrum of behavioral functions through their unique molecular properties and may constitute a yet unexploited class of drugs. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the range and frequency of behaviors in neonates 24-30 weeks postconceptional age (PCA) using the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care Assessment Program (NIDCAP). DESIGN: A prospective design with convenience sampling was used. SAMPLE: Starting 24-72 hours postnatally and continuing through 30 weeks PCA, 8,144 two-minute observations of 85 NIDCAP behaviors were collected and analyzed from 42 neonates born at 24-29 weeks gestation. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The main outcome variables were the frequencies of the 85 neonatal behaviors measured by the NIDCAP. Frequencies were organized first by subsystem (autonomic, motor, or state) and were categorized further based on week of PCA. Comparisons of behavioral frequencies by number of weeks PCA were completed using correlation and regression analyses. RESULTS: The most frequently observed behaviors were irregular respirations, pink color, postured flexion of the extremities, immature light sleep, and drowsiness. Least frequently observed behaviors consisted of burps, bowel movement, grunting, smooth motor movements, cooing, and speech movement. Regression analysis illustrated that the pattern of behavior was significantly similar week to week.

N2  - Self-reported snoring is common in pregnancy, particularly in females with pre-eclampsia. The prevalence of inspiratory flow limitation during sleep in pre-eclamptic females was objectively assessed and compared with normal pregnant and nonpregnant females. Fifteen females with pre-eclampsia were compared to 15 females from each of the three trimesters of pregnancy, as well as to 15 matched nonpregnant control females (total study population, 75 subjects). All subjects had overnight monitoring of respiration, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure (BP). No group had evidence of a clinically significant sleep apnoea syndrome, but patients with pre-eclampsia spent substantially more time (31±8.4% of sleep period time, mean±SD) with evidence of inspiratory flow limitation compared to 15.5±2.3% in third trimester subjects and <5% in the other three groups (p=0.001). In the majority of pre-eclamptics, the pattern of flow limitation was of prolonged episodes lasting several minutes without associated oxygen desaturation. As expected, systolic and diastolic BPs were significantly higher in the pre-eclamptic group (p<0.001), but all groups showed a significant fall (p≤0.05) in BP during sleep. Inspiratory flow limitation is common during sleep in patients with pre-eclampsia, which may have implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of this disorder.

N2  - Clinical depression is diagnosed in 5-15% of women during pregnancy, increasing the risk of negative outcomes. Fluoxetine (FX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is prescribed during pregnancy. In adults, FX alters sleep patterns with single doses decreasing total sleep time and rapid eye movement sleep. The effects of FX on sleep in the fetus are unknown. However, 5-hydroxytryptophan, the precursor of serotonin, has been reported to prolong high-voltage (HV) electrocortical (ECoG) activity and increase the incidence of fetal breathing movements (FBM) in the sheep fetus. We hypothesize that FX exposure will decrease the incidence of LV ECoG in the fetus. Twenty-one pregnant sheep were surgically prepared for chronic study of blood gases, ECoG activity, eye movements and FBM. After 3 days of recovery, ewes received a 70-mg bolus i.v. infusion of FX or sterile water followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.036 mg/min for 8 days. The incidence of low-voltage (LV) ECoG decreased from 54±4% on the preinfusion day to 45±5% on infusion day 1 in the FX group and remained decreased throughout the infusion period. In addition, the incidence of both eye movements and FBM was decreased on infusion day 1 compared to preinfusion day in the FX group. HV ECoG increased from 39±3% on preinfusion day to 68±14% on FX infusion day 1 and remained elevated throughout the infusion period. These data show that maternal FX administration alters fetal behavioural state. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives: To describe beliefs about infant sleep position among African American grandmothers and other older caregivers (senior caregivers [SCGs]) and to measure the incremental effect on the rates of prone sleep after educating a group of African American SCGs. Design: Survey of sleep practices and beliefs. Randomized, controlled trial of a teaching intervention. Settings Managed care prenatal clinic for normal risk obstetrics patients. Participants: Low-income pregnant women, self-identified as African American. An SCG is an older family member or friend to whom they would go for advice about routine child care. Pregnant women randomly assigned to the control group (educated about safe sleep practices) or the experimental group (education for both pregnant women and their SCG). Intervention: During the third trimester, 2 teaching sessions for pregnant women (both control and experimental groups) and for the experimental group's SCGs. One-on-one teaching emphasizing that infants should sleep supine. Main Outcome Measures: During the third trimester, description of rate of preference for prone sleep for infants among pregnant women and SCGs. Effects of teaching SCGs on (1) SCGs' postnatal beliefs about sleep position as a means to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, and (2) the eventual rate of prone sleeping among study infants. Results: One hundred twenty-five women were in the control group; 98 pregnant women and SCG pairs were in the experimental group. Senior caregivers were 47.1 ± 12.4 years old (mean ± SD). Most were grandmothers (either maternal, 72.5%, or paternal, 14.3%) or aunts or sisters (10.2%). No differences were noted in the prenatal rates of the prone preference (controls, 36.3%; experimental group, 35.7%; and SCGs, 34.7%). Teaching SCGs did not increase the rate of the usual prone sleep in the experimental vs the control group (13.3% vs 17.3%, X2 = 0.59, P =.44, 95% confidence interval for difference from -5.8% to + 13.8%). After the teaching and during the pregnancy, the SCGs became less worried that the infant was susceptible to sudden infant death syndrome (X2 = 16.6, P = .003) or likely to die of sudden infant death syndrome (X2 = 24.7, P < .001). Their concerns about sudden infant death syndrome were significantly less postnatally, in particular when the infant was placed supine (X2 = 19.4, P < .001). Conclusions: Most African American women and SCGs endorsed the supine sleeping position for infants. Among a group of African American infants, prenatal teaching of their grandmothers and other SCGs did not have a statistically significant incremental effect on the rates of the usual prone sleeping position. Contrary to our starting hypothesis, the SCGs of pregnant women who receive prenatal care seemed responsive to messages about supine sleeping. The Back-to-Sleep message should be delivered prenatally, but special prenatal interventions should attempt to reach women who do not receive prenatal care and SCGs who persist in their opposition to the supine sleeping position.

N2  - Preeclampsia is the most common disease of pregnancy, occurring in up to 10% of the pregnant population. The cause of the disease is as yet undetermined; however, most of the clinical effects are commonly attributed to damage to the endothelial layer, leading to increased pressor activity of all the maternal blood vessels. Therefore, we suspected that if obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) coexisted with preeclampsia in pregnancy, the hemodynamic effects of the OSA would be markedly potentiated. To test this hypothesis, we performed full sleep studies and overnight beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) monitoring. The control patient group included 10 pregnant women with OSA and no evidence of hypertensive disease either before or during their current pregnancy. The test group included 10 women with preeclampsia and coexisting OSA, The pressor responses to obstructive respiratory events during sleep were enhanced in preeclamptic patients compared with control OSA patients (21 ± 2/12 ± 1 mm Hg and 38 ± 5/25 ± 4 mm Hg above baseline in control OSA and preeclamptic OSA patients, respectively, P = .005/.005). In contrast, there was no difference in heart rate responses between the two groups of subjects (34 ± 5 beats/min and 49 ± 13 beats/rain above baseline in control and preeclamptic patient groups, respectively, P = .326). We suggest that the augmented pressor responses in preeclamptic women occur as a result of maternal endothelial damage induced by the preeclampsia disease process. These findings may have important implications in the management of preeclamptic patients. © 2001 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

N2  - Retrospective studies in humans suggest that chronic maternal stress during pregnancy, associated with raised plasma levels of CRH, ACTH and cortisol may increase the likelihood of preterm birth, developmental delays and behavioural abnormalities in the children. In adulthood, it may contribute to the significant association between the incidence of schizophrenia, increased left or mixed handedness, reduction in cerebral asymmetry and anomalies in brain morphology. Our studies and others have shown that prenatal stress in rats can mimic these developmental and behavioural alterations. These rats show a reduced propensity for social interaction, increased anxiety in intimidating or novel situations and a reduction in cerebral asymmetry and dopamine turnover, consistent with those in schizophrenic humans. Prenatally-stressed (PS) rats also show behaviour consistent with depression, including a phase-shift in their circadian rhythm for corticosterone, sleep abnormalities, a hedonic deficit and greater acquisition of learned helplessness under appropriate conditions. These behavioural abnormalities are associated with impaired regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to stress and increased CRH activity. PS males may show demasculinisation and feminisation of their sexual behaviour. The developmental and behavioural abnormalities in PS offspring could occur through sensitisation of the foetal brain by maternal stress hormones to the action of glucocorticoid and CRH and to neurotransmitters affected by them. This may have long-lasting consequences and could explain the precipitation of depressive symptoms or schizophrenia by psychosocial stress in later life. The character of the behavioural abnormalities probably depends on the timing of the maternal stress in relation to development of the particular neuronal systems. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

N2  - Women have twice the incidence of major depression compared with men. They are prone to develop episodes of depression during times of reproductive hormonal change at puberty, with use of oral contraceptives, during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, postpartum and during the perimenopause (see review: Parry 1995a). Wirz-Justice (1995) describes the variety of disturbances in biological rhythms observed in mood disorders. In this report, we describe the chronobiological disturbances observed in female-specific mood disorders, namely, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, pregnancy and postpartum depression and menopause. We hypothesize that changing reproductive hormones, by affecting the synchrony or coherence between components of the circadian system, may alter amplitude or phase (timing) relationships and thereby contribute to the development of mood disorders in predisposed individuals. © 2001 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

N2  - Objectives: To assess awareness of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and risk reducing recommendations in a sample of mothers in North Queensland, Australia, and to examine their infant care practices. Method: Interviews conducted with 195 women using a standardized questionnaire between October 1997 and January 1998. Results: 191 questionnaires analyzed; 134 (70.2%) Caucasian and 57 (29.8%) indigenous women. Four women with previous SIDS experience were excluded from the analysis. Eight (4.2%) had never heard of SIDS. Twenty-nine (15.2%) had heard of SIDS and 154 (80.6%) had heard of SIDS and could list risk recommendations to reduce its incidence. Multivariate analysis identified ethnicity as the only significant predictor of maternal knowledge. Indigenous mothers knew less about SIDS: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 5.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) = [2.1-14.0]. Avoidance of prone sleeping was the most frequently identified recommendation (n = 132), with no smoking in pregnancy (n = 48) and breastfeeding (n = 40) identified least frequently. There were 80.2% of mothers who put their infant in non-prone positions to sleep. Only 48 (25%) women identified smoking in pregnancy, and 93 (48.6%) smoking in the infant's environment as risk factors. Indigenous women were more likely to smoke in their pregnancy (P = 0.004), bed share with their infant (P = 0.0001), and have smokers in the home. Conclusion: There is a high level of awareness of SIDS and the main associated risk factor of infant prone sleeping, but the link between SIDS and smoking requires further emphasis. Future campaigns should ensure the SIDS message is delivered more effectively to the indigenous communities.

N2  - ERG recordings from German cockroaches showed that the amplitude of light-evoked responses have a circadian rhythmicity in adult males that coincided with the locomotor circadian rhythm. The peak of the response occurred during the subjective night, and the circadian period was less than 24 h under DD condition. In contrast, although the locomotor circadian rhythm was masked by the development of ovaries and pregnancy in females, their visual responses displayed circadian rhythmicity. This inconsistency in expression of locomotor and visual sensitivity circadian rhythms in females implied separate pacemakers for these two overt rhythms. After severing the optic nerves, changes in ERG amplitude of the operated cockroaches still displayed a circadian rhythm under DD condition, demonstrating that the visual sensitive pacemaker was located in the eye and independent from the locomotor pacemaker.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurosensory disorder that typically begins in the evening and often prevents a person from falling asleep. It has been associated with iron deficiency anemia and dopaminergic pathways and is often treated with iron infusion or dopamine agonists. The purpose of this secondary analysis of longitudinal data collected on women before, during, and after pregnancy is to document the prevalence of RLS during pregnancy, contrast its effect on sleep and mood state, and explore the role of folate and iron in the expression of RLS, specifically during the third trimester when the syndrome is most distressing. The prevalence increased from 0 during preconception to 23% (n = 7) during the third trimester of pregnancy. Only 1 subject continued to experience RLS after delivery. Compared with those without complaints of restless legs, those with restless legs had low serum ferritin at preconception and significantly lower folate levels during preconception and at each trimester. In addition, time to sleep onset was significantly delayed and depressed mood was significantly higher in the RLS group. Rather than indicators of iron deficiency anemia (serum ferritin, serum iron, and hemoglobin) or pernicious anemia (vitamin B12), it was reduced serum folate level that was associated with RLS in this sample of pregnant women. Findings indicate a need to reconsider recommendations about the normal ranges of serum ferritin and serum folate levels during pregnancy to minimize the complaints of restless legs and promote more consolidated sleep and better daytime mood state during pregnancy.

N2  - Circadian rhythms of mammals are generated endogenously, the master oscillator system residing in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Previous experiments have indicated that the rabbit has a feeding entrainable circadian oscillator (FEO) which is supposed to be of greatest importance during the early infancy of the rabbit. Here we report the course of telemetrically monitored core body temperature of rabbit pups and of their does. Temperature increased from 37.6±0.3°C on day 2 to 39.5±0.1°C on day 28 of life. The pups showed a 24 h temperature rhythm even during their first days of life. Temperature increased 21/2-3 h prior to nursing for 0.4-0.8°C and rose for an additional 0.4-0.6°C immediately after milk ingestion. The anticipatory, but not the postprandial component persisted when nursing was skipped twice. The persistence of a rhythm in the absence of any entraining agent is crucial for its endogenous generation. In the doe, the core body temperature gradually decreased during the last 2/3 of pregnancy. During parturition it steeply rose for 1.5-1.7°C and attained a plateau of 39.7±0.2°C during lactation. The circadian rhythm persisted during the whole course of pregnancy and lactation. Thus, in the rabbit an endogenous, feeding entrainable circadian oscillator appears to operate from the first days of life. It is of functional significance in that it alerts the pup in time so that it is able to utilize the singular short presence of the doe for maximal milk intake.

N2  - During the first weeks of life, preterm neonates show fewer circadian rhythms in their physiological parameters than full-term neonates. To determine whether preterm neonates differ in their temporal adaptation to the day-night cycle from full-term neonates at the early age of 1 week, we compared activity-rest behavior of both groups. Activity-rest behavior of 10 neurologically healthy preterm neonates (born in 34th to 36th week of gestation) and 10 neurologically healthy full-term neonates (born in 37th to 42nd week of gestation) was monitored longitudinally for 8 successive days in the first 2 weeks of life. Actigraphy was used to register and display time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using small actometers, which resemble a wristwatch. Nursing/feeding was recorded using the actometer's integrated event marker button. Recordings for preterm neonates were conducted in the hospital; recordings for full-term neonates were carried out in the hospital and in their homes. In addition to the actigraphic recordings, a standardized diary was kept regularly. To assess periodic characteristics, frequency components of activity-rest behavior were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation (FFT). Amounts of daily sleep time, nightly sleep time, and sleep time during 24h were compared. Nursing/feeding epochs were also analyzed for 5 preterm and 5 full-term neonates to compare their food intake behavior. The majority of preterm neonates showed a multitude of ultradian frequencies in their spectra. In contrast, several full-term neonates showed a distinct circadian frequency. In preterm neonates, average nightly sleep and average daily sleep of all recorded days were very similar, but after the fourth day of life, only average nightly sleep increased. In full-term neonates, average nightly and daily sleep time of all recorded days differed by about 1h. Average sleep time during 24h for preterm and full-term neonates was similar. Preterm neonates showed longer intervals between events of food intake than full-term neonates. The circadian peaks in the frequency spectra of full-term neonates may indicate the initial adaptation in the first week of life to a 24h day. This is in agreement with our results concerning the different durations of nightly and daily sleep. The increase in nightly sleep time of preterm neonates may be attributed to the progressing adaptation to a circadian activity-rest pattern.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive ability of parameters of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension in women who are already considered at risk for these disorders. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twenty-two pregnant women who were considered high risk for the development of preeclampsia underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring between 18 and 30 weeks gestation, while their condition was normotensive according to routine mercury sphygmomanometry. One hundred sixty-four healthy primigravid women who were considered at usual risk for preeclampsia underwent the same tests as a parallel study. Routine blood pressure, awake and sleep average blood pressure, and 24-hour mean average blood pressure were entered into multiple logistic regression as predictors of either preeclampsia or gestational hypertension; significant variables were then tested by a series of receiver operator curves. RESULTS: Eight percent of usual risk and 45% of high risk women experienced the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In both groups, the average routine mercury blood pressure and awake, sleeping, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring-derived blood pressure were significantly higher in women who later experienced the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In usual risk women, 24-hour systolic blood pressure of ≥115 mm Hg and sleeping systolic blood pressure of ≥106 mm Hg were predictive of later preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, but sensitivities were low (77% and 54%, respectively). In high risk women, sleeping diastolic blood pressure of ≥62 mm Hg and sleeping mean arterial pressure of ≥79 mm Hg were predictive of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, but again sensitivities were low (70% and 65%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Awake and sleeping blood pressure are higher in midpregnancy in women who later experience the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides a noninvasive method of selecting some of these women, but this test has a sensitivity no better than that of other predictive tests, even in women at high risk for preeclampsia.

N2  - Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) occurs in 30-50% of all pregnancies. The progressive rise in plasma progesterone has been suggested as a possible mediator of GER during pregnancy. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to detect GER through monitoring of esophageal pH for prolonged periods, including sleep. 24-hour pH monitoring is the proper method for diagnosing GER in pregnant women. If 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring is to be a useful diagnostic tool, it must reliably discriminate GER patients despite daily variations in distal esophageal acid exposure. To address this issue, we studied 62 women (30 healthy non-pregnant women without GER symptoms and 32 pregnant women with GER symptoms-heartburn, acid regurgitation) with 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring. Intrasubject reproducibility of three pH parameters to discriminate the presence of abnormal acid reflux was determined (DeMeester score, Kaye score, circadian one hour diagram for pH < 4). Each patient was interviewed, using a reliable questionnaire detailing individual habits, life style characteristics and symptoms, at four time points during the first, second, third trimesters of pregnancy and post-partum period. Symptoms of GER are common in pregnancy and although GER rarely endangers maternal or fetal health, it can significantly affect patient comfort and quality of life. We conclude: 1. GER is almost constantly present during pregnancy, increasing with gestational age. 2. The most important pH--parameter is DeMcester score. 3. Heartburn disappear after delivery. 4. 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring is the gold standard for measuring acid exposure and is a reproducible test for the diagnosis of GER in pregnancy.

N2  - This quasi-experimental research investigates developmental regulation around a critical life-span transition, the "biological clock" for childbearing. The action-phase model of developmental regulation proposes contrasting control orientations in individuals approaching versus those having passed a developmental deadline. Individuals in an urgency phase close to the deadline should be invested in goal pursuit, whereas those who have passed the deadline without attaining the goal should focus on goal disengagement and self-protection. In 2 studies, women at different ages and with or without children were compared with regard to various indicators of primary and secondary control striving for goal attainment versus goal disengagement and self-protection. Findings support the action-phase model of developmental regulation. Patterns of control striving congruent with the participants' status as preversus postdeadline were associated with superior psychological well-being.

N2  - Objective: Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) increases are reported during normal pregnancy, but the relation to arterial pressure and the renin-angiotensin system is debatable. We assessed whether normotensive pregnancies with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) present an alteration of maternal ANP levels. Design: A total of 11 pregnant women with IUGR, in the absence of any other maternal or fetal pathology, entered the study during the third trimester. They were compared with 12 healthy pregnant women of similar age and characteristics. We monitored all subjects for blood pressure (BP), ANP, aldosterone and plasma renin activity (PRA), under the same conditions for 24 h. All subjects were submitted to the same regimen of life; with homogenous dark:light periods, salt intake and meal times. Methods: BP was monitored at 20 min intervals for 24 hand blood tests performed at six time points during the 24 h. EDTA plasma samples were immediately centrifuged. Hormone assays were performed by radioimmunoassay. Koch's nonparametric two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the hormone time-dependent profiles in the two groups. Circadian rhythms were assessed by cosinor analysis. Results: The IUGR group was characterized by higher ANP values compared to normal pregnancy, (205 ± 24 versus 146 ± 21 pg/ml: P < 0.05) but not significant differences were shown for PRA, aldosterone and BP circadian rhythms. Conclusions: This study shows higher ANP values in human pregnancy complicated by IUGR, with presence of normal BP, aldosterone and PRA profiles. © 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Objective To determine (a) the prevalence of hypertension during sleep in pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, and (b) whether women with hypertension during sleep have worse pregnancy outcomes than hypertensive pregnant women with controlled (normal) blood pressure (BP) during sleep. Design Prospective double-blind cohort study. Setting Inpatients and outpatients managed in a day assessment unit (DAU) at St George Hospital, Sydney, Australia. Participants A total of 186 hypertensive pregnant women, 158 of whom had successful 24 h BP monitoring; 40% had proteinuric pre-eclampsia (PE), 43% gestational hypertension (GH) and 17% essential hypertension (EH). Interventions Blood pressure, 24 h non-invasive, monitoring (Spacelabs 90207) was undertaken successfully in 158 women with PE, GH or EH, whether or not they were receiving antihypertensives. Women and clinicians were blinded to results of these BP monitors. Sleep hypertension was defined as BP > 117/68 mmHg at 26-30 weeks or < 123/72 mmHg after 30 weeks gestation. Main outcome measures Maternal and fetal outcomes were compared between women with and without sleep hypertension and the prevalence of sleep hypertension was determined. Results Sleep hypertension was present in 59%, more commonly in PE (79%) than GH/EH (45%), P<0.0001. Sleep hypertensives also had higher routine sphygmomanometer BPs [137(10)/91(7) mmHg; mean(SD)] than women with normal sleep BP [130(12)/87(8) mmHg] P = 0.007, and higher awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) BPs [137(8)/88(7) versus 127(7)/79(6) mmHg], P<0.0001. Awake, but not sleep, average heart rate was lower in sleep hypertensives [85(11) versus 91(10) beats per minute, bpm], P = 0.002. Sleep hypertensives had a significantly greater frequency of renal insufficiency, liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia and episodes of (awake) severe hypertension (P<0.05), as well as lower birth weight babies [2715(808) versus 3224(598) g, P<0.0001]. Conclusions Hypertension during sleep is a common finding in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly pre-eclampsia. These women also have higher awake BPs and a greater frequency of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. These findings are largely explained by the greater likelihood of pre-eclamptics having sleep hypertension. © 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - To monitor infant care practices associated with risks for sudden infant death, 400 Belgian families with infants less than 6 months old were questioned by 21 paediatricians during routine visits to local paediatric practices and well baby services (11 in urban centres, 10 in rural areas). Because of incomplete information, 35 families were excluded. Of the 365 mothers included in the study, 36.1% had under 7 years of schooling, 38.4% less than 13 years, and 25.5% had a professional school or a university degree. Risk factors for sudden infant death were found in 208 (56.9%) families: a usual non-supine sleep position (31.5% of the infants); sleeping under a duvet (24.1%); mothers smoking during and after gestation (16.4%); a high room temperature (6.6%); use of sedatives (3.8%); necklaces or plastic film in the cot (2.5%); and soft beddings (2.2%). Maternal education, but not the fathers' profession was significantly related to the number of risk factors (mean odds ratio of 4.4; 95% CI: 1.5 to 5.3; P = 0.001). A stepwise logistic regression analysis identified the mother's length of schooling as the single most significant independent factor for the presence of risk (P < 0.005). Conclusion: Less educated mothers report having been informed of risk-educating recommendations as frequently as better educated mothers. It can be concluded that future reduction in risks for sudden infant death syndrome should include new strategies designed to modify infant care pratices.

N2  - Objective. To investigate the acceptability of an ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitor (SpaceLabs 90207) and a self-initiated blood pressure monitor (Omron HEM-705CP) to pregnant women. Methods. Acceptability of the SpaceLabs 90207 and Omron HEM-705CP monitors was evaluated, using a modified British Hypertension Device assessment form, by (1) healthy, pregnant women at <15 weeks (n = 120), 35-37 weeks (n = 81), and 5-9 weeks postpartum (n = 86); and (2) women with preeclampsia (n = 52). Main Outcome Measures. A monitor was acceptable if a woman graded the overall impression as "good" or "very good." Results. Healthy women at <15 and 35-37 weeks' gestation and preeclamptic women reported the SpaceLabs 90207 monitor caused discomfort in 54%, 52%, and 60%, interfered with activities in 38%, 40%, and 23%, and disturbed sleep in 62%, 52% and 31%, respectively. Fewer than 12% in any group reported these problems with the Omron HEM-705CP monitor. In the 78 women who evaluated both monitors at 35-37 weeks, the SpaceLabs 90207 and Omron HEM-705CP were acceptable to 78% and 95% of healthy women, respectively (p = 0.005). Women with preeclampsia rated the Space-Labs 90207 as "bad" or "fair" (14%), "good" (58%), and "very good" (28%) compared with "bad" or "fair" (8%), "good" (28%), and "very good" (64%) for the Omron HEM-705CP monitor (p= 0.009). Conclusions. Pregnant women found the less intensive blood pressure monitoring with the Omron HEM-705CP more acceptable than the 24-h ABP monitoring with the SpaceLabs 90207. If accurate self-initiate blood pressure devices become available, pregnant women would prefer this method of home blood pressure monitoring.

N2  - Children frequently received no treatment, or inadequate treatment, for pain and for painful procedures. The newborn and critically ill children are especially vulnerable to no treatment or under-treatment. Nerve pathways essential for the transmission and perception of pain are present and functioning by 24 weeks of gestation. The failure to provide analgesia for pain results in rewiring the nerve pathways responsible for pain transmission in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and results in increased pain perception for future painful results. Many children would withdraw or deny their pain in an attempt to avoid yet another terrifying and painful experiences, such as the intramuscular injections. Societal fears of opioid addiction and lack of advocacy are also causal factors in the under-treatment of pediatric pain. False beliefs about addictions and proper use of acetaminophen and other analgesics resulted in the failure to provide analgesia to children. All children even the newborn and critically ill require analgesia for pain and painful procedures. Unbelieved pain interferes with sleep, leads to fatigue and a sense of helplessness, and may result in increased morbidity or mortality.

N2  - Background: Chronic pelvic pain has often been described as a major women's health issue, but no information exists on the extent of the problem in the United Kingdom. Aim: To investigate the community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain and its effect on the lives of consulting and non-consulting women. Design of study: Postal questionnaire survey. Setting: Women aged 18 to 49 (n = 3916) randomly selected from the Oxfordshire Health Authority Register. Method: The questionnaire response rate (adjusted for non-deliveries) was 74% (2304/3106). Chronic pelvic pain was defined as recurrent or constant pelvic pain of at least six months' duration, unrelated to periods, intercourse, or pregnancy. Case subgroups comprised recent consulters, past consulters, and non-consulters. Women who reported dysmenorrhoea alone formed a comparison group. Results: The three-month prevalence of chronic pelvic pain was 24.0% (95% CI = 22.1% to 25.8%). One-third of women reported pain that started more than five years ago. Recent consulters (32% of cases) were most affected by their symptoms in terms of pain severity, use of health care, physical and mental health scores, sleep quality, and pain-related absence from work. Non-consulters (41% of cases) did not differ from women with dysmenorrhoea in terms of symptom-related impairment. Irrespective of consulting behaviour, a high rate of symptom-related anxiety was found in women with chronic pelvic pain (31%) compared with women with dysmenorrhoea (7%). Conclusions: This study showed a high community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain in women of reproductive age. Cases varied substantially in the degree to which they were affected by their symptoms. The high symptom-related anxiety in these women emphasises the need for more information about chronic pelvic pain and its possible causes.

N2  - In order to evaluate two patterns of interrupted and non-interrupted sleep for the post-partum mothers from 9 to 12 weeks after delivery, we compared them with sleep patterns of non-pregnant women. Subjects were 10 primipara and 12 non-pregnant women. Their polysomnographic recordings were made using a Medilog recorder at home. In interrupted sleep, low sleep efficiency, decreased total sleep time, and a decreased percentage of stage 2 were significantly observed compared with non-pregnant women. Sleep parameters of non-interrupted sleep, except for increased percentage of stage 4, did not show any significant differences from non-pregnant women. Mothers' sleep fluctuated between interrupted sleep similar to the early post-partum sleep from 1 to 6 weeks and non-interrupted sleep with increased stage 4.

N2  - This chapter provides a review and synthesis of research on women's sleep and fatigue from a nursing perspective. Most of the research involves four primary issues for women: menstrual cycles, childbearing, chronic mental or physical illness, and oncology. Research with healthy women focused on diurnal fluctuations in fatigue and relationships to sleep, without regard for exercise or level of daytime activity. Research on chronic illness and cancer fatigue focused on general fatigue and its impact on activity, without regard for sleep or therapeutic use of rest and naps. A comparison of these two areas highlights gaps in nursing knowledge about sleep and fatigue. Further research is needed to understand relationships between nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, and symptoms related to poor quality of life. From a synthesis of these studies, nonpharmacologic interventions that could be prove useful in promoting a higher quality of life for those with either acute or chronic fatigue are then proposed.

N2  - Rat or hamster pups exposed to constant light or darkness since birth exhibit many circadian rhythms synchronized with those of the mother. During early development, a number of cues derived from the maternal circadian system synchronize the fetal and neonatal circadian clock. Maternal pineal sympathetic denervation during early pregnancy disrupts maternal synchronization of parotid α-amylase and testicular malate dehydrogenase circadian rhythms in rat pups. Maternal pineal sympathetic denervation was used to study potential agents able to synchronize the fetal or neonatal circadian clock. Melatonin injection to denervated pregnant mothers prevents the pineal sympathetic denervation effect on those circadian rhythms. We now studied the synchronizing effect of a benzodiazepine compound, diazepam. This GABAA agonist synchronized testicular malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity of pups when it was injected to sympathetic denervated pregnant dams (a daily dose at 07:00 or 19:00h from the 14th to the 20thday of gestation) or orally administered to the pups (a daily dose at 19:00h from the 10th to 24th day of life). Co-injection of diazepam and GABAA antagonist, flumazenil, blocked the synchronizing effect of diazepam. The results demonstrate that diazepam has a synchronizing effect on the development of the circadian clock in rats and suggest that modulation of maternal GABAA could participate in mammalian maternal synchronization.

N2  - The demonstration of receptors for luteinizing hormone (LH)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in several parts of rat brain suggested their novel functional role. Subsequent studies tested the effect of hCG (intraperitoneally or intracerebroventricularly) on brain arousal and different types of stress situations in an intact female rat model on the day of proestrus. Treatment resulted in changes of activity and several other behavioral patterns associated with sites of brain hCG/LH receptors,. hCG given peripherally caused a longer sleeping time and a decreased activity level. Whereas administration of indomethacin alone had no effect, coadministration inhibited the effects of hCG. hCG increased immunoreactive prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and decreased PGE2 in brain areas controlling activity and sleep. hCG effects were probably mediated via prostaglandin pathways. After central hCG treatment, animals were less active and showed less exploratory behavior in an open-field box than the control animals. Taste and odor neophobias were dramatically decreased following central injection of hCG. hCG-treated rats were less anxious and exhibited a higher level of maternal interest than the controls. hCG treatment also had a beneficial effect against stress ulcer, which was prevented by pre-treatment with antisense receptor oligonucleotide, suggesting a direct hCG receptormediated effect. In summary, because hCG can cross the blood-brain barrier, both peripheral administration and central administration affect several behavioral patterns. This effect is similar to treatment with anxiolytics and suggests the functional relevance of brain LH/hCG receptors. Some observed behavioral changes have parallels in pregnant women.

N2  - A case of neonatal Myotonic Dystrophy (MD) is presented. A 35 week old 3570 g baby was born to a mother affected by MD and pregnancy-induced unstable diabetes. Soon after birth, he developed apnea, severe hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hypotonia and mild respiratory distress. His clinical course improved during the following days, but persistent episodes of desaturation and/or cyanosis did not subside; hypotonia was mild. A polysomnographic recording showed mixed central and obstructive apnea. DNA testing showed trinucleotide repeat expansion mutations diagnostic of MD. The baby was discharged with home-sleep monitoring and breast-feeding. Recurrent apnea/bradycardia was the main clinical feature in this case of congenital MD, with increased risk of an acute life-threatening event.

N2  - This open-label prospective study examined maternal and neonatal safety and efficacy outcome measures during and following prenatal buprenorphine exposure. Three opioid-dependent pregnant women received 8 or 12 mg sublingual buprenorphine tablets daily for 15-16 weeks prior to delivery. Results showed that buprenorphine in combination with comprehensive prenatal care was safe and effective in these women. Prenatal exposure to buprenorphine resulted in normal birth outcomes, a mean of 4.33 days (minimum possible=4) hospitalization, and a 'relatively mild' neonatal abstinence syndrome comprised primarily of tremors (disturbed), hyperactive moro and shortened sleep after feeding. The infants required no pharmacological treatment. Onset of neonatal abstinence signs occurred within the first 12 h after birth, peaked by 72 h and returned to below pre-12 h levels by 120 h. It is concluded that buprenorphine has potential utility for the treatment of pregnant opioid-dependent women. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

N2  - A 41-year-old man fell into type II respiratory failure after catching a cold, and became dependent on a respirator. Chest radiography showed no abnormalities and the hyperventilation test showed improved arterial blood gas findings. His sleep study showed marked nocturnal desaturation due to hypopnea and apnea with a decrease of thoracic and abdominal movement during sleep. Therefore, we diagnosed him as primary alveolar hypoventilation syndrome (PAH). Seven years previously, his 2-year elder sister had suffered from similar respiratory failure during her second pregnancy and had been diagnosed as PAH. While myopathy was suspected in both cases, attenuation of muscle strength was slight and it appeared not to be the main cause of alveolar hypoventilation. Since medication was not effective in each case, they underwent non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). While sustained mild hypercapnia remained during the daytime, it improved their respiratory failure. To our knowledge, this is the first study of familial adult onset PAH.

N2  - Using a visual memory test we studied memory in pregnant women. Benton's Visual Retention Test was used with 54 pregnant women three times: at term, 3-4 days post-partum, and one month after birth. There was a significant decline in visual memory at 3-4 days post-partum (p < 0.01). There was no interaction between hours of sleep and memory of pregnant women at any period. Although memory declined at 3-4 days, there was no interaction between this decline and duration of labor, intra-partum hemorrhage, or memory at one month post-partum. It is not yet clear why visual memory declined shortly after birth. Further studies on post-partum memory decline as well as the possible relationship to hormonal and mood changes are necessary.

N2  - Purpose: Routine use of ultrasound during pregnancy has emphasized the need for greater knowledge about normal and abnormal voiding function during fetal live. We describe the developmental changes in lower urinary tract function from the middle of the second to the early third trimester of gestation. Materials and Methods: The study included 22 male fetal pigs of 13 pregnant Goettingen minipigs (gestational period 111 to 115 days) with 11 fetuses in the middle of the second (median 61.5 days, 0.55 of term) and 11 fetuses in the beginning of the third trimester of gestation (median 80 days, 0.72 of term). With the sow under isoflurane anesthesia catheters were placed in the bladder, rectum and amniotic cavity of the fetuses, and a flow probe was placed around the distal urethra. After the sow was at light sleep urethral flow, amniotic pressure, abdominal pressure and bladder pressure were recorded a median of 241 minutes. Results: The recordings of 14 fetuses were evaluable. In the middle of the second trimester the fetuses showed an almost constant dribbling with a median flow of 0.2 ml. per minute and a median of 4 concomitant bladder contractions per minute of median 3.5 cm. H2O (detrusor pressure). At the beginning of the third trimester the fetuses had periods of staccato flow (median 0.2 ml. per minute, staccato frequency 1 to 2 Hz.) on top of contractions (median 4 contractions per minute, median detrusor pressure 5.5 cm. H2O) with no flow between voidings. Conclusions: Development of storage and voiding function in male pigs occurs between the mid-second and early third trimester of gestation, together with emergence of striated sphincter bursting activity, which interrupts flow in the urethra during the voiding phase.

N2  - Two peptides [NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (ADNF-9)], that are associated with novel glial proteins regulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, are shown now to provide protective intervention in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal demise and growth restrictions were produced after intraperitoneal injection of ethanol to pregnant mice during midgestation (E8). Death and growth abnormalities elicited by alcohol treatment during development are believed to be associated, in part, with severe oxidative damage. NAP and ADNF-9 have been shown to exhibit antioxidative and antiapoptotic actions in vitro. Pretreatment with an equimolar combination of the peptides prevented the alcohol-induced fetal death and growth abnormalities. Pretreatment with NAP alone resulted in a significant decrease in alcohol-associated fetal death; whereas ADNF-9 alone had no detectable effect on fetal survival after alcohol exposure, indicating a pharmacological distinction between the peptides. Biochemical assessment of the fetuses indicated that the combination peptide treatment prevented the alcohol-induced decreases in reduced glutathione. Peptide efficacy was evident with either 30-min pretreatment or with 1-h post-alcohol administration. Bioavailability studies with [3H]NAPVSIPQ indicated that 39% of the total radioactivity comigrated with intact peptide in the fetus 60 min after administration. These studies demonstrate that fetal death and growth restriction associated with prenatal alcohol exposure were prevented by combinatorial peptide treatment and suggest that this therapeutic strategy be explored in other models/diseases associated with oxidative stress.

N2  - Experiments were carried out to determine the threshold level of maternal nicotine that impairs protective responses of rat pups to hypoxia. From days 6 or 7 of gestation, pregnant rats received either vehicle or nicotine (1.50, 3.00, or 6.00 mg of nicotine tartrate.kg body wt-1day-1) or vehicle continuously via a subcutaneous osmotic minipump. On postnatal days 5 or 6, pups were exposed to a single period of hypoxia produced by breathing an anoxic gas mixture (97% N2 or 3% CO2) and their time to last gasp was determined, or they were exposed to intermittent hypoxia and their ability to autoresuscitate from hypoxic-induced primary apnea was determined. Perinatal exposure to nicotine did not alter the time to last gasp or the total number of gasps when the pups were exposed to a single period of hypoxia. The number of successful autoresuscitations on repeated exposure to hypoxia was, however, decreased in pups whose dams had received either 3.00 or 6.00 mg of nicotine tartrate/kg body wt; these dosage regimens produced maternal serum nicotine concentrations of 19 ± 6 and 35 ± 8 ng/ml, respectively. Thus our experiments define the threshold level of maternal nicotine that significantly impairs protective responses of 5- to 6-day-old rat pups to intermittent hypoxia such as may occur in human infants during episodes of prolonged sleep apnea or positional asphyxia.

N2  - Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a well-defined symptom complex and is frequently associated with sleep disturbance and a recognized family history. It occurs either as idiopathic RLS or in association with many medical, neurological or vascular disorders. The neurological examination and routine investigations in idiopathic RLS are normal. Polysomnography supports the diagnosis of RLS by documenting the associated sleep disturbances and periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). Although MRI studies disclose no intracerebral lesions, recent Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies point to some involvement of the basal and red nuclei and the cerebellum. No definitive etiology is known for this condition, but several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed. There is supportive evidence that RLS is a Central Nervous System (CNS) dysfunction, suggesting widespread involvement of the descending dopaminergic (DA) pathways, possibly originating in the diencephalon or upper brainstem. This is corroborated by the successful treatment of RLS with DA agents, sedatives, and neurotransmitters. However, RLS can also occur with spinal disorders and spinal cord lesions implying the existence of a spinal generator. The incidence of RLS in pregnancy is well known and its association with vascular disorders supports another mechanism in some patients. The primary treatment of RLS is largely symptomatic and quite effective with DA agents, DA agonists, opioids and other neurotransmitters. The treatment of RLS associated with various diseases is aimed at the correction of the underlying pathological or deficiency states. Antidepressant medications frequently precipitate or worsen the condition of RLS.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Indirect evidence suggests that adrenal steroid production in the human fetus may have a circadian rhythm. To assess whether there is a 24-hour rhythm of fetal cortisol in the human fetus, we investigated the relationship between fetal and maternal cortisol and cortisone concentrations in maternal, umbilical arterial, and umbilical venous blood samples over a 24-hour period. STUDY DESIGN: Elective cesarean sections were scheduled every 2 hours around the clock in 57 term (38-41 weeks' gestation) nonlaboring pregnant women. Plasma cortisol and cortisone concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The mean 24-hour cortisol concentration was higher in umbilical arterial than in umbilical venous blood samples, 63.6±4.6 ng/mL (SEM) versus 48.7±3.2 ng/mL, respectively (P < .05). Fetal plasma cortisol showed a rhythm in the umbilical artery (acme from noon to 4 PM) (1-way analysis of variance and least significant difference test; P < .05) but not in the umbilical vein. Umbilical arteriovenous differences showed no net transfer of cortisol to the fetus at any time of the day and net fetal production of cortisol from 8 AM to 6 PM. There was limited transfer of cortisone to the fetus and only in the 2 AM-to-noon time interval. CONCLUSION: These data suggest the presence of a 24-hour rhythm of fetal adrenal cortisol secretion that may be controlled by a fetal circadian pacemaker.

N2  - Galactorrhea, or inappropriate lactation, is a relatively common problem that occurs in approximately 20 to 25 percent of women. Lactation requires the presence of estrogen, progesterone and, most importantly, prolactin. Stress, suckling, sleep, sexual intercourse and medications may increase prolactin levels, whereas dopamine inhibits its release. The differential diagnosis of galactorrhea includes pituitary adenomas, neurologic disorders, hypothyroidism, numerous medications, breast stimulation, chest wall irritation and physiologic causes. The evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination, as well as selected laboratory and imaging studies to rule out secondary causes such as an intracranial mass or a tumor. Diagnostic studies include a pregnancy test, a prolactin level, renal and thyroid function tests and, if indicated, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Treatment options for prolactinomas include observation, dopamine agonists, surgery and radiation therapy, depending on tumor size and associated symptoms. Fortunately, the prognosis for patients with prolactinomas is good: most prolactinomas remain stable or regress. In pregnant women, prolactinomas must be observed closely because the lesions may greatly increase in size.

N2  - In the newborn, presence of sleep-wake cycles indicates integrity and maturity of the central nervous system. By spectral EEG analysis and polygraphic recordings subtle variations of EEG background activity and behavioural patterns corresponding to early sleep-wake cycles have been found in preterm infants as young as 27 weeks of gestation. The emergence of sleep-wake cycles at early gestational ages may have a positive predictive value for long-term neurological outcome. Sleep-wake cycles and their significance for later outcome have not been studied in very preterm infants so far. Accordingly, we prospectively investigated maturational changes of EEG activity and sleep-wake cycles in preterm infants below 30 weeks of gestational age using the Cerebral Function Monitor, an amplitude-integrated EEG. We present preliminary data on the emergence of sleep-wake cycles in preterm infants from this ongoing study. Of 100 infants enrolled during a 1-year period, 38 infants without neurological complications were included in the reference group. In this group (mean gestational age 27 weeks), we observed cyclical variations of EEG background activity resembling early sleep-wake cycles at a mean gestational age of 28 weeks and a median postnatal age of 6 days. It is hypothesised that these cyclical variations of EEG background activity may represent switches between thalamo-cortical and neo-cortical pattern generators and indicate integrity of central nervous system function. Amplitude-integrated EEG may thus serve as a useful non-invasive test for brain function in preterm infants.

N2  - Objective: To derive reference curves of polysomnographic parameters for clinically healthy infants and children in the first and second year of life. Study design: From January 1989 to December 1999 a total of 13 373 polygraphic sleep recordings were carried out at the sleep laboratory of the Vestische Kinderklinik Datteln, a tertiary referral centre for sleep-related respiratory problems in infants and children. In order to create a data base for reference curves, 681 recordings were retrospectively selected from the total pool, if the following criteria were fulfilled: first polygraphic sleep recording of the proband, clinically healthy term infants without symptoms of upper respiratory infection at the time of sleep study. Premature birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (< 2 500 g), apparent life-threatening events (ALTE), neonatal complications, known cardial, pulmonary, cerebral and metabolic disorders, dysmorphic syndromes, sudden infant death (SIDS) of a sibling, heavy parental smoking (> 10 cigarettes per day), and maternal drug addiction were exclusion criteria for the reference group. Recording and evaluation of polysomnographies were carried out according to published recommendations of the Pediatric Task Force of the German Sleep Society (DGSM). Results: Reference curves covering an age range of 1 to 24 months are presented for the following parameters: quiet and active sleep, coordinated and paradoxical patterns of thoracic and abdominal breathing movements, periodic breathing, frequency of respiratory pauses of ≥ 3 seconds, ≥ 5 seconds and ≥ 10 seconds duration, respectively, frequency, mean and maximal duration of respiratory pauses following a sigh, central, obstructive and mixed respiratory pauses, respectively, transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation of hemoglobin as measured by pulse oximetry, and instantaneous heart rate. Periodic breathing and apnea frequencies, especially obstructive apneas showed an asymmetric distribution of individual measurements. Conclusion: These reference curves facilitate the judgement of individual polysomnographic results to be adequate for age, to be deviating from the normal age range, or to be pathologic.

N2  - It is now recognized that high-level impulse noises penetrate the uterus of pregnant sheep, elevate thresholds of fetal auditory-evoked potential and produce damage to fetal inner ear hair cells. However, little is known about functional effects of airborne impulse noise on the late-term fetus. In the present study, the effects of a series of 20 impulses on the behavioral state of 6 fetal sheep were tested. Noise impulses produced 169.3 peak sound pressure level (pSPL) in air. Peak levels recorded near the fetal head averaged 161.1 dB. Impulses delivered to the fetus during periods of NREM sleep resulted in a decrease in average fetal heart rate (FHR) from 185 ± 22 beats/min (bpm) before stimulation to 174 ± 23 bpm 2-5 s after stimulation (p < 0.05). During REM sleep, an FHR acceleration occurred (before stimulation: 177 ± 24 bpm, after stimulation: 189 ± 31 bpm; p < 0.05). Impulse exposure during NREM sleep resulted in reductions in delta-, theta- and alpha-band powers. As a consequence, total power decreased from 100 to 72 ± 16% (p < 0.05). During REM sleep, stimulation provoked a short decrease in total band power from 100 to 73 ± 20% and a similar decrease in the theta- and beta-band powers. The results indicated that impulse noise evoked short-term alterations in FHR and cortical activity. These changes were mediated by auditory brain stem activation that led to cortical desynchronization during both NREM and REM sleep in late-term fetal sheep. Copyright © 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - The recent miniaturization of implantable radiotelemetric devices offers the possibility of an accurate, reliable, and simple phenotyping tool for long-term, hands-off measurement of blood pressure in unrestrained, untethered mice; however, use has been limited because of high morbidity and mortality in all but larger-than-average mice. Also, because the device was developed for abdominal aorta implantation at the renal artery level, its use has not been feasible in studies where infrarenal blood flow is critical, i.e., in pregnant mice. We provide details of a very successful alternative approach for implanting radiotelemeters in mice, whereby thoracic aortic implantation of the pressure-sensing catheter is combined with subcutaneous placement of the transmitter body along the right flank. We used female C57/BL6 (C57) or BPH/5 mice, a strain derived from the cross of inbred hypertensive and hypotensive mouse strains. We show that this is a reliable procedure for providing high-fidelity mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) recordings for 50-60 days in mice weighing 22 g on average but as small as 17 g. No morbidity or mortality was observed in either strain using this procedure. Importantly, neither strain fully recovered from anesthesia and surgery, as indicated by a return of normal circadian rhythms, until 5-7 days postsurgery. This was also reflected in significantly elevated baseline MAP and HR levels in both strains during this recovery period. Moreover, strain-related differences in relative increases in MAP during the first 5 days of recovery masked the significant elevation in BPH/5 baseline MAP (vs. C57) observed in fully recovered mice. This suggests that methods must allow at least 5-7 days recovery from surgery to provide accurate cardiovascular (CV) phenotyping in mice. Finally, we show that CV parameters can be monitored continuously before, during, and after pregnancy in mice using this alternative implantation approach. The device did not interfere with conception, gestation, delivery, or postnatal care of pups. These results demonstrate the feasibility of stress-free, long-term monitoring of CV parameters in pregnant or nonpregnant mice of typical size and offer exciting possibilities for application in CV functional genomic research.

N2  - Sleep problems are common in pregnant women. This review examines sleep in normal pregnancy; discusses the physiologic bases for alterations in sleep, including hormonal and mechanical factors; and correlates these factors with changes in sleep of pregnant women, as determined subjectively by surveys and objectively by polysomnographic studies. The changes in respiratory physiology during pregnancy, the possible predisposition of the pregnant woman to sleep-disordered breathing because of these changes, and results of published studies of sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy are discussed. Finally, the effect of pregnancy on other sleep disorders and the management of these sleep disorders during pregnancy are outlined, including changes in management necessitated by this state. The paucity of available data and the need for further studies of incidence and outcomes of sleep disorders in the pregnant woman are emphasized.

N2  - 1 We determined the effects of betamethasone on the fetal sheep electrocorticogram (ECoG) using linear (power spectral) and non-linear analysis. For non-linear analysis we used an algorithm based on the Wolf algorithm for the estimation of the leading Lyapunov exponent which calculates a prediction error based on the course of the time series in the phase space. A high prediction error stands for low predictibility or low regularity and vice versa. 2 After 48 h of baseline recordings, vehicle (n = 6) or betamethasone (n = 7) at 10 μg h-1 was infused over 48 h to the sheep fetus at 128 days gestational age (0.87 of gestation). 3 ECoG spectral analysis revealed no difference in power spectrum between vehicle- and betamethasone-treated fetuses. The prediction error of the ECoG during REM sleep was higher than during non-REM or quiet sleep in both groups (P < 0.0001) revealing lower causality of brain activity during REM sleep. During REM sleep, prediction error significantly decreased 18-24 h after onset of betamethasone treatment (P < 0.05) and returned to baseline values within the following 24 h of continued betamethasone treatment. No ECoG changes were found during quiet sleep. Non-linear ECoG changes during metabolically active REM sleep accompanied the previously described decrease in cerebral blood flow. 4 These results suggest that betamethasone in doses used in perinatal medicine acutely alters complex neuronal activity.

N2  - The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been found to be consistently higher in preterm and low birth weight infants than in infants born at term and this increase is inversely related to gestational age. The incidence and severity of apnoea of prematurity, are also inversely related to gestational age. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a neonatal history of apnoea/bradycardia affected the maturation of arousal responses. Twenty-five premature infants were studied. A perinatal risk score was determined for each infant and infants were divided into those with a neonatal history of apnoea/bradycardia (n=16) and those without (n=9). All infants were studied using daytime polysomnography on three occasions: (a) a preterm study around 36 weeks gestation, (b) within 3 weeks of term, and (c) 2-3 months post-term. Multiple measurements of arousal threshold (cmH2O) in response to air-jet stimulation applied alternately to the nares were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). Arousal thresholds were elevated in apnoeic infants compared to control infants in both AS (P<0.05) and QS (P<0.001) at the term study and in QS at 2-3 months post-term (P<0.01). In addition, arousal thresholds were positively correlated with perinatal risk score in both sleep states, in all studies, with the exception of AS at 2-3 months when all infants were readily arouseable. We conclude that a history of prematurity with neonatal apnoea has a persisting effect on decreasing arousabilty from sleep and these infants may be at increased risk for SIDS.

N2  - Background. The proportion of women who stop smoking during pregnancy has varied between 17 and 40% percent in Sweden with a tendency of lower prevalence in recent years. The aim of the present study was to examine the factors that might influence the ability to stop smoking during pregnancy. Method. One hundred and two women were interviewed shortly after their first visit to the antenatal clinic and a second time approximately one month after delivery. Two women who had late spontaneous abortions were excluded. The women were asked about background factors, smoking habits of their parents, smoking history and current smoking habits. The carbon monoxide in expiratory air was measured to verify reported smoking habits. Results. Fifty-six of the 100 participating women had stopped smoking before the second interview. Having started smoking at an older age, having no previous children, smoking few cigarettes, a higher level of education, positive support from the partner and having lived with non-smoking parents were all associated with stopping smoking when tested as single factors. Reported smoking habits could be verified. Age, smoking habits of the partner, passive smoking at work, quality of sleep, general perceived health, length of sick-leave or amount of nausea were not correlated to stopping smoking. Conclusion. The presence of several factors found to influence stopping smoking during pregnancy, and the tendency for smoking habits to be passed over to the new generation, are reasons for comprehensive and individualized, anti-smoking support.

N2  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the definition of daytime and nighttime on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in pregnancy. To determine the prevalence of a <10% decrease in mean arterial pressure with sleep (nondipper) in pregnancy and the consistency of nondipper status throughout pregnancy. In a prospective, longitudinal study, 102 pregnant woman underwent 24-h ABP monitoring and recorded sleep patterns at ≤14, 19 to 22, 27 to 30, 35 to 37 weeks' gestation and 5 to 9 weeks' postpartum. Nighttime was defined by arbitrary hours or actual periods of sleep. Ambulatory blood pressure measurements using the different definitions of nighttime were compared in the total cohort and individual women. Nondipper status of each woman was determined throughout pregnancy and postpartum. At 35 to 37 weeks' gestation, 19% of women napped during the day and 20% were awake during the night. Throughout pregnancy, mean day and night systolic and diastolic ABP measurements were similar whether daytime and nighttime were defined by arbitrary hours or by sleep periods. In individuals, the use of arbitrary hours (day 07:00 to 21:59, night 22:00 to 06:59) compared to sleep periods to define day and night resulted in differences in daytime systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of up to 4 and 5 mm Hg, respectively. Similarly there were individual differences in nighttime SBP up to 10 mm Hg and DBP up to 11 mm Hg. A third of women were nondippers at least once during pregnancy, but only two women were consistent nondippers. The different definitions of day and night did not change group ABP measurements, but resulted in significant variation in ABP measurements in individual pregnant women. Nondippers were common and nondipper status frequently changed during pregnancy. © 2001 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

N2  - Serum melatonin concentrations were studied in normal pregnant women and in women with several types of pathologic pregnancies, e.g., twins, preeclampsia or intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Blood samples were collected from the maternal antecubital vein at 14:00 hr (daytime) and 02:00 hr (nighttime) during pregnancy, and also from the umbilical vein and artery immediately after delivery. Serum melatonin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Daytime serum melatonin levels in normal (single fetus; singleton) pregnancies were low. While the levels showed an increasing tendency toward the end of pregnancy, no statistically significant changes occurred. On the other hand, the nighttime serum melatonin levels increased after 24 weeks of gestation, with significantly (P < 0.01) high levels after 32 weeks; these values decreased to non-pregnant levels on the 2nd day of puerperium. Nighttime serum melatonin levels were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in twin pregnancies after 28 weeks of gestation than in singleton pregnancies, whereas the patients with severe preeclampsia showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower serum melatonin levels than the mild preeclampsia or the normal pregnant women after 32 weeks of gestation. Melatonin concentrations in umbilical vessels showed a higher tendency in neonates who were born during at night compared with the other neonates; moreover, those in the umbilical artery were generally higher than those in the umbilical vein. The present results indicate that in humans, the maternal serum melatonin levels show a diurnal rhythm, which increases until the end of pregnancy, reflecting some pathologic states of the feto-placental unit. Fetuses may produce melatonin with a circadian rhythm.

N2  - QUESTION: I am treating a 27-year-old woman who is now in her 10th week of pregnancy. She smokes marijuana two to three times a week, but does not use other drugs. She also smokes 20 cigarettes a day. I am concerned about the effects of marijuana exposure on her baby. ANSWER: It is not always possible to isolate the effect of marijuana exposure from other possible confounders on pregnancy outcome. Although marijuana is not an established human teratogen, recent well conducted studies suggest it might have subtle negative effects on neurobehavioural outcomes, including sleep disturbances, impaired visual problem solving, hyperactivity, impassivity, inattention, and increased delinquency.

N2  - Introduction. The restless legs syndrome is characterized by an unpleasant sensation in the legs which causes an imperative need to move the legs and is therefore considered to be a disorder of movement. When it appears before going to sleep, it may interfere with falling asleep and lead to a sleep-deficit. Development and conclusions. It is a clinical condition with a satisfactory treatment, and improvement of the associated sleep disorder. The etiology is unknown, sometimes it is familial. The syndrome is increasingly often diagnosed, particularly in association with iron deficiency, during pregnancy, in chronic renal failure and in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Polysomnography is not necessary, unless one suspects an associated disorder of periodic leg movements. Treatment is by dopaminergic, opiate, benzodiazepine, anticonvulsant drugs or clonidine.

N2  - Important factors which may affect the fetal circulation are the fetal breathing movements (FBMs) and other movements adn the features of fetal circulation. Recent studies have demonstrated that FBMs are a normal phenomenon of intrauterine development and that there are two patterns of FBMs: (1) A predominant pattern of rapid, irregular (in rate and amplitude) episodic movements, with interspersed episodes of apnea that is present more than 50 percent of the time and accounts for more than 90 percent of the breathing activity. Interestingly, periodic sighs are often seen during these FBMs; (2) There is also a less frequent pattern of sporadic, slow (1 to 4 movements/min), deep inspiratory movements, like sighs or gasps, or espiratory efforts which resemble grunting, coughing, or panting. The first pattern, which represents normal fetal respiratory activity, only occurs during rapid eye movements (REM) sleep, and it is unrelated to changes in blood gases and pH values and to afferent impulses from aortic and carotid bodies; FBMs may produce intrathoracic pressure swings of 35 Torr or more and are independent of Hering-Breuer reflexes. This pattern is usually accompanied by increased FHR beat-to-beat variability and increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and flow (BF). Therefore, they may influence the velocimetry of B.F. in humans, e.g., RED and ARED in the umbilical artery blood flow (UABF), which do not necessarily indicate impending fetal demise. The second pattern is unrelated to the fetal behavioral state and blood gas tensions. Concerning the effects of drugs on FBMs, we have analysed the effects aminophylline (A)(bolus of 240 mg followed by 0.2 mg/kg/min) given to women not in labor; A caused a prompt and sustained FBMs that started as vorteces and then as regular inspiratory and expiratory movements, which increased in frequency (up to 88/min) and depth. Hexoprenaline given to pregnant women with threatened preterm labor were able to elicit FBMs and NFFV; the infusion of 0.3 microg/min increased UABF. Conjugated estrogens administered to the mother as a 10 mg bolus enhanced FBMs, as documented by TM and nasal flow velocity waveforms (NFFV); this was associated with an increased UABF; betamethasone (4 mg bolus to the mother) was shown to induce FBMs and an increased UABF. In a twin pregnancy betamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) was administered IV into the umbilical vein in one fetus and IM to the other; in both cases bradycardia and increase in UABF occurred, immediately after IV infusion, and after 30 min following IM injection FBMs were induced or enhanced in frequency and depth. The flow in MCA was unchanged. In conclusion, the fetal circulation is influenced by fetal behavioural states, particularly by FBMs that affect the fetal cardiovascular function, including blood pressure and FHR thereby conditioning the velocimetric response of its major vessels, i.e., UA and MCA BF, whose alterations do not necessarily reflect impending fetal demise.

N2  - Background: Studies indicate that women abused by their intimate partners are at increased risk for a number of health problems and have increased rates of health care utilization. However, these findings are based mainly on studies using clinic or health plan populations. In this study, we examined the association between intimate partner abuse (IPA) and health concerns and health care utilization in a population-based sample of adult women. Methods: We analyzed data on 2043 women aged 18 to 59 who participated in the 1998 Massachusetts Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a population-based health survey that included questions on IPA. IPA was defined as experiencing physical violence by, fear of, or control by an intimate partner. Consequences of IPA and self-rated health status and health care utilization of women experiencing IPA were examined. Results: A total of 6.3% of Massachusetts women aged 18 to 59 reported IPA during the past year. Women experiencing IPA were more likely than other women to report depression, anxiety, sleep problems, suicidal ideation, disabilities, smoking, unwanted pregnancy, HIV testing, and condom use. Women experiencing IPA were less likely to have health insurance, but received routine health care at similar rates as other women. Conclusions: These results indicate that women in the general population experiencing IPA are at increased risk for several serious emotional and physical health concerns. Most of these women are in routine contact with health care providers. These findings also suggest that the BRFSS may provide a valuable mechanism for tracking state-based IPA prevalence rates over time. (C) 2000 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

N2  - Time patterns of activity-rest rhythms during and after pregnancy are increasingly recognised as important factors for the well-being and health of young families. This longitudinal study examined activity-rest patterns of couples during late pregnancy and subsequently the alterations in the periodic structure of parental and neonatal time patterns during the first four months after birth. Part I concentrates on the effects of late pregnancy and birth to the mother's rest-activity patterns and those of the father and, after birth, what time pattern the infant developed. Part II attempts to clarify how activity patterns of the entire family agree or disagree with each other and investigates how the infant synchronises with the environment that includes the process of parent-infant interaction. Activity data of, so far, seven families (father, mother and child) were continuously recorded using non-invasive Actiwatch units. Recordings of parental activity started at the beginning of the 37th week of gestation, and were continued in parallel with the infants' recordings in three series of three weeks each until four months after birth: 1st to 3rd week, 7th to 9th week and 13th to 15th week of life. In a standardised diary, record was kept of household routines, parental activities, type of feeding, initiation of sleep or waking up. Activity data of seven non-pregnant women were collected and used as a control. Irregular nocturnal activity epochs occurred frequently in pregnant women and were absent in non-pregnant women. Period lengthenings and shortenings of the circadian rhythms appeared in both parents from prepartum to postpartum. Activity at night increased from prepartum to postpartum in mothers and fathers. Three infants showed a marked circadian rhythm between day 3 and 14 after birth. All seven infants showed a predominant circadian rhythm between day 8 and 19 after birth. The onset of daytime activity of mothers and their infants corresponded well to each other. Postpartum frequency spectra of parents and child always had some ultradian components in common. Time patterns of activity-rest rhythms of couples and parents are shown to be altered during and after pregnancy and we suggest that the infants' adaptation to the environment begins during the first week that includes the process of mother-infant interaction.

N2  - Neurulation is a complex process of histogenesis involving the precise temporal and spatial organization of gene expression. Genes influencing neurulation include proneural genes determining primary cell fate, neurogenic genes involved in lateral inhibition pathways and genes controlling the frequency of mitotic events. This is reflected in the aetiology and genetics of human and mouse neural tube defects, which are of both multifactorial and multigenic origin. The X-linked gene Nap1/2, specifically expressed in neurons, encodes a protein that is highly similar to the nucleosome assembly (NAP) and SET proteins. We inactivated Nap1/2 in mice by gene targeting, leading to embryonic lethality from mid-gestation onwards. Surviving mutant chimaeric embryos showed extensive surface ectoderm defects as well as the presence of open neural tubes and exposed brains similar to those observed in human spina bifida and anencephaly. These defects correlated with an overproduction of neuronal precursor cells. Protein expression studies showed that the Nap1/2 protein binds to condensing chromatin during S phase and in apoptotic cells, but remained cytoplasmic during G1 phase. Nap1/2 therefore likely represents a class of tissue-specific factors interacting with chromatin to regulate neuronal cell proliferation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To present the conclusions and associated recommendations for care developed by the Physical and Developmental Environment of the High-Risk Infant Center, Study Group on Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Sound, and the Expert Review Panel. STUDY DESIGN: A multidisciplinary group of clinicians and researchers reviewed the literature regarding the effect of sound on the fetus, newborn, and preterm infant and developed recommendations based on the best evidence. An Expert Review Panel reviewed the data and conclusions. RESULTS: The following recommendations are developed from the review of the literature and are clarified in the body of the article. (1) Women should avoid prolonged exposure to low-frequency sound levels (< 250 Hz) above 65 dB(A) during pregnancy. (2) Earphones or other devices for sound production should not be used directly attached to the pregnant woman's abdomen. (3) The voice of the mother during normal daily activities, along with the sounds produced by her body and those present in her usual surroundings, is sufficient for normal fetal auditory development. The fetus does not require supplemental stimulation. Programs to supplement the fetal auditory experience cannot be recommended. (4) Infant intensive care units should incorporate a system of regular noise assessment. (5) Sound limit recommendations are to maintain a nursery with an hourly Leq of 50 dB(A), an hourly L10 of 55 dB(A) and a 1-second Lmax of 70 dB(A), all A-weighted, slow response scale. (6) Infant intensive care units should develop and maintain a program of noise control and abatement in order to operate within the recommended permissible noise criteria. (7) Care practices must provide ample opportunity for the infant to hear parent voices live in interaction between parent and infant at the bedside. (8) Earphones and other devices attached to the infant's ears for sound transmission should not be used at any time. (9) There is little evidence to support the use of recorded music or speech in the environment of the high-risk infant. Audio recordings should not be used routinely or left unattended in the environment of the high-risk infant. CONCLUSION: The recommendations, if followed, should provide an environment that will protect sleep, support stable vital signs, improve speech intelligibility for the infant, and reduce potential adverse effects on auditory development.

N2  - Objective. To characterize different methods of monitoring neonatal effects associated with maternal opioid analgesia. Special focus was on the static-charge-sensitive bed (SCSB), which could potentially serve as a non-invasive neonatal monitor. Methods. 12 healthy, term newborns from normal pregnancies were included in this prospective, randomized, controlled study. Maternal labor analgesia was either intravenous fentanyl (n = 5) or paracervical bupivacaine blockade (n = 7). Neonatal recording from delivery to the age of 12 hours included continuous SCSB monitoring with ECG and oximeter for sleep states, respiration, oxygenation, heart rate, and body movements. In addition, umbilical blood pH, Apgar, Amiel-Tison's Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scoring (NACS), skin cyanosis scoring, blood pressure, rectal and skin temperatures, and skin blood flow measurements were performed. Results. The study was interrupted, because one baby in the fentanyl group had a significant decrease in oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) to 59%. This was considered to be residual effect of fentanyl and was treated with naloxone. SpO2 was generally lower in the fentanyl group. Epochs with SpO2 <90% were more frequent in the fentanyl group, especially during the active sleep (mean ± SD 11.9 ± 10.7% vs. 2.0 ± 1.7% of epochs, p = 0.034). Mean heart rate values were lower in the fentanyl group (121.1 ± 6.4 vs. 132.6 ± 6.8 beats per minute, p = 0.02), and this difference was seen during wake and all sleep states. Maximum heart rate values were lower in the fentanyl group, too. The opiate group had less quiet sleep than controls (9.6 ± 2.8% vs. 18.3 ± 8.3%, p = 0.05). NACS after birth was lower in the fentanyl group (median [range] 15 [13-26] vs. 22 [20-25], p = 0.004). Conclusions. Several differences were seen between the fentanyl and the control group babies. The SCSB method proved sensitive enough to find neonatal effects of maternal analgesia. Together with ECG and SpO2 monitoring, SCSB gives plentiful information on neonatal well-bering in a non-invasive way. Results of this study emphasize the importance of neonatal monitoring after maternal opiate use in labor.

N2  - Objective: Ultrasound studies of hourly urine production rate in human fetuses have suggested that a fall in urine production occurs in state 2F (fetal quiet sleep) secondary to a state-dependent decrease in renal blood flow. We sought to ascertain the relationship between fetal hourly urine production rate and behavioral state in the near-term ovine fetus, a model in which urine production and fetal brain activity can be directly measured. Methods: Six ewes with singleton pregnancies were prepared with vascular and amniotic fluid catheters. Fetuses were prepared with hindlimb vascular catheters, a bladder catheter, and biparietal ECoG electrodes. After at least 5 days of recovery (ga 130 ± 2 days; term = 145-150 days), each animal was monitored for a 6-h period. Urine production was measured by draining the bladder catheter through a drop counter and fetal ECoG was continuously recorded (sampling rate of 50 Hz). ECoG activity was analyzed using power spectral analysis and periods of active and quiet sleep identified using both signal amplitude and corresponding 85% spectral edge frequency. Results: Basal fetal arterial pH (7.36 ± 0.01), pO2 (22.0 ± 1.2 mmHg) and pCO2 (47.0 ± 1.6 mmHg) and plasma (295 ± 2 mOsm/kg) and urine (179 ± 3 mOsm/kg) osmolalities were within normal ranges. Active and quiet sleep comprised 50 ± 2 and 43 ± 1% time, respectively. There was no difference in hourly urine production rate in active sleep (21.4 ± 9.7 ml/h) and quiet sleep (18.8 ± 7.7 ml/h). Conclusions: 1) Hourly fetal urine production rate is independent of ECoG activity state in the near-term ovine fetus. 2) Assuming only minor species differences, ultrasound measurement of human fetal hourly urine production rate can be performed without concern for fetal neurobehavioral state changes.

N2  - Several studies attempted to evaluate the predictive value or the associated risk of several factors only on generic sleep disorders and mainly night-wakings. Aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of biological and historical and clinical factors on the different aspect of sleep behavior and disturbances evaluated by the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Mothers of 1157 children (583 M, 574 F) aged 6.5 to 15.3 years (mean 9.8) completed the SDSC together with a questionnaire on demographic data about family composition, parent's education and professional activities, as well as clinical data about pregnancy, delivery and medical history of the child with specific questions regarding pathologies that could affect sleep; sleep habits of parents and children were also investigated. Global sleep disturbances measured as SDSC total score were affected by co sleeping, early sleep disorders, adenotonsillitis, asthma and parents' sleep disorders. Early sleep disorders, asthma and parents' sleep disorders had a significant main effect on disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep. Sleep breathing disorders score was associated with the presence of cosleeping, adenotonsillitis, asthma, food allergy. Disorders of Arousal score was affected by early sleep disorders and parents' sleep disorders. There was a significant main effect of co-sleeping, early sleep disorder, adenotonsillitis, parents' sleep disorder on sleep-wake transition disorders score; of gender, parents' sleep disorder on Disorders of excessive somnolence score and of gender, early sleep disorder and parents' sleep disorder on Sleep hyperhydrosis score. Post-hoc comparisons showed that females vs. males have higher scores in Disorders of excessive somnolence score while males scored higher in Sleep hyperhydrosis score. A visual generalized model revealed that predictors for Total SDSC score are early sleep disorders, parents' sleep disorders, adenotonsillitis and asthma. Our results underline the role of genetic and neurobiological substrate on the development of children sleep, delineating the areas of the sleep that are involved and rising some suggestions on which factors could lead to different later sleep disturbances.

N2  - Phylogenetically prolactin is an old hormone that plays an important role in the physiology of fishes and reptiles as well as mammals. In humans, prolactin levels normally increase during sleep, pregnancy and lactation. Causes of abnormal hyperprolactinemia include exogenous factors, drugs and pituitary tumors. Functional hyperprolactinemia can result from central mechanisms interfering with dopamin metabolism. The most common symptom is impaired reproductive function. Prolactin secretion by the pituitary gland is regulated mainly through the inhibitory effect of dopamin. Treatment of hyperprolactinemia should be directed to the underlying disorder, if known. Most cases are treated with dopamin agonists. Patients with prolactinomas that do not repond to medical treatment will require surgery or radiotherapy. During pregnancy, prolactinomas can increase in size but most will respond to medical therapy.

N2  - Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were automatically monitored for 48 hours at 15-min intervals in 31 hospitalized pregnant women at low risk for BP disorder. Each of the recorded 56 data series for systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) and heart rate (HR) was chronobiologically assessed. A rhythm-adjusted mean (MESOR), 24-hour and harmonic amplitudes, 24-hour and harmonic acrophases were grouped by trimester of pregnancy and further subjected to analysis of variance. The repeatedly reported well-established lowering of BP MESOR was not detected in this particular sample, while, as anticipated, the HR MESOR increased statistically significantly in the course of pregnancy. Ultradian components, with a period from 1 to 12 hours and an amplitude higher than that of the 24-hour component, were found in 25% of the SAP data series recorded during the second and third trimesters. Such ultradian components were detected in only one of the 36 simultaneously recorded HR series. Analysis of the individual variability in the statistical endpoints, based on 9 women contributing records in each trimester of pregnancy, revealed in the course of pregnancy greater variability in circadian amplitude and acrophase than in the individual BP MESOR. Healthy pregnancy differentially affects the BP and HR chronomes. The reproducible individual BP MESOR, obtained by 48-hour monitoring at 15-min intervals in hospitalized pregnant women, may be useful in early diagnosis of gestational hypertension, but for detection of circadian hyper-amplitude-tension (CHAT), longer than 48-hour monitoring is needed.

N2  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS or cot death) was the major cause of post-neonatal infant death in many countries in the late 1970s and 1980s. There is now very strong evidence that public intervention campaigns targeting the prone sleeping position, which had been identified by epidemiological studies as a major risk factor, were followed by substantial falls in the rate of SIDS. In the present review we discuss the evidence on which current recommendations for the prevention of SIDS are based. The prone sleeping position is now clearly causally associated with SIDS. Further reductions in SIDS may be produced by recommending the back sleeping position as opposed to the side position. Maternal smoking in pregnancy and bed sharing by infants of mothers who smoke are also strongly associated with SIDS, but have been harder to influence. Paternal smoking has also been implicated, although the magnitude of the reported risk is small. Finally, breastfeeding, pacifier use and having the infant sharing the parents bedroom, but not the bed, may also reduce risk. Continued reductions in SIDS mortality will require innovative public health education to target these major risk factors, while building on the 'back to sleep' approach.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of critically timed sleep deprivation in major mood disorders (MMD) occurring during pregnancy and postpartum. Methods: Nine women who met DSM-IV criteria for a MMD with onset during pregnancy or within 1 year postpartum underwent a trial of either early-night sleep deprivation (ESD), in which they were sleep deprived in the early part of one night and slept from 03:00-07:00 h, or late-night sleep deprivation (LSD), in which they were deprived of sleep in the latter part of one night and slept from 21:00-01:00 h. Mood was assessed before the night of sleep deprivation, after the night of sleep deprivation, and after a night of recovery sleep (sleep 22:30-06:30 h) by trained clinicians, blind to treatment condition, using standardized scales. Results: More patients responded to LSD (nine of 11 trials: 82%) compared with ESD (two of six trials: 33%) and they responded more after a night of recovery sleep (nine of 11 nights: 82%) than after a night of sleep deprivation (six of 11 nights: 55%). Pregnant women were the only responders to ESD and the only nonresponders to LSD. Limitations: The small and heterogeneous sample size prevents us from making more definitive conclusions based on statistical analyses. Conclusions: Although the findings are preliminary, the results suggest that with further study, critically timed sleep deprivation interventions may benefit women with pregnancy or postpartum major mood disorders and potentially provide a viable alternative treatment modality for those women who are not candidates for pharmacologic or psychotherapeutic interventions. Such interventions are needed to help prevent the devastating effects of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period on the mother, infant, her family and society.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess sleep patterns and prevalence of sleep disturbances during pregnancy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design; prospective questionnaire. SETTING: Outpatient, private obstetric clinic. PARTICIPANTS: 127 consecutive patients, with women evaluated at one of four points in pregnancy, 8-12 weeks (n = 37), 18-22 weeks (n = 28), 25-28 weeks (n = 24), and 35-38 weeks (n = 38). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Questionnaire of sleep habits and sleep disturbances. RESULTS: A large percentage of the women experienced sleep disturbances during pregnancy, These problems included frequent night wakings, difficulty falling asleep, and symptoms of sleep apnea. Few differences in sleep patterns were found across pregnancy, although women were found to sleep more and nap more by the end of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, especially late in pregnancy.

N2  - Study Objectives: To test the hypotheses that: 1) an increase in endogenous progesterone levels during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle wild alter REM sleep and mood state, and 2) a decrease in endogenous progesterone levels during postpartum will also alter REM sleep and mood state. Design: A longitudinal descriptive study utilizing ambulatory polysomnography for two consecutive nights at seven time points. Setting: Subject's homes Participants: The first hypothesis was tested with 34 women studied during both the follicular and luteal phases of their menstrual cycle. The second hypothesis was tested with 31 women who completed the sleep studies during pregnancy and at one month postpartum. Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Women who ovulated (high levels of serum progesterone in the luteal phase) had shorter REM latency, more REM sleep, and more positive mood state compared to those who did not ovulate (low luteal progesterone). Compared to the third trimester (high progesterone), REM latency was significantly shorter at one month postpartum (low progesterone). Mood state was most positive at the second trimester and most negative at one month postpartum. Conclusions: REM sleep and mood state were related to low progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle, but postpartum REM sleep and mood state were related to increased wake time rather than changes in progesterone levels.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Insomnia is the subjective complaint of poor sleep or an inadequate amount of sleep that adversely affects daily functioning. For the past 4 decades, treatment of insomnia has shifted away from the use of barbiturates toward the use of hypnotic agents of the benzodiazepine class. However, problems associated with the latter (eg, next-day sedation, rebound insomnia, dependence, and tolerance) have prompted development of other agents. OBJECTIVE: This review describes the recently approved nonbenzodiazepine agent, zaleplon. METHODS: Studies of zaleplon were identified through a search of English-language articles listed in MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, with no limitation on year. These were supplemented by educational materials from conferences. RESULTS: The efficacy and tolerability of zaleplon have been documented in the literature. Zaleplon has been shown to improve sleep variables in comparison with placebo. Like most hypnotic agents, zaleplon can be used for problems of sleep initiation at the beginning of the night, but its short duration of clinical effect may also allow patients to take it later in the night without residual effects the next morning. Zaleplon can be taken < or = 2 hours before awakening without "hangover" effects. It is generally well tolerated, with headache being the most commonly reported adverse event in clinical trials (15%-18%). Compared with flurazepam, a long-acting benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agent, zaleplon causes significantly less psychomotor and cognitive impairment (P < 0.001). Zaleplon has not been studied in pregnant women or children. The dose of zaleplon should be individualized; the recommended daily dose for most adults is 10 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia has a substantial impact on daily functioning. If pharmacologic treatment is indicated for insomnia, the choice of an agent should be guided by individual patient characteristics.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has many consequences. There is an independent association between OSA and hypertension. The Sleep Heart Health Study reported that hypertension prevalence increased as sleep disordered breathing severity increased. The Nurses' Health Study noted an age-adjusted relative risk of cardiovascular events of 1.46 for occasional snorers and 2.02 for regular snorers, and a risk of stroke of 1.60 for occasional snorers and 1.88 for regular snorers. Sleep apnea is also associated with pulmonary hypertension, neurocognitive effects, depressed quality of life, motor vehicle accidents, awakening headache, childhood growth interruption, pregnancy-induced hypertension, fetal growth retardation, and disruption of the patients' bed-partners' sleep quality. Further research will examine the possibility of causality, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and outcomes of therapeutic interventions for OSA on the many consequences of OSA.

N2  - Objective. To describe the prevalence of various symptoms five months and twelve months after childbirth in two European countries, according to employment, financial difficulties and relationship with partner. Design Longitudinal multicentre survey with a similar design in France and Italy. Women were interviewed three times: at birth and twice after childbirth. At 12 months after childbirth, the survey was postal in both countries. Population. Women who had been delivered of their first or second baby in three maternity units in France and five units in Italy. Women who had multiple pregnancies, a stillbirth or known neonatal death were excluded. Results. The response rates were 83% in France and 88% in Italy. Fifteen symptoms were considered. The results were similar in the two countries and showed that the prevalence of most symptoms was higher at 12 months than at five months after childbirth. When their baby was one year old, more than half of the women reported backache, anxiety and extreme tiredness. Around one-third of women reported headache, lack of sexual desire, sleep disorders and depression. Piles, constipation and painful intercourse were also common. One year postpartum women with financial problems or a difficult relationship reported poor psychological health more frequently. Conclusion. Physical and emotional problems are common after birth, and they tend to increase over time. Backache, headache and piles can seriously interfere with day-to-day life. Sexual problems also may be a source of unhappiness for the woman and her partner. Extreme tiredness, anxiety and depression may make a woman feel guilty for not corresponding to the image of a healthy, happy and well-coping mother. There is a link between financial problems or a difficult relationship with her partner and her own wellbeing. Health professionals should be aware of the high prevalence of health problems among new mothers, and of the social context of women who are more likely to suffer from them. They should counsel the women in their care, in order to help them to find the best solution, be it medical or social in nature.

N2  - This longitudinal study examined the popular belief that cognitive performance is impaired during pregnancy. Both self-report and objective test data on cognitive performance were collected on six occasions from three groups of women at three monthly intervals. Ten women who initially planned a pregnancy, 18 women initially in the first trimester of pregnancy, and 24 non pregnant controls completed the study. At each data collection participants reported their perceptions of current everyday memory, sleep, health, exercise, depression, anxiety and stress levels, and undertook a set of cognitive tests examining vocabulary, reasoning, short term memory, working memory, and semantic memory. A personality test was taken once. The planning group showed a significant increase in reported forgetting during pregnancy, and significantly more variability in sleep patterns than the control group over the test period. However, there were no other differences between groups on self-report or objective test results at any time phase. The personality factor of conscientiousness and level of reported anxiety were significant predictors of reported absentmindedness and forgetting on errands. The reported increase in forgetting in some pregnant women is possibly related to a complex interaction of personality and particular life situations. However, the precise nature of any objective change in memory performance during pregnancy is not yet clear.

N2  - Tiffany, a 3-year-old girl, was referred to the developmental and behavioral pediatrics service for evaluation of significant and persistent negative behaviors associated with refusal to eat at meal time and constant snacking during the past 3 months. She lost 2 pounds, but her weight for her height was at the 50th percentile. Her mother indicated that Tiffany had frequent night awakenings (>10) and late sleep onset (between 12:00 and 1:00 a.m.). Her mother described her as being "easily frustrated," getting upset and angry very quickly. Tiffany was identified at an early intervention program as having mild to moderate developmental delays in pragmatic speech, gross and fine motor skills, and social interaction skills. Tiffany was born at 33 weeks gestation and was hospitalized for 10 days without significant perinatal problems. She was readmitted at 2 months of age when she was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux, lactose intolerance, sleep apnea, and bradycardia. She was discharged with an apnea monitor. A seizure disorder was diagnosed at 1 year of age and reactive airway disease at 2 years of age. At the time of the referral to the developmental and behavioral pediatrics service, Tiffany was followed by multiple services, including cardiology, neurology, gastroenterology, psychology, and pulmonary. Pharmacologic therapies included albuterol and cromalyn inhalers, phenobarbital, valproic acid, levocarnitine, ranitidine, and an inhaled steroid. She continued to use the apnea monitor each night, although three sleep studies demonstrated a normal sleep pattern with no evidence of apnea or bradycardia. A recent electroencephalogram was normal. Tiffany lives with her mother and maternal grandparents. Her mother is morbidly obese with a history of asthma and depression. She was infertile for a 10-year period, which she attributed to the stress associated with living with an abusive man. Tiffany was the result of a subsequent, brief relationship with another man; she has not had contact with her father. Her mother is a licensed practical nurse who has not worked as a nurse since Tiffany's birth. An interdisciplinary treatment approach to Tiffany's multiple biological and behavioral problems was implemented by admitting her to a collaborative care unit at a children's hospital.

N2  - The fetal biological clock is an endogenous clock capable of generating circadian rhythms and responding to maternal entraining signals. By at least the third trimester of pregnancy fetal diurnal rhythms are entrainable by maternal day-night rhythms. Maternal illness during pregnancy and premature birth are obvious clinical factors that may adversely affect circadian rhythm development. Premature birth of the fetus has a most dramatic impact on maternal fetal interactions. The effect on biorhythms appears to be temporary and is greatest on the most immature infants. The results to date support the importance of fetal circadian rhythms and the relative lack of these rhythms in the preterm infant. It is well known that growth and development in the prematurely born infant are influenced by a multitude of factors; clearly, the neonatal intensive care unit is not a surrogate for the maternal placental unit. This article reviews what is known about circadian development in the human infant with an emphasis on the unique circumstances of the preterm infant. The research on the short- and long-term effects of environmental interventions on circadian, sleep, and neurologic development is discussed. Although an earlier onset of circadian development did not result with cycled lighting in the neonatal nursery, there may still be important biological effects that have not been studied. There are sufficient data to state that there is no reason for continuing a chaotic, noncircadian environmental approach for the care of the prematurely born infant. Copyright (C) 2000 by W.B.

N2  - Adverse perinatal events affecting cerebral functions are a major cause of neonatal mortality, morbidity, and long-term neurologic deficit. Intrapartum fetal EEG, which records fetal brain electrical activity, provides a monitoring modality for evaluating the fetal CNS during labor. In this study, we describe a new approach to such monitoring that is based on real-time spectral analysis of the fetal EEG during labor. Fourteen pregnant women with uncomplicated term pregnancies who went into labor participated in the study. Two suction-cup electrodes were applied to the fetal scalp at the occipitoparietal or parietal region after rupture of membranes. Real-time spectral analysis was used to determine the frequency and amplitude of the fetal EEG signal. The spectral edge frequency (SEF) was calculated as the frequency below which 90% of the power in the power spectrum resides. The average EEG amplitude and the SEF were displayed using the density spectral array technique. Fetal heart rate and intrauterine pressure were also measured. Two fundamental EEG patterns were identified: high-voltage slow activity and low-voltage fast activity. The SEF was found to be an excellent index of cyclic EEG activity. Fetal heart rate demonstrated increased variability and an elevated baseline during low-voltage fast activity, whereas both parameters decreased during high-voltage slow activity. During episodes of variable decelerations in the fetal heart rate, a decrease in the SEF was observed, accompanied by an increased EEG voltage. The results obtained substantiate the presence of sleep cycles in the human fetus. This kind of cortical activity monitoring may enable rapid alertness to cerebral hypoxia and allow for prompt intervention, thereby decreasing the risk for birth asphyxia and subsequent brain damage.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the circadian rhythm of blood pressure during pregnancy. DATA SOURCES: Computerized searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL, and MIRLYN. STUDY SELECTION: Selected studies from 1 969 to 1997 were evaluated. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and information was organized under the following areas: definition of and the interconnection between circadian rhythm and blood pressure; the circadian variability of blood pressure throughout the trimesters; the patterns of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure in pregnancies defined as normal and those complicated by chronic hypertension and preeclampsia; and clinical implications. DATA SYNTHESIS: The circadian rhythm of blood pressure in pregnancy is the same as in the non-pregnant state, with a nocturnal decrease, especially during sleep. In patients with chronic hypertension, the nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be steeper. Patients with mild preeclampsia may experience a less pronounced nocturnal decrease in blood pressure. Patients with severe preeclampsia may display a reversed circadian rhythm, with no decrease and/or an increase in nocturnal blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure during normal pregnancy and pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension and preeclampsia warrant consideration when monitoring patients and implementing management plans.

N2  - With the aim to describe the daily pattern of blood pressure during the trimesters of pregnancy in clinically healthy women as well as in pregnant women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, we analyzed 1494 blood pressure series systematically sampled by ambulatory monitoring for 48 hours every 4 weeks after the first obstetric visit in 124 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 55 with gestational hypertension, and 23 with a final diagnosis of preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of blood pressure variation for each group and trimester of gestation was established by population multiple-component analysis. A highly statistically significant circadian pattern represented by a linear model that includes components with periods of 24 and 12 hours is demonstrated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure for all groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (P<0.001 in all cases). The differences in circadian rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly statistically significant in all trimesters (always P<0.001). There is also a statistically significant difference in circadian amplitude (extent of daily change) of blood pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies in all trimesters (always P<0.004). Results further indicate similar circadian characteristics between women who later developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy. The difference between these 2 groups in circadian mean is statistically significant in the second trimester for systolic (P=0.022) but not for diastolic blood pressure (P=0.986). In the third trimester, the difference in circadian mean is highly statistically significant for both variables (P<0.001). The differences in blood pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as in the first trimester of pregnancy. Those highly significant differences are found when both systolic and diastolic blood pressure for women with a later diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia are well within the accepted normal physiological range of blood pressure variability. These differing changes in the circadian pattern of blood pressure with advancing gestational age between healthy and complicated pregnancies offer new end points that may lead to an early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy as well as to the establishment of prophylactic intervention.

N2  - The prevalence of depressive disorders in women is twice that in men. This gender difference emerges around the time of puberty and persists through the childbearing years. Reproductive events and psychosocial factors are important influences on depression in women. Women often present with atypical depressive symptoms and comorbid disorders that can complicate both diagnosis and treatment. Sex differences in pharmacokinetics have been noted, as well as differences in antidepressant treatment response. While sleep disturbances, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain may be part of the constellation of depressive symptoms, they are also important considerations in selecting a treatment option for depressed women.

N2  - Background: Although nitrous oxide (N2O) is used commonly during anesthesia, clinically relevant advantages-disadvantages of using this agent are not well established in the ambulatory setting. This study in women undergoing ambulatory gynecologic surgery compares outcomes in patients administered total intravenous anesthesia with propofol versus the propofol plus N2O. The primary outcome was the time to home readiness. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of postanesthetic adverse events. Methods: Women presenting for elective ambulatory termination of pregnancy or gynecologic laparoscopy were induced with an intravenous sleep dose of propofol and fentanyl. After induction, subjects were randomly allocated to maintenance anesthesia with propofol alone or propofol plus 65% N2O. Patients were assessed by a blinded observer in the postanesthetic care unit at 20-min intervals to determine home readiness. Postoperative pain and nausea were measured with visual analog scales. Postoperative analgesics and antiemetics were recorded. The incidence of adverse events occurring after hospital discharge was assessed by a telephone interview 24 h postoperatively. Results: A total of 740 patients received propofol alone, and 750 patients received propofol plus N2O. Mean home readiness times were not significantly different between treatment groups. There were no significant differences between groups in pain scores, nausea scores, analgesia administration, or antiemetic administration before discharge. There were no significant differences in the frequency of adverse events for 24 h after discharge from hospital Conclusions: Omission of N2O from a propofol-based anesthetic for ambulatory gynecologic surgery does not affect time to home readiness or the incidence of postoperative adverse events up to 24 h after discharge from hospital.

N2  - Study Objectives: Pre-eclampsia is currently the predominant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Diurnal blood pressure variation is flattened or reversed in pre-eclampsia; however, sleep has not been extensively investigated in this disease. Our objective was therefore to study sleep architecture in this group of patients. Study Design: Full polysomnography using the Compumedics Sleepwatch System® or Compumedics p-series. Setting: NA. Patients: 25 pre-eclamptic patients and 17 primigravidas with normal pregnancies and no history of cardiovascular disease or sleep disorder. With the exception of one subject, all pre-eclamptics were taking clonidine (a known suppressant of rapid eye movement-REM-sleep) for control of their hypertension. Interventions: NA. Results: Pre-eclamptic subjects had markedly altered sleep architecture, with a markedly increased percentage of time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS) (21 * 2% versus 43 * 3%, p < 0.001). There was a longer latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (92 * 11 mins vs. 205 * 23 mins in control and pre-eclamptic subjects, respectively, p<0.001) and reduced time spent in REM (18 * 1% and 10 * 2% in control and pre-eclamptic subjects, respectively, p<0.001). Conclusions: While the increased REM latency and decreased REM time are most likely due to clonidine, this is unlikely to also account for the increased SWS. Two possible explanations for this include cerebral edema and release of cytokines, which are known to alter sleep structure.

N2  - There is a genetic contribution to the idiopathic restless legs syndrome (iRLS). An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is suspected, but as yet no gene has been identified. To assess the frequency and characteristics of the hereditary restless legs syndrome (RLS) in comparison to those of non-hereditary RLS, we analysed the clinical data of 300 RLS patients. All 300 patients diagnosed as RLS according to the criteria of the International RLS Study Group were examined using a standard questionnaire covering demographic data, family history, clinical symptoms, subjective sleep disturbances and course of the disease. In all patients a complete neurological examination was performed, and in selected cases electrophysiological examinations and polysomnographic studies. Family history was rated as definitely positive when at least one first-degree relative was examined and classified as RLS according to the criteria by one of the authors. If it proved impossible to contact family members to verify reports of a family history, the patients were classified as only having a 'possible positive family history.' 232 of the 300 patients had iRLS and 68 secondary RLS due to uremia (uRLS). 42.3% of the patients with iRLS and 11.7% of those with uRLS were classified as having 'definite positive' hereditary RLS, with a further 12.6% of iRLS patients and 5.8% of uRLS patients as having 'possible positive' hereditary RLS. Patients with definite hereditary RLS were significantly younger at the age of onset than those with a negative family history (35.45 vs. 47.17 years, p<0.05). The clinical characteristics of the disease were similar in both groups, except that women with hereditary RLS experienced a worsening of symptoms during pregnancy (19.1% vs. 2.6%, p<0.05). Our study shows that patients with hereditary RLS may experience an earlier onset of the disease. Hereditary and non-hereditary RLS present with similiar clinical signs and symptoms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: More than a third of women experience back pain during pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the review was to assess the effects of preventive interventions and treatments for backache in pregnancy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of any treatment to reduce the incidence or severity of back pain in pregnancy, or to prevent back pain arising in pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: One trial of 109 women was included. This cross-over trial compared the use of a special shaped pillow to fit under the woman's abdomen (Ozzlo pillow) with a standard pillow. Women experienced less pain in the week when they used the Ozzlo pillow than in the week with the standard pillow (odds ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.58). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Specially shaped pillows appear to help reduce back pain in late pregnancy and improve sleep.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The difference between night and day may be reinforced in young babies by offering a 'focal feed' between 10pm and midnight and gradually lengthening the intervals between night-time feeds by a variety of other activities (such as nappy changing, re-swaddling and walking with the infant). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of using a structured training programme to teach exclusively breastfed infants to sleep through the night by eight weeks old. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register. SELECTION CRITERIA: Acceptably controlled trials of a structured programme accentuating the difference between night and day compared with no intervention in first time parents of singleton babies, with mothers intending to exclusively breastfeed their infants for at least eight weeks post-partum. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: One trial involving 33 couples was included. More infants in the treatment group were sleeping throughout the night by eight weeks of age than in the control group (odds ratio 0.04, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.21). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence to show that first time parents using a structured sleeping programme can teach their babies to sleep through the night by eight weeks of age.

N2  - The 1998 Women and Sleep Poll sponsored by the National Sleep Foundation demonstrated the prevalence of sleep problems in American women. Specifically, more than 73% of premenopausal women have sleep complaints; 56% of postmenopausal women report insomnia. In addition to insomnia, women are faced with other sleep problems associated with menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, as well as medical disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless-legs syndrome, and periodic limb movement disorder. The sleepiness associated with these conditions must be separated from the classic inherited condition, narcolepsy. This review will center on the predominant sleep complaints encountered by ob/gyns. An approach to evaluation, management, and referral will be presented. A review of simple patient questionnaires, validated behavioral protocols, and medications that can be included in a busy office or hospital practice are included.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic movement disorder that is often associated with a sleep complaint. Patients with RLS have an irresistible urge to move their legs, which is usually due to disagreeable sensations that are worse during periods of inactivity and often interfere with sleep. It is estimated that between 2 and 15 percent of the population may experience symptoms of RLS. Primary RLS likely has a genetic origin. Secondary causes of RLS include iron deficiency, neurologic lesions, pregnancy and uremia. RLS also may occur secondarily to the use of certain medications. The diagnosis of RLS is based primarily on the patient's history. A list of questions that may be used as a basis to assess the likelihood of RLS is included in this article. Pharmacologic treatment of RLS includes dopaminergic agents, opioids, benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants. The primary care physician plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of RLS.

N2  - Background: There is a need to identify, as early as possible, infants who are at risk for long-term neurological morbidity. Methods: To predict neurodevelopment outcome of preterm infants <30 weeks' gestation in a population of 100 infants, we used several neonatal and neurobehavioral tests, including cranial ultrasonography, the Prechtl neurological test, quality of spontaneous general movements, and quality of sleep-wake organization. Results: The Prechtl test at corrected term age and findings on cranial sonograms both had high specificity, but the Prechtl test had better overall positive predictive power for normal neurological and developmental outcomes at 2 years' corrected age. Developmental changes in sleep and the amount of indeterminate sleep did not correlate with outcome. Scoring general movement quality did not predict outcome and did not augment the positive predictive power of the Prechtl test. Conclusions: The Prechtl test at corrected term age (independent of the other tests) is the best positive predictor of normal neurological outcome and Bayley test results at 2 years' corrected age.

N2  - Since the introduction of antidepressants in the 1950s, it was assumed for the next several decades that there were no special reasons to look at the application of these medications to women. In the past half-century, particularly in the past decade, since the advent of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI), a series of specific foci have developed. Firstly, there appear to be differences in the degree of response to particular antidepressants between the genders. Secondly, there is data concerning hormonal effects of particular relevance to women, i.e. prolactin, which separates out among the antidepressants. Also of concern to women are the potential teratogenic effects of these medications, which impact on their use during pregnancy. Finally, there are certain diagnostic syndromes that are particularly relevant to women: premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD); postpartum depression (PPD) and perimenopausal depression (PMD). It appears that the SSRIs may be more effective, relative to the older tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), in women than in men. The SSRIs have shown to be effective in treating these disorders, with the possibility of intermittent luteal phase treatment of PMDD. Non-antidepressant (AD) approaches have generally been found to be less effective. In the first trimester of pregnancy, there is data available supporting the safe use of SSRIs, particularly those first released, i.e. fluoxetine and sertraline. Finally, all SSRIs, with the exception of sertraline, can increase the risk of hyperprolactinaemia. This can lead to a variety of complications including amenorrhea and osteoporosis. This effect of sertraline, due to its unique profile in blocking re-uptake of dopamine, extends itself into additional relative benefits for sleep and memory. The issues associated for women with bipolar disorder are dealt with in terms of both increased risk of relapse during pregnancy and postpartum periods, as well as the relative risk of use of lithium and mood stabilizers in pregnancy and lactation.

N2  - 30 Pregnant women in their third trimester of pregnancy were compared with 30 age and height matched non pregnant married premenopausal women as controls. Both the groups were warded for a minimum period of 24 hours and monitored by the first investigator for snoring for a minimum period of six hours of sleep. In addition, the history of snoring (from the spouses), and other symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea were obtained. A full otolaryngological clinical examination and measurements of fundal height, BMI (body mass index), and abdominal girth was carried out. Snoring was observed in 20 out of 30 pregnant women (67%) and none in the control group. The mean BMI, abdominal girth, and the fundal height were significantly greater in the pregnant snorers as compared to the pregnant non-snorers.

N2  - Pain management for premature infants raises challenging questions for nurses. This group of infants is often physiologically fragile and they may undergo frequent painful procedures on a daily basis. Contrary to ideas from the past, premature infants are able to feel pain, and nervous system elements required for the transmission of painful stimuli are functional by 24 weeks gestation. Painful procedures are harmful to the infant's physiological stability and the ability to self-regulate, which includes maintenance of motor control and stable sleep/wake cycles. Assessment of pain in the premature infant is complex. Major indicators of pain include facial grimaces and physiological parameters such as heart rate and oxygen saturation. The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) is one tool designed specifically for preterm infants. Nonpharmacological nursing measures such as swaddling or nesting and offering a pacifier are useful strategies to help infants cope with painful procedures. The nurse may also maintain a therapeutic environment to assist the infant in self-regulation. Pharmacological agents such as morphine, fentanyl, and acetaminophen are effective in relieving procedural pain. The use of oral sucrose before and during painful procedures offers new possibilities for pain relief. Recent research shows that oral sucrose is a safe and effective analgesic for short-term procedures. Research studies to determine the most effective doses and modes of oral sucrose administration are ongoing. It is thought that the relief of pain is owing to the sweet taste of the sucrose that activates endogenous pain-modulating systems. © 2000 by the American Society of Pain Management Nurses.

N2  - A study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a health promotion campaign on 6 major preventative actions for infant health is presented. The study is financed by the italian Ministry of Health within the National Health Plan 1998-2000 research framework. The 6 preventative actions were chosen as those where the evidence for the effect of behavioural change is stronger and include: periconceptional administration of folic acid, avoidance of smoking during pregnancy and at home, back to sleep position, exclusive and prolonged breast feeding, safe transport in car and immunizations. Young couples and parents are addressed through both health professionals (family doctors and perinatal health services) and the media. The study, design is based on a comparison of the prevalence of prevertative behaviours among the target population before and after the intervention. The study area includes three different italian Regions for a total population of almost 3 millions. Expected outcomes of the study include information on baseline altitudes and behaviours of parents and on health promotion strategies which address infant and child health.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effects of prenatal nicotine exposure on the neurogenic control of neonatal heart rate. Methods: Thirty-six healthy newborns (20 boys and 16 girls) with a mean age of 52 h were examined by means of Holter ECG recordings during quiet sleep (QS), active sleep (AS) and awake states. Seventeen of the mothers had smoked during pregnancy and 19 were non-smokers. To compare the neonatal autonomic control of heart rate between the smoking and the non-smoking groups, heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated with spectral analysis of R-R intervals and the mean values of 2-min epochs. Total power, low-frequency power (LF), high-frequency power (HF) and the low to high frequency ratio (LF/HF) were examined. The LF/HF ratio is considered to reflect sympathovagal balance. Results: Prenatal exposure to nicotine did not influence the total power or the high- or low- frequency components. Boys had a tendency to higher HRV than girls and this was significantly higher at LF during QS. On combining the effects of maternal smoking and gender, boys with smoking mothers had a lower LF/HF ratio than boys with non-smoking mothers: 0.87 ± 0.37 and 1.34 ± 0.51, respectively (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Smoking during pregnancy may have a different effect on the sympathovagal balance in the development of the fetal male autonomic nervous system than on that of the female.

N2  - There has been considerable interest in heart rate (fH) fluctuations in relation to cardiovascular control systems and foetal conditions during pregnancy in mammals. Prominent fluctuations in fH also occur in avian embryos, which are an important experimental model for studying developmental physiology. The present study determined the instantaneous fH of seven chick embryos continuously from the last stage of prenatal development (day 18), throughout the pipping (perinatal) period (days 19-21) until hatching and, subsequently, of newly hatched chicks (up to day 2). The distinctive patterns of instantaneous fH fluctuations took the form of specific changes within a broad mean fH baseline. Cyclic oscillations (ultradian rhythm) occurred until an early stage of the perinatal period, when the fH baseline started rising. Subsequently, the baseline dropped and respiratory arrhythmia began to appear concomitant with external pipping. During the final stage of external pipping, when the fH baseline rose again prior to hatching, three unique patterns of instantaneous fH fluctuations were evident: relatively long-lasting cyclic small accelerations, irregular intermittent large accelerations and short-term repeated large accelerations. Furthermore, repeated alternate occurrences of the latter two types of acceleration formed an additional oscillating pattern with a period of 10-15 min. During the early period after hatching, when the fH baseline reached its maximum, instantaneous fH changed relatively slowly accompanied by transient rapid decelerations, probably due to augmented vagal tone. Subsequently, the mean fH baseline dropped to its minimum, and a circadian rhythm and three types of previously reported fH fluctuations (types I-III) appeared. Developmental patterns of mean fH and the appearance of distinctive patterns of instantaneous fluctuations in fH and circadian rhythms were not influenced by an ultimate failure of hatching after a normal development. The demonstration of complex, repeatable patterns of fH fluctuation that change during development suggests that the avian embryo model should be useful in studying the phenomenon of fH fluctuation and its underlying causes.

N2  - Objective: To determine the effects of external light stimulation on fetal behavioral states and know the difference from those of vibroacoustic stimulation. Methods: A flashlight and a vibroacoustic stimulator was applied directly on the maternal abdomen to determine the response of 56 normal fetuses at 36-40 weeks gestation. Fetal heart rate (FHR) and body movements were recorded using an actocardiograph, and fetal eye movements were observed using real-time ultrasonography. Using Nijhuis's criteria, the fetal behavioral states (1F-4F) were determined. FHR acceleration was considered a fetal response to the stimulations. Results: The lag time between stimulation and fetal response was within 4 s. A positive response rate to the light stimulation was higher at behavioral states 2F (82%) and 3F (83%) than at state 1F (4%). Light stimulation changed the behavioral state of two of the six 3F fetuses (33%) from 3F to 4F. No change of state was observed in fetuses that were in states 1F and 2F. For vibroacoustic stimulation, fetal response was 100% positive and changes of states were observed frequently irrespective of the behavioral state before the stimulation. Conclusion: Fetal response to light stimulation is closely connected to fetal behavioral states and may reflect some distinct stages of the sleep-wakefulness cycle.

N2  - A case of an infant who had morphine exposure during and following pregnancy while her mother was treated with intrathecal (i.t.) morphine is presented along with a review of the relevant literature. Successful maternal pain management was achieved during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Minimal maternal serum and breast milk levels in the first 7 postpartum weeks were found. Also, infant sleep and arousal behavior and general development at 2 and 7 months were unremarkable, illustrating the possible safe and efficacious use of i.t. morphine during and following pregnancy. Further work is required to understand opioid pharmacology during breastfeeding, which will be used to develop an empirical approach to breastfeeding and morphine use.

N2  - QUESTION: I have a 30-year-old pregnant patient who is asthmatic and is taking prednisone. Whenever she decreases her prednisone dose, her nausea increases tremendously even though she is taking two tablets of doxylamine and pyridoxine combination (Diclectin®) daily. She is already at 26 weeks' gestation, and I really do not want her to continue the prednisone beyond what is needed for her asthma, but two attempts to taper prednisone off failed because of unbearable nausea. ANSWER: Several controlled trials show the efficacy of prednisone for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), but your case is fascinating in proving the point by challenge-rechallenge. You should try to decrease the prednisone while increasing doxylamine and pyridoxine to its recommended dose of two tablets before sleep, one in the morning, and one in the afternoon.

N2  - The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome has been found to be consistently higher in preterm and low birth weight infants than in infants born at term. Failure to arouse from sleep is one possible mechanism for sudden infant death syndrome. This study compared the arousal responses to nasal air-jet stimulation in a longitudinal study between groups of healthy preterm and term infants. Preterm infants (n = 9) were born at 31-35 wk gestation with normal birth weights for gestational age and studied on three occasions: a preterm study at 36 wk, at 2-3 wk post-term, and at 2-3 mo post- term. Term infants (n = 22) were born at 37-42 wk and were studied at 2-3 wk and 2-3 mo post-term. Arousal thresholds were determined in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). In preterm infants, there was no state-related difference in arousal thresholds at either the 36 wk or 2-3 wk study; however, at 2-3 mo, arousal threshold was significantly greater in QS than AS (p < 0.05). In contrast, in term infants, arousal thresholds were significantly elevated in QS compared with AS at both 2-3 wk and 2-3 mo (p < 0.001). Arousal thresholds in AS were not different between the two groups of infants, with both groups of infants remaining readily arousable. However, in QS at 2-3 mo, arousal thresholds were significantly lower in the preterm infants (p < 0.05). This study has demonstrated that arousability is altered by gestational and postnatal age. The lower arousability that characterizes QS in term infants regardless of age is not evident in preterm infants until 2-3 mo post-term age.

N2  - Placental progesterone metabolites may influence fetal behaviour during late gestation. We have investigated the effect of the neuroactive metabolite, pregnanolone, on the sleep/awake behaviour of fetal sheep. These studies can only be effectively performed in unanesthetized animals with chronically implanted leads and catheters. The relatively large internal volumes of these catheters raises problems for cerebroventriclear infusions. Therefore, we developed a device with negligible deadspace (~10 μl) consisting of a ventricular cannula attached to a small cap which allowed the instillation of μl volumes of neuroactive steroids into a cerebral ventricle of fetal sheep in utero. Two catheters attached to the cap allow it to be filled in a push-pull configuration. The smaller internal diameter of the ventricular cannular prevents the solution entering the ventricle until the outflow catheter is occluded and solution is forced through the probe. Using this device, the infusion of 5β-pregnane-3α-ol-20-one (pregnanolone, 1 mg), in 35% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, resulted in a marked suppression of fetal behaviour parameters indicative of arousal, while vehicle alone did not affect these parameters. We conclude that neuroactive steroids can be infused into the cerebroventricular system of chronically catheterised fetal sheep in small volumes and that pregnanolone may act directly to influence fetal behaviour.

N2  - To determine whether gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in culture without the hypothalamus secrete GnRH in a pulsatile fashion, the nasal placode (NAP) was obtained at day 13.5 of gestation and cultured by a roller tube method. If the GnRH release occurs in a pulsatile fashion, it can be said that the pulse generator of GnRH exists inherently in each cell or community of cells in the culture. The concentration of GnRH in the NAP culture medium collected at 8-min intervals for 160 min after 2- to 4-week cultures showed that GnRH release occurred in a pulsatile fashion with a mean interpulse interval of 29.8 ± 2.3 min (n = 9). When the NAP was cultured with tissues of the forebrain vesicle (n = 3) or the hypothalamus (n = 4), GnRH was also released in a pulsatile fashion with similar intervals (27.3 ± 1.0 min for the NAP+forebrain vesicle culture and 36.0 ± 6.3 min for the NAP+hypothalamus culture) as those in cultures without brain tissues. It is concluded that pulsatile GnRH release is an inherent function of GnRH neurons. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - The neurohypophysial hormones oxytocin and vasopressin show daily rhythms of secretion with elevated hormone release during the hours of sleep. This pattern can be modulated by ovarian steroids and alters with age. The pattern appears to be due in part to the nocturnal increase in melatonin secretion, which stimulates hormone release in man, while being inhibitory in the rat. Pinealectomy alters both the 24 h pattern of neurohypophysial hormone release in the rat and the firing rate of magnocellular supraoptic nucleus neurones. There is also a reduced hormone release in response to hypovolaemia and raised plasma sodium concentration compared to sham operated animals, with a smaller increase in neuronal activity, as determined by immediate-early gene expression. The normal responses can be restored by nocturnal administration of melatonin. Melatonin also influences the neurohypophysial hormone response in the human to known stimuli of release, such as raised plasma osmolality, exercise and insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Recent studies have revealed that not only does the release of vasopressin and oxytocin vary over each 24 h, but the respective renal and pregnant uterine responses also show diurnal variations.

N2  - The primary aim was to determine whether there was an inverse association between the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the development of traits associated with asthma in children at age six years. A prospective cohort study of children from Western Australia was enrolled prior to birth and followed to age six. Two thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine children were recruited through antenatal clinics at the major tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth. Unconditional logistic regression was used to model the association between duration of exclusive breastfeeding and outcomes related to asthma or atopy at age six allowing for a number of important confounders. These included gender, gestational age, smoking in pregnancy and early child care. After adjustment for confounders, the introduction of milk other than breastmilk before four months of age was a significant (p < 0.05) risk factor for all asthma-related outcomes in six-year-old children: (i) doctor diagnosed asthma odds ratio ¿OR¿ = 1.25 (95% CI 1.02-1.54); (ii) wheeze three or more times since the age of one year OR 1.42 (1.15-1.76); (iii) wheeze in the last twelve months OR 1.28 (1.02-1.76); (iv) sleep disturbance due to wheeze within the last twelve months OR 1.41 (1.04-1.90); (v) age at doctor diagnosis (hazard ratio ¿HR¿ 1.22 ¿1.03-1.43¿); (vi) age at first wheeze (HR 1.36 ¿1.17-1.59¿) and; (vii) positive reaction to common aeroallergens OR 1.27 (1.01-1.59). There is a substantial reduction in risk of childhood asthma as assessed at age six years, if exclusive breastfeeding is continued for at least the first four months of life. These findings are important for our understanding of the aetiology of and for the potential prevention of asthma in children.

N2  - We examined the processes of cortical activation and deactivation of the fetal brain during spontaneous sleep state transitions and during central nervous processing of vibroacoustic stimulations (VASs) using nonlinear analysis of the electrocorticogram (ECoG). Tests of nonlinearity and a random shuffling routine revealed deterministic and nonlinear portions in the fetal ECoG. As common nonlinear measures are not applicable to nonstationary time series, we developed an algorithm to estimate the predictability of the ECoG in its time course by means of a point prediction error (PPE). The ECoG was recorded before and during VAS from the maternal abdominal surface in seven chronically instrumented fetal sheep at 0.8 of gestation. The PPE during REM sleep was significantly higher than during NREM sleep. VAS in NREM sleep resulted in an abrupt increase of the PPE not reaching the level of REM sleep. The steep increase of the PPE at onset and its slow decrease after cessation of the stimulus were very similar to the dynamics of spontaneous sleep state transitions, suggesting the involvement of the same cortical activating mechanisms. In conclusion, the stage and the time course of fetal brain activation and deactivation patterns can be clearly shown by PPE techniques. The PPE is a useful complement to spectral analysis. Both techniques describe different properties of the ECoG.

N2  - To determine the influence of maternal smoking on autonomic nervous system in healthy infants, 36 infants were recorded polygraphically for one night. Their mothers were defined, according to their smoking frequency during pregnancy, as 'nonsmokers' (no cigarettes smoked during pregnancy) or 'smokers' (10 or more cigarettes per day). The infants had a median postnatal age of 10.5 wk (range 6 to 16 wk); 18 were born to nonsmokers, and 18 to smokers. During the whole night, spectral analyses of heart rate (HR) were evaluated as a function of sleep stages. Two major peaks were recognizable: a low-frequency component (LF) related to sympathetic and parasympathetic activities and a high-frequency component (HF) reflecting parasympathetic tonus. The ratio of LF/HF powers was calculated as an index of sympathovagal interaction. In REM sleep, 'smokers' infants were characterized by significantly lower HF powers and normalized HF powers, and higher LF/HF ratios than 'nonsmokers'. The finding did not reach statistical significance in NREM sleep. In conclusion, maternal smoking induced changes in autonomic control and maturation in infants. These effects of cigarette smoke exposure can be added to those already reported and offer additional evidence for counseling mothers to stop smoking.

N2  - We have examined the effects of exposure to chronic maternal anemia, throughout the final one-third of gestation, on postnatal ventilatory and arousal responses to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and combined hypoxia-hypercapnia in sleeping lambs. While resting quietly awake, lambs from anemic ewes had higher arterial PCO2 levels than control animals during the first 2-3 postnatal wk, but pH, arterial PO2, and arterial O2 saturation were not different. During active and quiet sleep lambs from anemic ewes had higher end-tidal CO2 levels than control animals when breathing room air and at the time of spontaneous arousal or when aroused by progressive hypercapnia or by combined hypoxia-hypercapnia. Ventilation and arterial O2 saturation during uninterrupted sleep and ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia (inspiratory O2 fraction, 10%), progressive hypercapnia, and combined hypoxia/hypercapnia were not significantly affected by exposure to maternal anemia. Our findings show that maternal anemia results in elevated PCO2 levels in the offspring. This effect may be due, at least in part, to altered pulmonary function.

N2  - Study objective: Our purpose was to study the relationship between snoring and pregnancy-induced hypertension and growth retardation of the fetus. Design: Retrospective, cross-sectional, consecutive case series. Setting: The Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital, Umea, Sweden. Participants and measurements: On the day of delivery, 502 women with singleton pregnancies completed a questionnaire about snoring, witnessed sleep apneas, and daytime fatigue. Data concerning medical complications were taken from the women's casebooks. Results: During the last week of pregnancy, 23% of the women reported snoring every night. Only 4% reported snoring before becoming pregnant. Hypertension developed in 14% of snoring women, compared with 6% of nonsnorers (p < 0.01). Preeclampsia occurred in 10% of snorers, compared with 4% of nonsnorers (p < 0.05). An Apgar score ≤ 7 was more common in infants born to habitual snorers. Growth retardation of the fetus, defined as small for gestational age at birth, had occurred in 7.1% of the infants of snoring mothers and 2.6% of the remaining infants (p < 0.05). Habitual snoring was independently predictive of hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 2.03; p < 0.05) and growth retardation (OR, 3.45; p < 0.01) in a logistic regression analysis controlling for weight, age, and smoking. Conclusions: Snoring is common in pregnancy and is a sign of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Snoring indicates a risk of growth retardation of the fetus.

N2  - Objective: To describe changes in women's sleep patterns from prepregnancy to postpartum.Methods: Polysomnography was done in women's homes for 2 consecutive nights. Forty-five women were studied during the follicular and luteal phases of their menstrual cycles, and 33 conceived and were studied during each trimester of pregnancy. Twenty-nine were studied at 1 and 3 months postpartum.Results: Compared with prepregnant sleep characteristics, significant changes in sleep patterns were evident by 11-12 weeks' gestation, with a significant increase in total sleep time but less deep sleep and more awakening during sleep. By the third month postpartum, there was improvement in sleep characteristics; however, sleep efficiency remained significantly lower than baseline prepregnancy values.Conclusion: Sleep disturbance was greatest during the first postpartum month, particularly for first-time mothers.

N2  - During pregnancy, placenta-derived CRH increases exponentially in the plasma. Circulating levels of CRH-binding protein decrease considerably in the last trimester of pregnancy, resulting in further elevation of bioavailable plasma CRH. The adrenal glands during pregnancy gradually become hypertrophic because of the increase in ACTH, which parallels that of CRH. Thus, pregnancy is a transient period of relative hypercortisolism. The activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during pregnancy has been proposed to function as a biological clock. In this model, the placenta is perceived as a stress-sensitive organ and placental CRH as a timing starter, determining a preterm, term, or postterm labor. During pregnancy, as well as during the immediate postpartum period, the hypothalamic maternal CRH secretion is suppressed, because of the circulating levels of cortisol. Hypothalamic CRH secretion normalizes within 12 weeks. This transient postpartum maternal hypothalamic CRH suppression, together with the steroid withdrawal that follows parturition, might be causally related to the mood disorders and the vulnerability to autoimmune diseases such as thyroiditis or rheumatoid arthritis often observed during the postpartum period.

N2  - Objective. Little is known about the neurophysiologic effects of prenatal cocaine/crack use. The aim of this study, designed to overcome methodologic limitations of previous research, was to investigate the effects of prenatal cocaine use on electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep patterns, a marker of central nervous system development. Methods. In a longitudinal study of prenatal cocaine/crack exposure, women were interviewed at the end of each trimester about cocaine, crack, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use. Two-hour paper- and computer-generated EEG sleep recordings were obtained on a sample of the full-term infants on the second day of life and at 1 year postpartum. Eligible newborns were fullterm, had received no general anesthesia, and had a 5-minute Apgar score >5. All infants whose mothers used one or more lines of cocaine during their first trimester or any crack (n = 37) were selected. A comparison group was chosen randomly from the group of women who did not use cocaine or crack during their pregnancy (n = 34). Results. Women who used cocaine/crack during the first trimester were older, less educated, less likely to be working, and used more tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs than women who did not use cocaine/crack during the first trimester. There were no differences in infant birth weight, length, head circumference, or gestational age between the two exposure groups. After controlling for the significant covariates, prenatal cocaine exposure was associated with less well developed spectral correlations between homologous brain regions at birth, and with lower spectral EEG power values at 1 year of age. Prenatal alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use were found to affect state regulation and cortical activities. Conclusions. These results indicate that the neurotoxic effects of prenatal cocaine/crack use can be detected with quantitative EEG measures.

N2  - Objective: The gastrointestinal motility agents metoclopramide and domperidone are known to increase pituitary prolactin (PRL) secretion and breast milk production. This study compared the effect of single doses of two strengths of metoclopramide and a single dose of domperidone on PRL secretion. Methods: Ten nonpregnant women had baseline evaluation of serum PRL concentrations. The PRL concentrations were then determined after random oral administration of metoclopramide 10 mg, metoclopramide 5 mg, and domperidone 10 mg. Blood samples were drawn in the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle, at 13 time points over a 6-hour period (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes), with the zero time point beginning at 0800 hours. Variables such as weight, height, age, gravidity, parity, and oral contraceptive use were recorded. Results: Baseline PRL concentrations showed the natural circadian rhythm. Metoclopramide and domperidone both caused a significant increase in PRL. However, PRL secretion was most influenced by parity. Nulliparous women had the quickest and highest PRL secretion with metoclopramide 10 mg, compared with the PRL response with metoclopramide 5 mg and domperidone 10 mg. Conversely, multiparous women had PRL secretion patterns that were equivalent between the medications. Conclusions: The PRL response to the medications was most influenced by parity. Therefore, we suggest that the medication therapy of choice for enhancing lactation may not be the same in all women, but may instead be determined by parity.

N2  - This study eval uated the impact of certain Emergency Physician (EP) conditions on hiring decisions by fellow EPs. An anonymous survey asked 255 Pennsylvania EPs to rate the likelihood of their voting to offer a position in each of six scenarios. Three scenarios consisted of EPs unable to work regular shifts because of periodic migraines, a sleep disorder, and periodic difficulty handling stress. The other scenarios involved an EP with a probable future pregnancy, a recovered alcoholic, and a healthy HIV-positive physician. Most respondents said they were unlikely to recommend hiring colleagues who disclose a disorder restricting their availability for regular shifts. EPs were generally tolerant of recovered alcoholics and plans for pregnancy leave, but nearly half had significant reservations regarding hiring HIV-positive peers. An understanding of which conditions negatively impact an EP's ability to obtain employment in Emergency Medicine may be useful in emergency medicine career counseling or in the process of obtaining disability coverage.

N2  - Objective: To determine if any relationship exists between the severity of symptoms in women with dystonia and female reproductive hormonal variations. Patients and Methods: We surveyed 279 women with dystonia seen at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale over a 6-year period (1990-1995), and 204 responded. The women were asked questions regarding their reproductive and menstrual histories and dystonia severity and other questions with an emphasis on possible exacerbating or relieving factors. Results: Although in the majority of women hormonal influences had no consistent effect on dystonia symptom severity, 26 (41.9%) of 62 premenopausal women noted a change in the severity of their dystonic symptoms in relation to the 3 phases of their menstrual cycle. Other factors that exacerbated dystonia included stress and fatigue, while sleep improved symptoms. Pregnancy, menopause, and hormone replacement therapy had no effect on symptoms. Conclusions: Menstrual cycling may result in subjective worsening of dystonia symptoms in some women with dystonia. Further clinical and physiologic evaluation is indicated in such patients, as they may represent an important subgroup of dystonic patients that might yield some clues to the pathophysiology of dystonia and to improved treatment strategies.

N2  - Purpose: To elucidate further the maturation of voiding habits from gestation to infancy we investigated the free voiding pattern of healthy preterm neonates. Materials and Methods: We evaluated 11 male and 8 female healthy preterm newborns at a mean of 32 weeks after cessation of menstrual flow (postmenstrual age). Assessment was done in the neonatal ward using 4- hour voiding observation, a method described previously in studies of free voiding pattern of full-term newborns. Results: The voiding pattern of male and female preterm neonates was characterized by 1 void per hour and a mean voided volume of 53% of bladder capacity with 58% frequency of interrupted voiding. Residual urine was increased but varied during observation (mean 11% bladder capacity) and was 0 after at least 1 void during 4 hours in 14 of the 19 subjects. Two-thirds of all voiding occurred during sleep, whereas a third of the newborns showed signs of arousal with a mean awake time of only 17 minutes. Conclusions: The voiding pattern of preterm versus full-term subjects is characterized by an increased number of interrupted voidings, further indicating that these voidings represent immature behavior of detrusor-sphincter coordination. Also, the high number of voidings during sleep suggest a more immature pattern for preterm newborns.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol can produce a number of behavioral alterations, including hyperactivity, learning deficits and motor impairments. However, the severity and nature of behavioral alterations varies markedly among children of women who drink during pregnancy. One important determinant of this variation may be genetic differences in the response to alcohol. Recently, we demonstrated that exposure to alcohol during development produced hyperactivity in rats bred for high alcohol sensitivity (HAS), but not in rats bred for low alcohol sensitivity (LAS). These lines were selectively bred for extremes in alcohol-induced 'sleep time.' The present study investigated the effects of ethanol exposure during development on motor coordination later in life in both HAS and LAS rats. Using an artificial rearing procedure, neonatal pups from each line were exposed to a binge-like alcohol treatment on postnatal days (PD) 4-9. Within each line, one group was exposed to ethanol (6.0 g/kg/day), one group served as an artificially reared control, and a third served as a normally reared control group. On PD 30, parallel bar motor performance was evaluated. Exposure to ethanol during development severely impaired motor performance in the HAS rats compared to their controls. In LAS rats, early ethanol exposure produced only mild and nonsignificant effects on motor performance. Thus, HAS rats were more vulnerable to ethanol-induced motor deficits compared to the LAS rats. Importantly, there were no differences in peak blood alcohol level between the lines, indicating that vulnerability to ethanol's teratogenic effects was not due to differences in metabolic rate. These results suggest that genetic differences in response to alcohol may serve as a predictor for susceptibility to ethanol's teratogenic effects. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - We report 5 girls presenting Rett syndrome. All of them were from south Tunisia. They fulfilled the Rett syndrome diagnosis criteria (The Rett syndrome diagnosis criteria work group, 1988). Pregnancy, birth and psychomotor development during the first year of live were normal. The mean age at the onset was 19.8±2.5 months. The two revealing symptoms were psychomotor regression (3 cases) and epilepsy (2 cases). They were admitted to our ward at a mean age of 4.7±1.5 years. Clinical presentation was typical of Rett syndrome. Mental retardation, stereotypic hand movement (hand washing/wringing or clapping/tapping) and loss of purposeful manual skills were noted in all cases. Gait was apraxic and increase of head circumference was slowed. Additional features included: respiratory dysfunction (episodic hyperventilation and breath-holding), epilepsy, scoliosis (4 cases), growth retardation and spasticity (3 cases). Electroencephalography showed slow activity with multifocal epileptiform abnormalities. Sleep enhanced these EEG abnormalities. MRI and CT-scan disclosed non specific cortical and sub- cortical atrophy. All cases were isolated and parents were consanguineous in 3 cases. Rett syndrome is relatively frequent in Europe, but in Tunisia this disease remains rare and certainly underdiagnosed.

N2  - The circadian rhythm of arterial pressure (AP) is not a passive consequence of the impact of exogenous factors. Endogenous mechanisms play an important role in the generation and maintenance of AP rhythm. The adaptation of the exogenous components of AP rhythm to the demands of the environment is modulated by the circadian-time-dependent responsiveness of the biologic oscillator. A neuronal network in the rostral hypothalamus including the suprachiasmatic nucleus is implicated in the generation of AP rhythm, in the modification of the rhythm amplitude (possibly due to homeostatic constraints), and in the regulation of its phase. The central sympathoexcitatory pathway to the upper thoracic cord plays a crucial role in the maintenance of normal circadian AP rhythm. The circadian pattern of AP is influenced also by hormonal factors such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axes, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, opioids, and various vasoactive peptides. The circadian variations of AP depend on physiological state--sleep and wakefulness, pregnancy, work, and senescence (primary aging). In some essential hypertensive patients and in patients with secondary hypertension the nocturnal fall in AP is reduced or absent (nondippers). Target-organ damage is more advanced in nondippers than in dippers. The occurrence of cardiovascular events exhibits a prominent circadian pattern, with events more frequent in the morning (06:00-12:00 h).

N2  - Frequently in pregnancy itch is responsible of itching lesions, sleep disorders and anxiety for the mother and the obstetrician. Every single itching case needs a clinical and laboratory study, even if no many itching cases give mathernal and fetus complications. Some clinical cases were observed by us, giving the opportunity to value the itch desease in pregnancy; the most usefull classification is: 1) Pruritus gravidarum, or intraepatic cholestasis in pregnancy (PG). 2) Herpes gestationis (HG). 3) Bollous and itching dermatoses of pregnancy (DPPG). The purpose of our study is to give a small review of itch lesions in pregnancy to gynaecologists, with diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of the common itch diseases.

N2  - Seasonal infertility in sows is a problem in the pig industry characterized by delayed onset of puberty in summer and decreased farrowing rate resulting from silent oestrus and aborted pregnancy. Summer infertility is thought to be influenced by heat, sunburn and stress. However, the strongest contributory factor is photoperiod. The difference in seasonality between wild boar and commercial pig breeds suggests that there may be a genetic component to this trait. The maps and associated molecular tools emerging from the pig genome project have created opportunities to examine the genetic component of seasonal infertility. We are identifying and mapping genes that are likely to be involved in biological clock mechanisms and the melatonin pathways as candidate seasonality genes.

N2  - Objective: Sudden infant death syndrome has been related to both exposure to prenatal cigarette smoke and impaired arousability from sleep. We evaluated whether healthy infants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy had higher auditory arousal thresholds than those born to mothers who did not smoke and whether the effects of smoking occurred before birth. Study design: Twenty-six newborns were studied with polygraphic recordings for 1 night: 13 were born to mothers who did not smoke, and 13 were born to mothers who smoked (>9 cigarettes per day). Other infants with a median postnatal age of 12 weeks were also studied, 21 born to nonsmoking mothers and 21 born to smoking mothers. White noise of increasing intensity was administered during rapid eye movement sleep to evaluate arousal and awakening thresholds. Results: More intense auditory stimuli were needed to induce arousals in newborns (P = .002) and infants (P = .044) of smokers than in infants of nonsmokers. Behavioral awakening occurred significantly less frequently in the newborns of smokers (P = .002) than of nonsmokers. Conclusions: Newborns and infants born to smoking mothers had higher arousal thresholds to auditory challenges than those born to nonsmoking mothers. The impact of exposure to cigarette smoke occurred before birth.

N2  - COMT O-methylates catecholamines and other compounds with a catechol structure. The general function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active or toxic catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. During the first trimester of pregnancy, COMT present in the placenta protects the developing embryo from activated hydroxylated compounds. COMT also acts as an enzymatic detoxicating barrier between the blood and other tissues shielding against the detrimental effects of xenobiotics. COMT may serve some unique or indirect functions in the kidney and intestine tract by modulating the dopaminergic tone; the same may be true in the brain: COMT activity may regulate the amounts of active dopamine and norepinephrine in various part of the brain and therefore be associated with the mood and other mental processes. There is one single gene for COMT, which codes for both S-COMT and MB-COMT using two separate promoters. Both rat and human S-COMTs contain 221 amino acids, and their molecular weights are 24.8 and 24.4 kD, respectively. Rat MB-COMT contains 43 and human MB-COMT contains 50 additional amino acids, of which 17 (rat) and 20 (human) are hydrophobic membrane anchors. The remainder of the MB-COMT molecule is suspended on the cytoplasmic side of the intracellular membranes. Rat S-COMT has been recently crystallized at 1.7- to 20-Å resolution. The active site of COMT consists of the AdoMet-binding domain and the actual catalytic site. The catalytic site is formed by a few amino acids that are important for the binding of the substrate, water, and Mg2+ and for the catalysis of O-methylation. The Mg2+, which is bound to COMT only after AdoMet binding, improves the ionization of the hydroxyl groups. The lysine residue (Lys144), which accepts the proton of one of the hydroxyls, acts as a general catalytic base in the nucleophilic methyl transfer reaction. A series of new and highly selective COMT inhibitors have been developed. Entacapone, nitecapone, and tolcapone are nitrocatechol-type potent COMT inhibitors in vitro (K(i) in nanomolar range), whereas CGP 28014 is a hydroxypyridine derivative and ineffective in vitro. In animal studies, these compounds effectively inhibit the O-methylation of L-dopa, thus improving its bioavailability and brain penetration and potentiating its behavioral effects. Entacapone and nitecapone have mainly a peripheral effect, whereas tolcapone and CGP 28014 also inhibit the O-methylation in the brain. In human volunteers, entacapone, nitecapone, and tolcapone dose- dependently inhibit the COMT activity of erythrocytes, improve the bioavailability of L-dopa, and inhibit the formation of 3-OMD. In clinical studies in PD patients, both entacapone and tolcapone potentiate the therapeutic effect of L-dopa and prolong the daily on time by 1 to 2 h. The two marketed COMT inhibitors have different treatment strategies, advantages, and disadvantages, which are listed in Table 11. In the clinic, COMT inhibitors have been well tolerated, and the number of premature terminations has been low. In general, the incidence of adverse events has been higher in tolcapone-treated patients than in entacapone-treated patients. The main events have consisted of dopaminergic and gastrointestinal problems. Dopaminergic overactivity causes an initial worsening of levodopa-induced dyskinesia, nausea, vomiting, orthostatic hypotension, sleep disorders, and hallucinations. Tolcapone has been associated with diarrhea in about 16 to 18% of cases, and entacapone has been associated in less than 10% of cases. Diarrhea has led to discontinuation in 5 to 6% of patients treated with tolcapone and in 2.5% of those treated with entacapone. Urine discoloration to dark yellow or orange is related to the color of COMT inhibitors and their metabolites. Elevated liver transaminate levels are reported in 1 to 3% of patients treated with tolcapone but very rarely, if at all, in patients treated with entacapone. Three cases of acute, fatal fulminant hepatitis have been described in association of tolcapone when more than 100,000 patients have been treated. In addition, a few potentially fatal neurological adverse reactions, including neuroleptic-like malignant syndrome, have described. Because of these serious adverse drug reactions, tolcapone marketing was suspended in Europe and Canada. In early 1999, no restrictions of the use of entacapone have been proposed.

N2  - These are the first clinical guidelines published for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD) providing evidence-based practice parameters. They were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The guidelines provide recommendations for the practice of sleep medicine in North America regarding the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Recommendations are based on the accompanying comprehensive review of the medical literature regarding treatment of RLS and PLMD which was developed by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Recommendations are identified as standards, guidelines, or options, based on the strength of evidence from published studies that meet criteria for inclusion. Dopaminergic agents are the best studied and most successful agents for treatment of RLS and PLMD. Specific recommendations are also given for the use of opioid, benzodiazepine, anticonvulsant, and adrenergic medications, and for iron supplementation. In general, pharmacological treatment should be limited to individuals who meet diagnostic criteria and especially who experience insomnia and/or excessive sleepiness that is thought to occur secondary to RLS or PLMD. Individuals treated with medication should be followed by a physician and monitored for clinical response and adverse effects. It would be desirable for future investigations to employ multicenter clinical trials, with expanded numbers of subjects using double-blind, placebo-controlled designs, and an assessment of long-term response, side effects, and impact of treatment on quality of life. Evaluation of special groups such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly is warranted.

N2  - A 26 yr old puerperal female with Hallermann-Streiff syndrome developed serious obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome during pregnancy. She underwent an elective Caesarean section delivery, but ending the pregnancy did not improve her clinical symptoms. By treating her with nasal continuous positive airway pressure, a worsening of her headaches and glaucoma was prevented. The administration of acetazolamide controlled all of her symptoms. Treatment with nasal ventilation is the best initial approach. It is also important to assure normal oxygenation before pregnancy since the foetus may suffer from the severe deprivation that may occur in these patients.

N2  - Sleep disturbance is a complaint of childbearing women that has implications for perinatal health. A descriptive, longitudinal study examined the numbers and sources of midsleep awakenings in women prior to conception and during each trimester of pregnancy. A secondary analysis of data from a larger study of sleep during childbearing was performed for subjects (n = 25) who completed sleep diaries across the four measurement periods. There was a two-fold increase in the number of awakenings from pre-conception to the third trimester of pregnancy. Maintenance insomnia during pregnancy follows a pattern of prevalence that can be characterized by trimester. The predominant source of awakening during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy was due to the need to urinate. Parity and environmental circumstances can influence sources of awakenings. Nurses working with childbearing women can provide information and assistance with strategies to minimize or mitigate lengthy episodes of sleep disturbance.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of psychosocial and demographic variables to health behaviors in early pregnancy. DESIGN: First trimester findings presented from a prospective study of weight gain in pregnancy. SETTING: A comprehensive health care system in central Texas. PARTICIPANTS: 114 pregnant women (75% white, 13% African American, 10% Hispanic, 2% Asian) of 12 weeks gestation or less. OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-Care Inventory, which includes diet/eating, substance abuse, recklessness, hygiene-related practices, sleep/rest, and exercise behaviors. RESULTS: In regression analysis the final model of demographic and psychosocial variables showed that higher depressive symptoms, lower internal locus of control for fetal health, and lower family income were related to poorer health behaviors in the 1st trimester of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Health behaviors in early pregnancy may be affected by psychosocial factors such as depressive symptoms. Greater emphasis should be given to such factors in research and prenatal assessments.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare health and lifestyle factors of people with and without urinary incontinence (UI). DESIGN: A postal survey was undertaken that represents the first of a 3-stage project designed to evaluate the health interventions of primary health care teams and continence advisory services on patient outcomes related to UI. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Two random samples of adult populations (N = 12,529) were included, generated from the family physician patient registers within 2 health authorities in England. INSTRUMENTS: Data were collected using a structured questionnaire that queried demography, perceived health status, activities of daily living, self-care, and use of local health and social services. Information was also collected on past and present continence status. METHODS: Structured questionnaires and a cover letter were mailed to the target population. Two reminders were sent to nonresponders to maximize the response rate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main measures relate to factors associated with UI: mobility, sleep, childbirth, smoking, diet, body mass index, and accommodation. RESULTS: Significantly more women than men had UI (P < .0001). Respondents with UI were older than those who were continent (P < .0001). Women with UI were significantly more likely to have a greater number of pregnancies (P < .0001), were more likely to have given birth to a baby weighing more than 9 lb (P < .01), and to have had more than 4 children (P = .01) compared with women who were continent. People with UI were less likely to be single and more likely to be widowed than those who were continent (P < .0001). People who lived alone and who had UI were also significantly less likely to have a relative or friend that they could depend on for help than those who were continent (P < .001). UI was also found to be significantly associated with impaired mobility (P < .0001) and sleeping difficulties (P < .0001). No meaningful differences were found between diet and UI, although significantly more people with UI had higher mean body mass index, were obese, or reported that they felt too heavy for their height when compared with people who were continent (P < .0001). No association was found in the present study with smoking or ethnicity and UI. CONCLUSIONS: Key health and lifestyle factors associated with UI included age, gender, childbirth, mobility, sleep patterns, obesity, living alone, and access to help. These factors should be assessed when planning and implementing health care for persons with UI. Attention to these associated factors may prove useful in identifying new cases or people at risk of developing UI when screening people as part of routine health checks. This, in turn, could assist with targeting effective and efficient health care but may also contribute to prevention for some people.

N2  - Background. - This case-control prospective study was conducted to determine whether and how medical, psychological and affective development differs from premature to full-term newborns without severe disability. Population and methods. - Newborns under or at 33 weeks gestation (W) were included from December 1992 to January 1994 and were matched with two controls. The same examiners evaluated each infant at the effective postnatal age of nine to ten months. Results. - Fifty premature babies (average gestational age [GA] = 30.7 W) were compared to 100 controls. The main problems were bronchopulmonary (P = 0.03) and sleep (P = 0.027) disorders. Motor disability was suspected in 9% of the cases and none control (P = 0.00003, OR = 3,44). By multivariate analysis, cases differed from the controls by infant-mother relation disturbances (OR = 13.3), motherhood anxiety (OR = 13.3) poor expressiveness (OR = 5.6), peripheral tonus anomalies (OR = 39.5) and sleep troubles (OR = 5.8). Conclusion. - Premature newborns had risks for the child-mother relation but not for psychoaffective development disturbances.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the fertility data in Aragón, Spain. METHODS: A survey was conducted in several companies during 1997 and 1998. Participation in the survey was optional, participants were not identified and a table of random figures was utilized. Error 2 +/- 2.98, 95% confidence interval, P = Q = 50%. RESULTS: 139 employees participated in the survey; 94% were male, 6.4% were single, 87.7% married, 5.7% had a stable partner, 12.3% had higher level, 53.6% medium and 34% elementary level education. Mean number of children per couple was 1.7 and mean number of children desired was 1.9. Mean time from decision to have children to pregnancy was 4.5 months. Mean age at conception of the first child was 28 years for the men and 25 years for the women. One of the partners was employed in 42.7% of the cases. Mean working hours was 8.3 and mean number of years in the same job was 14.5. Twenty-one percent considered they were exposed to toxic substances. Mean hours of sleep was 6 hours, 35% took warm baths and 24.4% used tight-fitting underclothes. Ninety percent drank alcohol and/or coffee mild to moderately and 50% were smokers. No significant differences were found in the number of children according to level of education, type of work or if one of the partners or both were employed. A clearly negative correlation was found between the year of birth and the number of children desired. CONCLUSION: In Aragón, the birthrate trend remains low and does not appear to be influenced by the economic level, life style, type of job or whether or not both partners are employed.

N2  - Objective. Preliminary reports suggest that antenatal steroid administration may confound the assessment of fetal well-being by suppressing biophysical activities, consequently drug-induced effects could prompt unwarranted delivery of premature fetuses. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of antenatal betamethasone administration on fetal biophysical activities and Doppler flow indices of the umbilical and middle cerebral circulation. Methods. Forty women at risk of premature delivery between 27-32 weeks gestation (mean 30.2 weeks) received two consecutive doses of intramuscular betamethasone, 24 hours apart. Ultrasonographic observations of fetal behavior for 30 minute periods and Doppler examination of the umbilical and cerebral arteries were performed prior to (0 hours), 48 hours after, and 96 hours after administration of the first dose. To account for fetal circadian rhythms and maternal prandial status, all examinations were carefully timed and performed between 1-4 pm. Analysis of Variance, chi-square test and Fisher's Exact test were used for statistical analysis, as appropriate. Results. Nine patients were excluded from analysis due to delivery prior to completion of all examinations. Number of breathing episodes as well as total breathing time at 48 hours decreased by 83.0% (p < 0.01) and 90.4% (p < 0.01), respectively, at 48 hours in comparison to baseline. Fetal limb and trunk movements decreased by 53.2% (p < 0.01) and 48.6% p < 0.01), respectively. Amniotic fluid volume and fetal tone were normal in all patients. At 48 hours, 14 of 31 fetuses and 4 of 31 fetuses had a biophysical profile score of 6/8 and 4/8, respectively, in comparison to 0 of 31 and 0 of 31 at 0 hours (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). All parameters returned to baseline values at 96 h. Pulsatility indices of umbilical and middle cerebral arteries remained unchanged at 48 hours and 96 hours (p = NS). Conclusions. Betamethasone induces a profound, albeit transient, suppression of fetal breathing, limb and trunk movements, resulting in decreased biophysical profile scores. Awareness of this drug-induced effect might prevent unnecessary iatrogenic delivery of preterm fetuses.

N2  - Objective. To examine whether ethnic origin is related to care giving styles relevant to sudden infant death. Design. Prospective/retrospective, descriptive. Method. In six child health care centres in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, data about sleep position, bedclothes and passive smoking of infants aged 1-5 months were collected by face-to-face interviews of mothers visiting these centres between February 1997 and October 1998. Results. Eligible for the study were 1815 infants, 919 boys and 896 girls, mean age 2 months. In Amsterdam 12.5% of infants were usually or sometimes put to sleep in a prone position, 31.0% usually or now and then in a side position (but not in a prone position) and 56.5% usually in a supine position. Prone sleeping position was more frequent among Surinamese infants and less frequent among Moroccan infants compared with Dutch infants. Overall use of a duvet among infants was 22.7%. Use of duvets was higher among allochtonous infants; after controlling for demographic factors this difference was not significant, however. 6.3% of the infants had slept in the previous night with a pillow. Use of a pillow was much more frequent among allochtonous than among autochthonous infants: 13% versus 1.2%. Maternal daily smoking during pregnancy and daily smoking by mothers or others at home at time of interview was found in 15.1% and 25.8% of the infants respectively. Almost no Moroccan mothers smoked during pregnancy (0.4%), while Turkish mothers smoked as much as Dutch mothers (18.5% and 21.6% respectively). No differences in daily smoking at home were found between Surinamese, Moroccan and Dutch families (circa 26%). However, daily smoking at home was much more frequent in Turkish families (43.8%). Conclusion. Health education about a safe sleeping position, about safe bedclothes and about the dangers of passive smoking is still needed. Education programmes to prevent sudden infant death must take into account ethnic differences in care giving styles. Special attention must be paid to the use of a pillow among allochtonous infants.

N2  - Ultrasound examination offered to nearly all pregnant women in Norway may lead to the identification of fetuses with Down's syndrome. This may lead to termination of pregnancies and to a reduction in the prevalence of live-borns with Down's syndrome. In a retrospective study of hospital records we have examined the prevalence of Down's syndrome, associated malformations and diseases during the last 20 years. 68 children and adolescents with Down's syndrome were identified. 43 were born 1988-97 (1.16 per 1,000 births) and 25 1978-87 (0.8 per 1,000 births; p = 0.13). Congenital heart defects were diagnosed in 33 children (49%). Five children (7.4%) had died by the end of 1997, four with a cardiovascular defect. Four children had moved out of the region. Among 59 persons alive at the time of study, 11 (19%) were treated for hypothyroidism, 26 (44%) had been hospitalised because of infections, and 14 (20%) suffered from problems with sleep obstruction. 23 (39%) had impairments in hearing and 30 (51%) in vision. Ten children (18%) had a weight-for-height above the 97.5 percentile of standard growth charts for Norwegian children. Serum concentration of zink was below reference values in 15 children. We conclude that the prevalence of livebirths with Down's syndrome was not reduced in 1988-97 compared to 1978-87. Children with Down's syndrome have a wide range of somatic disorders and need close and systematic medical follow-up.

N2  - We report on a boy with a maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 (UPD(14)). At 7 years of age he was referred to us by the paediatrician because of symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). He showed short stature, obesity, mild developmental delay, cryptorchidism, and some mild dysmorphic features. The history further indicated intrauterine growth retardation at the end of the pregnancy. His mother was 44 years of age at the time of his birth. After birth he showed hypotonia with poor sucking, for which gavage feeding was needed. Motor development was delayed. After 1 year he became obese despite a normal appetite. Recurrent middle ear infections, a high pain threshold, and a great skill with jigsaw puzzles were reported. There were no behavioural problems or sleep disturbance. Chromosomal analysis was normal (46,XY). DNA analysis for Prader-Willi syndrome showed no abnormalities. Two years later he was re-examined because we thought his features fitted the PWS-like phenotype associated with maternal UPD(14). At that time precocious puberty was evident. DNA analysis showed maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14. In all the previously described 11 cases with maternal UPD(14), a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 was detected cytogenetically before DNA analysis. This is the first report of diagnosis of maternal UPD(14) based on clinical features. This finding underlines the importance of DNA analysis for maternal UPD(14) in patients with a similar PWS-like phenotype even without previous identification of a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14.

N2  - This study tested the hypothesis that the uterus achieves maximum contractile capabilities before the onset of labor. Basal and agonist- stimulated contractions were assessed in uterine strips on Day 15 or 18 of pregnancy, the day of parturition, or I day postpartum (n = 4-13 per group). Spontaneous contractions were evident in all groups (n = 4-13 per gestational group); contraction frequency was greater in peripartum groups than in virgin controls (~4.6 versus 2.8/200 sec). Peak amplitude was nearly 9-fold higher on Days 15 and 18 and over 30-fold higher in the postpartum and I day postpartum groups than in nonpregnant mice. Maximum frequency and peak amplitude were achieved in response to 10-6 to 10-8 M oxytocin or arginine vasopressin (OT(max) or AVP(max). Frequency of contractions in response to OT(max) peaked on Day 18 and then declined. Contraction amplitude increased 5-fold on Day 15, declined on the day of birth (equivalent to nonpregnant level), then rebounded to peak on postpartum Day 1. AVP(max) similarly increased frequency and amplitude of contractions, except that maximum contraction amplitude occurred postpartum. Thus, an endogenous oscillator, residing in the uterus, sustains high basal and agonist-induced contraction frequency during pregnancy. Although acceleration of this pacemaker occurred before term, the data suggest that peripartum increases in contraction amplitude characterize the transition to the powerful synchronous contractions of parturition.

N2  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is one of the leading causes of postneonatal mortality in the United States. To reduce the risk for SIDS, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all healthy babies be placed to sleep on their backs. In 1994, a national "Back-to-Sleep" education campaign was begun to encourage health-care providers and the public to adopt a back or side sleeping position for all infants. To assess the response to these recommendations, CDC analyzed population-based data on infant sleeping positions during 1996 and 1997 from 13 states participating in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis and indicates that from 1996 to 1997 placement of infants in the stomach sleeping position declined significantly in four states and placement of infants in the back sleeping position increased significantly in nine states. However, the percentage of infants placed on their stomachs continued to differ by state, maternal demographics, and type of insurance coverage.

N2  - This study, using an information processing model of memory, made a detailed examination of the possible locus (loci) of any memory change in gravid and postpartum women using a battery of seven objective memory tests: implicit, incidental, explicit, semantic, short-term, working, and prospective memory. In addition, links were sought both between (a) self-reported data on sleep, health, and memory performance, and (b) these variables and objective memory perfomance. Five groups of women were tested (n = 22/23 per group), (1) primigravid, (2) multigravid, (3) postpartum, (4) non-pregnant parents with children, and (5) never been pregnant, on self-report and objective memory tests. The gravid and postpartum groups reported significantly more everyday forgetting than the non-pregnant groups but on the objective tests performed no differently from the non-pregnant groups on all tests. Sleep loss was a significant predictor of reported memory change, but not of any memory test performance, and may contribute to a perceived memory change. Pregnant women and new mothers generally should be confident of performing to their normal cognitive capabilities, but may be more affected than usual by a high cognitive load.

N2  - Ten pregnant Sprague Dawley rat dams were exposed to spaceflight aboard the Space Shuttle (STS-70) for gestational days 11-20 (G 11-20; FLT group). Control dams were maintained in either a flight-like (FDS group) or vivarium cage environment (VIV group) on earth. All dams had ad lib access to food and water and were exposed to a light-dark cycle consisting of 12 hours of light (approximately 30 lux) followed by 12 hours of darkness. The dams were closely monitored from G 22 until parturition. All pups were cross-fostered at birth; each foster dam had a litter of 10 pups. Pups remained with their foster dam until post natal day 21 (PN 21). Pup body mass was measured twice weekly. At PN 14 FLT pups had a smaller body mass than did the VIV pups (p < 0.01). Circadian rhythms of body temperature and activity of pups from two FLT dams (n = 8), two FDS dams (n = 9) and two VIV dams (n = 7) were studied starting from age PN 21. All pups had circadian rhythms of temperature and activity at this age. There were no significant differences in rhythms between groups that could be attributed to microgravity exposure. These results indicate that exposure to the microgravity environment of spaceflight during this embryonic development period does not affect the development of the circadian rhythms of body temperature and activity.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) has been described infrequently in adults, and treatment in both children and adults remains unsatisfactory. We report clinical features of a group of adults with CVS and anecdotal outcome from open-label treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, medications that have some efficacy in other unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: Clinical data were examined from 17 adult patients with CVS seen over a 10-yr period, each having been treated with a tricyclic antidepressant. Outpatient records were reviewed, clinical outcome was extracted using a priori criteria, and findings were compared with 37 patients having usual functional nausea and vomiting who also received tricyclic antidepressant therapy. RESULTS: Symptoms in CVS began at age 35 yr (range 14-73 yr); the average episode length was 6 days (range 1-21 days) and the symptom-free interval averaged 3.1 months (range 0.5-6 months). Vomiting cycles typically began without warning, and fewer than one-third of the subjects reported a prodrome or potential trigger event, such as menstrual periods, pregnancy, or large meals. Sleep was seemingly beneficial in 23.5%. Tricyclic antidepressant therapy was associated with complete remission in 17.6% and partial response in 58.8%, but was less effective than for functional nausea and vomiting (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: CVS is a rare diagnosis with distinctive features in adults. Duration of episodes and cycles varies considerably across subjects. In open-label, uncontrolled use, tricyclic antidepressants appear beneficial for some subjects but are less effective in CVS than in chronic, persistent functional nausea and vomiting.

N2  - The discovery of the adipocyte-produced hormone leptin has greatly changed the field of obesity research and our understanding of energy homeostasis. It is now accepted that leptin is the afferent loop informing the hypothalamus about the state of fat stores, with hypothalamic efferents regulating appetite and energy expenditure. In addition, leptin has a role as a metabolic adaptator in overweight and fasting states. New and previously unsuspected neuroendocrine roles have emerged for leptin. In reproduction, leptin is implicated in fertility regulation, and it is a permissive factor for puberty. Relevant gender-based differences in leptin levels exist, with higher levels in women at birth, which persist throughout life. In adult life, there is experimental evidence that leptin is a permissive factor for the ovarian cycle, with a regulatory role exerted at the hypothalamic, pituitary, and gonadal levels, and with unexplained changes in pregnancy and postpartum. Leptin is present in human milk and may play a role in the adaptive responses of the newborn. Leptin plays a role in the neuroendocrine control of GH secretion, through a complex interaction at hypothalamic levels with GHRH and somatostatin. Leptin participates in the expression of CRH in the hypothalamus, interacts at the adrenal level with ACTH, and is regulated by glucocorticoids. Since leptin and cortisol show an inverse circadian rhythm, it has been suggested that a regulatory feedback is present. Finally, regulatory actions on TRH-TSH and PRL secretion have been found. Thus leptin reports the state of fat stores to the hypothalamus and other neuroendocrine areas, and the neuroendocrine systems adapt their function to the current status of energy homeostasis and fat stores.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To establish whether epidemiologic characteristics for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) have changed since the decrease in death rate after the "Back to Sleep" campaign in 1991, and to compare these characteristics with sudden and unexpected deaths in infancy (SUDI) from explained causes. DESIGN: Three-year, population-based, case-control study. Parental interviews were conducted soon after the death and for 4 controls matched for age and date of interview. All sudden unexpected deaths were included in the study and the cause of death was established by a multidisciplinary panel of the relevant health care professionals taking into account past medical and social history of the mother and infant, the circumstances of death, and a full pediatric postmortem examination. Contributory factors and the final classification of death were made using the Avon clinicopathologic system. SETTING: Five regions in England, with a total population of >17 million people, took part in the study. The number of live births within these regions during the particular time each region was involved in the study was 473 000. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred twenty-five SIDS infants (91.3% of those available), 72 explained SUDI infants (86.7% of those available), and 1588 matched control infants (100% of total for cases included). RESULTS: Many of the epidemiologic features that characterize SIDS infants and families have remained the same, despite the recent decrease in SIDS incidence in the United Kingdom. These include the same characteristic age distribution, few deaths in the first few weeks of life or after 6 months, with a peak between 4 and 16 weeks, a higher incidence in males, lower birth weight, shorter gestation, and more neonatal problems at delivery. As in previous studies there was a strong correlation with young maternal age and higher parity and the risk increased for infants of single mothers and for multiple births. A small but significant proportion of index mothers had also experienced a previous stillbirth or infant death. The majority of the SIDS deaths (83%) occurred during the night sleep and there was no particular day of the week on which a significantly higher proportion of deaths occurred. Major epidemiologic features to change since the decrease in SIDS rate include a reduction in the previous high winter peaks of death and a shift of SIDS families to the more deprived social grouping. Just more than one quarter of the SIDS deaths (27%) occurred in the 3 winter months (December through February) in the 3 years of this study. In half of the SIDS families (49%), the lone parent or both parents were unemployed compared with less than a fifth of control families (18%). This difference was not explained by an excess of single mothers in the index group. Many of the significant factors relating to the SIDS infants and families that distinguish them from the normal population did not distinguish between SIDS and explained SUDI. In the univariate analysis many of the epidemiologic characteristics significant among the SIDS group were also identified and in the same direction among the infants dying as SUDI attributable to known causes. The explained deaths were similarly characterized by the same infant, maternal, and social factors, 48% of these families received no waged income. Using logistic regression to make a direct comparison between the two index groups there were only three significant differences between the two groups of deaths: 1) a different age distribution, the age distribution of the explained deaths peaked in the first 2 months and was more uniform thereafter; 2) more congenital anomalies were noted at birth (odds ratio [OR] = 3.14; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.52-6.

N2  - The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent chronic neurological illness, characterised by strange unpleasant sensations in the legs or less often in the arms, which occur predominately in the evening while sitting or lying in the bed with prompt relieve while standing up and walking. Some patient report involuntary movements which may persist during sleep in form of 'periodic movements in sleep' (PLMS). The main consequence in RLS may be a severe insomnia and sometimes an abnormal daytime sleepiness which may be accompanied by depression and suicidal ideas. PLMS are also known as an isolated phenomenon without clinical complaints or may be associated with insomnia or daytime sleepiness. A genetically based neurotransmittor disturbance in the spinal cord is suspected. The diagnosis should be established clinically, and electrophysiological and laboratory tests are needed to differentiate between an idiopathic and a number of symptomatic forms. The latter occur in association with a polyneuropathy, iron deficiency anaemia, uraemia, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis or gravidity. Beside causal therapies in some symptomatic forms L-DOPA, dopamin agonists, benzodiazepines and opiates can be used for symptomatic therapy.

N2  - Changes during pregnancy include reduced functional residual capacity and residual volume, increased alveolar-arterial difference for oxygen and, in the supine position, reduced cardiac output. In conjunction with sleep-related disturbances, these changes could lead to maternal oxygen desaturation during sleep. Because of conflicting data from respiratory sleep studies in late pregnancy, we performed complete polysomnography on 11 pregnant women at the 36th week of gestation and again postpartum. We also measured the PaO2 every 2 h. Contrary to many other studies, we found that during pregnancy PaO2 levels were significantly lower at 36 weeks of gestation compared to the postpartum period. This is probably related to the large volume of abdominal content, as in ascites, pneumoperitoneum and obesity, the effect of which is more severe in the supine position during sleep. We did not find any correlation between SaO2/PaO2 levels and apneas or hypopneas or percent of REM sleep. The frequency of apnea and hypopnea was significantly lower during pregnancy, which may be due to the raised level of progesterone. This may not preserve the maternal decrease in arterial oxygen tension during sleep, in pregnant healthy women.

N2  - Melatonin (MEL) is a widely used, over-the-counter sleep aid, and it has putative contraceptive, antioxidant, antiaging, and anticancer effects. The developmental toxicity potential for repeated oral doses of MEL had not previously been evaluated. In the present studies, time-mated, Sprague- Dawley-derived (CD®) rats were administered MEL or vehicle by gavage on gestation days (gd) 6-19. MEL-treated groups received 1-, 10-, 100-, 150-, or 200-mg/kg body weight/day in the screening study (15 rats/group), and 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day in the definitive study (25 rats/group). In both studies, maternal food/water consumption, body weight, and clinical signs were monitored at regular intervals throughout gestation. At termination (gd 20, both studies), maternal liver and gravid uterine weights, number of ovarian corpora lutea, conceptus survival, fetal sex, and fetal body weight were evaluated. Fetal morphological examination included external structures (both studies) as well as visceral and skeletal structures (definitive study). In the screening study, maternal serum levels of 17β-estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and luteinizing hormone were determined by radioimmunoassay, and mammary tissue was fixed, stained, and evaluated for percent glandular area within the fat pad. No maternal morbidity/mortality was found in either study. In the screening study, aversion to treatment (≥100 mg/kg/day) and reduced maternal weight gain (≥150 mg/kg/day) were noted, but reproductive/endocrine parameters and fetal development were not affected. In the definitive study, aversion to treatment was noted at ≥50 mg/kg/day, and mild sedation, reduced maternal food intake, and reduced body weight gain were found during initial treatment with 200 mg/kg/day. MEL had no effect on prenatal survival, fetal body weight, or incidences of fetal malformations/variations. Thus, in the definitive study, the maternal toxicity NOAEL and LOAEL were 100 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively, and the developmental toxicity NOAEL was ≥200 mg/kg/day.

N2  - Structural brain development undergoes rapid and complex changes during the last weeks of gestation. Polysomnographic registrations used in low risk preterm infants at various conceptional ages reflect the changing qualities of brain bioelectrical activity as well as of spontaneous motor behaviour and of autonomic functions. Information about these processes can be derived by visual and by automatic computer-assisted data analysis. Knowledge about development under normal conditions is crucial for clinical evaluation of high risk newborns. Data from the literature and from personal studies are described and their diagnostic and prognostic implications discussed. Polysomnography in preterm and term infants can serve as a valuable supplementary diagnostic tool to neurological examination and to various neuroimaging methods.

N2  - The primary factors in feeding premature infants are dependent on the development and maturation of digestion and absorption. The maturation of digestive and absorptive functions of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins in the young premature infant were determined in relation to availability of hydrolytic enzymes, such as lipases, proteases, amylases, glucosidases, and lactase. The feeding is dependent on the ability of the premature infant to secrete salivary enzymes, gastric acid, pepsin, pancreatic exocrine enzymes, the presence of enterohepatic circulation, and the hydrolytic and absorptive capacity of the entercocyte. To evaluate the complexity of the gut maturation process, we proposed a unified concept where the ontogeny of the gastrointestinal system is the result of the following four major determinants: genetic endowment, intrinsic developmental and biological clock, endogenous regulatory mechanisms, and environmental influences. The developmental clock represents a predetermined temporal sequence of happenings in ontogeny that is inherently controlled. By 20 weeks of gestation, the anatomic differentiation of the fetal gut has progressed to the extent that it resembles that of a newborn. Secretory and absorptive functions, however, develop at different rates; the intestinal absorptive process is only partially available before 26 weeks of gestation, whereas gastric and pancreatic secretion is only basal and can be stimulated only partially even in the full-term newborn period. Regulatory mechanisms control the expression of the genetic endowment at various stages in gastrointestinal development. Neural-hormonal factors play major roles in the ontogeny of the gut. Adrenalectomy, hypophysectomy, and thyroidectomy delay the development of the gut. Administration of glucocorticoids or thyroxine at the critical stage in maturation causes early appearance of enzymes within the intestine. Other hormones that are potentially important in regulating gastrointestinal development include cholecystokinin, gastrin, secretin, which have trophic effects on the gastrointestinal tract, and insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and epidermial growth factor. The development of gastrointestinal secretory function, particularly in response to hormonal stimulation, has received considerable attention. The degree of response of the target cell is determined not only by the amount of effective hormone reaching it but also by the number and affinity of receptors on its surface. Human newborns have high levels of gastrin in their sera, yet have low acid output. Exogenous gastrin is an ineffective stimulant despite the presence of seemingly "anatomically developed" parietal cells. It seems that neither endogenous nor exogenous gastrin has an effect on the target cell. If one accepts the role of circulating gastrin levels in the regulation of its own receptor, one can hypothesize the absence of a regulatory effect of gastrin in the newborn period. It was shown that hormonal regulation of migrating activity by motilin is also absent in the preterm and term infant. Plasma levels of motilin in neonates are comparable to those found in adults, but migrating motor complexes occur in the absence of cycling of plasma concentrations. Interestingly, however, the motilin receptor appears to be present. In conclusion, the feeding mode content, concentration, and volume of the very young premature infant can be assessed by the development of digestive and absorptive capacity and gut motility. The concomitant changes in gut hormones and regulatory peptides during ontogeny and feeding will add a new dimension in the understanding of when, what, and how to feed the very young premature infant.

N2  - Epidemiologic studies indicated formula-feeding and heavy smoking of parents as risk factors of SID. From a clinical-physiological point of view, obstructive sleep apnea and periodic breathing in infants are discussed as markers of an increased risk of SID. We intended to test the hypothesis, that clinical-physiological factors were dependent on epidemiological factors. In a total of 302 infants the status of epidemiological risk factors was assessed by history and a polygraphic sleep recording was performed. We used the method of logistic regression in order to find possible intercorrelations. Heavy maternal smoking during pregnancy (10 cigarettes per day or more) was found to be the decisive influence on the occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea in the infant. In the first year of life, infants of heavy smoking mothers were found to have a significant higher occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea than infants of non-smoking mothers. Strength of this intercorrelation was age-dependent, risk of obstructive sleep apnea being highest when infants were 14 to 42 days of age (O.R. 8.6, 95 % CI 2.0; 36.1, p=0.003). Periodic breathing was more frequent in breast-fed infants in their 7th to 10 th week of life (O.R. 8.0, 95 % CI 2.9;22.3, p = 0.0001). Independent of age girls were more likely to have periodic breathing than boys (O.R. 2.3, 95 % CI 1.4;3.9, p = 0.002). Conclusion: Heavy maternal smoking in pregnancy seem to increase obstructive apnea within the same age range, in which epidemiology showed maternal smoking augmenting the SID incidence. In contrast, occurrence of periodic breathing was correlated to epidemiologic factors, known to be associated with lower risk of SID. Periodic breathing was found to be higher in breast-fed infants and in girls. These findings support the opinion, that periodic breathing should not be regarded as a pathologic breathing pattern in clinically healthy full term infants.

N2  - Prenatal stress impairs activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress in adult offspring. So far, very few data are available on the effects of prenatal stress on circadian functioning of the HPA axis. Here, we studied the effects of prenatal stress on the circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion in male and female adult rats. To evaluate the effects of prenatal stress on various regulatory components of corticosterone secretion, we also assessed the diurnal fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin, total and free corticosterone levels, and hippocampal corticosteroid receptors. Finally, in the search of possible maternal factors, we studied the effects of repeated restraint stress on the pattern of corticosterone secretion in pregnant female rats. Results demonstrate that prenatal stress induced higher levels of total and free corticosterone secretion at the end of the light period in both males and females, and hypercorticism over the entire diurnal cycle in females. No diurnal fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin was observed in any group studied. The effects of prenatal stress on corticosterone secretion could be mediated, at least in part, by a reduction in corticosteroid receptors at specific times of day. Results also show that prepartal stress alters the pattern of corticosterone secretion in pregnant females. Those data indicate that prenatally stressed rats exhibit an altered temporal functioning of the HPA axis, which, taken together with their abnormal response to stress, reinforces the idea of a general homeostatic dysfunction in those animals.

N2  - This study investigated the belief held by over 50% of parous women that they are more forgetful during pregnancy and postpartum relative to other times. Comparisons were made between both the reported and objective memory performances of three groups of women (n = 20 per group), (1) primigravid, (2) primiparous (baby younger than 12 months), and (3) never been pregnant, matched on age and education levels. Participants completed a questionnaire on demographic, health, and sleep details, the Inventory of Memory Experiences, and tests of implicit, explicit, and working memory. The groups did not differ on self-rated levels of physical or emotional health, or anxiety level. The primigravid and primiparous groups reported overall poorer memory performance since pregnancy relative to controls. The primigravid group also reported significantly more sleep disruption, with this being a significant predictor of reported memory change. On the objective tests, there were no differences between groups on the implicit and explicit memory tests, but the primigravid and primiparous groups scored significantly lower on a test of working memory. Self-reports of memory change during pregnancy and postpartum may be related to life changes, such as sleep change, and may effect changed perceptions rather than objective changes.

N2  - AIMS: To determine whether exposure to fluoridated water supplies prenatally or postnatally at the time of death increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). METHODS: A nationwide, case-control study, with infant's water fluoridation status determined from census area unit information for mother's usual address at the time of the infant's birth, infant's usual address at the time of death / nominated sleep and address where infant died / was at nominated sleep. SIDS risk associated with fluoride exposure postnatally was assessed according to method of infant feeding (breast or reconstituted formula), for the two days prior to infant's death / nominated sleep. RESULTS: Infants exposed to fluoridated water supplies during pregnancy were not at increased risk for SIDS, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82, 1.74). For breast-fed infants at the time of death / nominated sleep, fluoridated water exposure was not associated with an increased risk for SIDS, adjusted OR 1.09 (95% CI 0.66, 1.79). Similarly, 'fluoridated' formula feeding, when compared with 'unfluoridated' formula feeding, showed no increased risk of SIDS, adjusted OR 1.25 (95% CI 0.73, 2.13). There was no evidence of an interaction between fluoridation and infant feeding for the last two days (chi2 = 0.171, df = 1, p = 0.68). CONCLUSION: Exposure to a fluoridated water supply prenatally or postnatally at the time of death did not affect the relative risk for SIDS.

N2  - Background. Contradictory findings on the effect of betamethasone versus dexamethasone on antenatal tests of fetal well-being have been reported. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of these steroid compounds on fetal heart rate patterns and biophysical activities in a prospective, randomized trial. Study design. Forty-six pregnant women (gestational age range 27-34 weeks) at risk for preterm delivery were randomized to receive betamethasone or dexamethasone for enhancement of fetal lung maturity. Fetal heart rate was recorded for 60 minutes and analyzed with the Sonicaid System 8000 before (0 hours), and 48 hours and 96 hours after steroid administration. Subsequently, fetal limb, body and breathing movements were sonographically observed and quantified for 30 minutes. To account for fetal circadian rhythms, all examinations were performed between 1 p.m, and 5 p.m., at least one hour after maternal meals. Results. Fetal heart rate accelerations (p < 0.001; p < 0.O1), short-term variation p < 0.0001; p < O.05), long-term variation (p < 0.01; p = NS), duration of high episodes (p < 0.001; p < 0.05), total movement count (p < 0.001; p < 0.05), and duration of breathing time (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001) were substantially reduced 48 h after betamethasone and dexamethasone administration, respectively, with percent reduction being larger for the betamethasone group, except for breathing movements (p < 0.05; p < 0.001; p < 0.001; p < 0.005; p < 0.05; p = NS; respectively). In 68.2% and 45.5% of fetuses, less than 30 seconds of continuous breathing movements were found in the betamethasone and dexamethasone groups, respectively. In 71.8% and 12.5% of fetuses, respectively, less than 2 body/limb movements were observed. Therefore five and two fetuses in the betamethasone and dexamethasone study group, respectively, had both nonreactive fetal heart rate monitors for 60 minutes and biophysical profiles of ≤ 4/10. All parameters returned to baseline values at 96 h. Baseline fetal heart rate and numbers of decelerations remained unchanged (p = NS). Conclusions. Both betamethasone and dexamethasone induce a profound, albeit transient, suppression of fetal heart rate characteristics and biophysical activities in the preterm fetus. However, the effect of betamethasone is more pronounced. Awareness of these phenomena might prevent unwarranted iatrogenic delivery of preterm fetuses.

N2  - Twenty-six pregnant women were assigned to a massage therapy or a relaxation therapy group for 5 weeks. The therapies consisted of 20-min sessions twice a week. Both groups reported feeling less anxious after the first session and less leg pain after the first and last session. Only the massage therapy group, however, reported reduced anxiety, improved mood, better sleep and less back pain by the last day of the study. In addition, urinary stress hormone levels (norepinephrine) decreased for the massage therapy group and the women had fewer complications during labor and their infants had fewer postnatal complications (e.g., less prematurity).

N2  - Objective: To examine whether maternal pregnancy complications, adverse birth events, respiratory illnesses, or developmental difficulty were increased in neurologically normal children with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and whether severity of OSA adversely affects the child's development and temperament. Methodology: Maternal report of perinatal events, respiratory illness and developmental difficulty in 37 children with OSA was contrasted with a comparison group (n = 67). Children with OSA were assessed developmentally (Griffiths Scales), had a parental rating of temperament (Australian Temperament Scale) and attended an overnight polysomnographic sleep study. Results: Children with OSA had an increased prevalence of adverse maternal pregnancy and perinatal events, respiratory disease and developmental concerns. Limited associations were found between the severity of OSA and development or temperament difficulty. Conclusions: This study suggests a relationship between OSA, though not its severity, and pre/perinatal adversity and child development. Polysomnographic and detailed developmental assessment of community-based samples of children with OSA and control children are necessary to confirm these findings.

N2  - Case reports of four patients with therapy-resistant lesional partial epilepsies and additional foci of benign epileptic discharges of childhood, in addition to the usual electroencephalogram (EEG) changes, are presented. A family history of epileptic or febrile seizures in childhood was reported in all four patients. A distant relative of one patient, not manifesting seizures, demonstrated rolandic spikes on EEG. An abnormal pregnancy (polyhydramnion, premature pains, induced labor because of an abnormal CTG, placenta insufficiency) was reported in one patient, risk factors during birth (birth 14 days after term, placenta insufficiency) were reported in one, and bacterial meningitis at 4 weeks of age was reported in one. All patients manifested a retarded, partly severe, unfavorable infantile psychomotor development. An early seizure onset was observed in all patients (in three patients during the first year of life and in one patient during the second year). A hemifacial seizure symptomatology was seen, in addition to other symptoms, in two patients, possibly indicating the seizure pattern indicative of benign partial seizures; seizures occurred exclusively in sleep in one patient. The benign focus was never located in the lesional area. It was recorded over the same hemisphere in two patients and over the other hemisphere in the other two.

N2  - It has been assumed that women recover from pregnancy and childbirth within 6 weeks. Recent research shows that women's fatigue levels are the same, or higher, at 6 weeks postpartum as at the time of delivery. This study determined the differences in primiparous women's fatigue and energy levels at 6 weeks and 14 to 19 months postpartum. Determinations of how some contributing factors and outcomes of postpartum fatigue relate to each other and to fatigue and energy at 14 to 19 months postpartum were also made. Analyses revealed that women are more fatigued and less energetic at 14 to 19 months than they were at 6 weeks postpartum. Quality of sleep did not correlate with fatigue or energy. At 14 to 19 months postpartum return to full functional status is almost complete, with household and infant care responsibilities being most complete. The women were experiencing mild life crises of various sorts, were somewhat depressed, and were gratified in the mothering role.

N2  - Leg cramps in pregnancy, defined as painful spasms of the calf, were investigated among women giving birth at the maternity ward at Baerum Hospital from 1 October to 20 October 1997. A questionnaire distributed to 120 women three days after parturition revealed that 45% had suffered from leg cramps during pregnancy. Among 54% of them the cramps appeared after the 25th week of pregnancy. 76% of the women had experienced the symptoms twice per week or less often; 81% of them suffered from painful cramps only during night-time. We conclude that leg cramps are still a common symptom in pregnancy and may compromise sleep and hence the ability to work.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to understand the sleep-wake cycle during the period from late pregnancy to about 3 months of postpartum by evaluating the number of actigraphic activities in four women (one multipara and three primi gravidae), and to compare the results with the findings from sleep logs. An irregularity of the sleep-wake cycle with increased number of wakings at night was notable during about l month after delivery, compared to the late pregnancy period, and subsequently this number tended to decrease. These results were indicative of the association between the lactation cycle to neonates and the sleep-wake cycle.

N2  - We previously demonstrated that pregnancy-associated sleep enhancement is correlated with the daily surges of prolactin (PRL). However, in spite of a surge of PRL in the proestrus night, a reduction of nocturnal sleep occurs in phase with proestrus. Therefore, to clarify the physiological role of PRL in sleep regulation during the estrous cycle, time-course changes in sleep were analyzed in bromocriptine (CB-154)-treated and/or PRL-supplemented female rats. Sleep patterns characteristic of proestrus-to-estrus were not affected by the CB-154 treatment. In contrast, nocturnal rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) was significantly increased after the PRL supplementation. The CB-154 treatment diminished the REMS-enhancing effect of PRL. Thus, the results suggest that the endogenous PRL is not crucial for the regulation of sleep during the estrous cycle, while exogenous PRL can enhance REMS.

N2  - Shift work and night work in particular have been associated with sleep difficulties, general malaise, fatigue, peptic ulceration, ischaemic heart disease, cigarette smoking and adverse pregnancy outcome. The medical conditions previously regarded as making individuals unsuitable for shift work show wide ranging patho-physiological activity and there is no published evidence for any such condition to be regarded an absolute reason to exclude an individual from shift work. The fulfilment of the legal obligations of the Working Time Regulations 1998 is neither prescribed nor constrained in any way. It is advisable therefore to build on existing health procedures where they are in effect. Periodic health questionnaires can offer health professionals an opportunity to detect any disorder likely to be aggravated by shift work or by a combination of shift work, job demands and workplace conditions. A further purpose of the questionnaire is the assessment of ability to undertake shift work duties. However, health questionnaires are neither sensitive nor specific enough to be used to select applicants or employees for shift work, since they do not consistently predict tolerance of shift work or subsequent health problems. Whether employers should offer anything more than a simple questionnaire will depend on the culture of the company and accessibility of health services. Screening programmes affect many people relative to the few who benefit and with existing knowledge, periodic general health examinations performed in asymptomatic subjects have limited predictive or preventive value.

N2  - Cigarette smoking during pregnancy increases the incidence of perinatal mortality and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). We have evaluated prenatal or postnatal nicotine exposure in developing rats to examine the potential role of altered neurotransmitter receptor expression in these processes. Pregnant rats received continuous infusions of nicotine throughout gestation, at doses mimicking the plasma levels found in smokers. After birth, cardiac M2-muscarinic cholinergic receptors, which are responsible for inhibitory autonomic actions, were enhanced in the nicotine group, coincidentally with decreases in stimulatory β-adrenergic receptors that have been demonstrated previously. Studies of adenylyl cyclase activity confirmed that the changes in receptor binding represented functional alterations: the stimulatory response to isoproterenol was obtunded by prenatal nicotine exposure, whereas the inhibitory response to carbachol was enhanced. Elevations of M2- muscarinic receptor binding were not generalized to all tissues, as the same prenatal nicotine treatment elicited a reduction in these receptors in the brainstem, an effect that has also been noted in infants who died of SIDS; we found no effects of prenatal nicotine on brainstem M1-receptor binding. Postnatal administration of nicotine produced similar brainstem receptor effects when treatment was conducted during the first postnatal week but not thereafter; postnatal nicotine treatment did not affect cardiac M2-receptor binding. Thus, during a critical developmental period, nicotine exposure produces cardiac and brainstem receptor imbalances that favor inhibitory responses, effects that can contribute to morbidity and mortality evoked by hypoxic episodes, such as those experienced during parturition, sleep apnea or airway obstruction.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe perceived levels of fatigue and energy before, during, and after pregnancy in a group of healthy women experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies; and to examine relationships between their perception of fatigue and energy, parity, and physiologic indicators of sleep disturbances, thyroid function, and iron deficiency. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal. SETTING: Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 24 primiparous and 1 8 multiparous women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in fatigue and energy over time. Measures were obtained at follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle before pregnancy, at each trimester, and at 1 and 3 months after delivery. RESULTS: Younger age and lower prepregnancy levels of iron, ferritin, and hemoglobin explained 1st trimester fatigue. Less total sleep was related to fatigue in the 3rd trimester. Postpartum fatigue was related to reduced amounts of sleep and low levels of ferritin and hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of premenstrual (luteal) fatigue, progesterone levels were unrelated to fatigue. Neither paid employment nor family variables influenced perception of fatigue. Nurses working with childbearing populations should counsel women about significant 1st trimester fatigue so they can prepare their work and home environments in an attempt to achieve adequate rest.

N2  - Changes in prenatal care practices resulted from a pilot study with 12 urban New Mexican women who received no prenatal care. The women were interviewed regarding their reasons for not receiving care during pregnancy, health behaviors, and perceived neonatal outcomes. Data on actual neonatal outcomes were taken from the medical record. Maternal reasons for no prenatal care were socio-demographic, system-related, attitudinal, and outside forces of job and childcare. To ensure a healthy baby, the women made changes in their nutrition, self-care activities, substance use, sleep, and exercise activities. All of the women perceived they had a healthy baby. Yet 61% of the neonates had complications and 45% were low birth weight. The research findings were used to develop a care management program that included case management and utilization management.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The authors presented physiological conditions associated with increased prolactin values (sleep, stress, hypoglycemia, nipples stimulation, pregnancy and lactation) as well as the causes of pathological hyperprolactinemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The results of radioimmunoassay study have been analyzed in concern to the values of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin (PRL) obtained from the serum of 100 women with increased PRL levels. The "HOECHT" sets were used for the analysis, whereas the values up to 20.9 microgrammes per litre were rated normal. The patients were distributed into 4 groups in concern to the level of PRL increase: 1st group--twenty (n = 20) patients with PRL values from 21-29.9 micrograms/l, 90 blood samples analyzed; 2nd group-forty (n = 40) patients with PRL values f; 30-49.9 micrograms/l, 183 blood samples analyzed; 3rd group--twenty (n = 20) patients with PRL values from 50-99.9 micrograms/l, 83 blood samples analyzed; 4th group--twenty patients (n = 20) with PRL values more than 100 micrograms/l, 78 blood samples analyzed. The values of FSH and LH recorded in the women with hyperprolactinemia were compared with mean values of the same hormones presented in IU/l from the follicular phase of the cycle in the control group which comprised 50 women of reproductive age having normal ovulatory menstrual cycle. RESULTS: The mean values of FSH and LH in the 1st group have not presented with statistically significant difference in relation to the control group. Prevalence of menstrual disorders was 30%, which was statistically significantly higher than in general population. FSH values in the 2nd group were almost the same as in the control group whereas the values of LH were significantly higher. The rate of polycistic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in this group has been significant, also the increased rate of anovulatory cycles from 30 to 67.5%. A mild increase of menstrual cycle rhythm disorders, from 35 to 40% has been recorded. The values of FSH and LH in the 3rd group were significantly lower than in the control group. The significance level was higher for FSH (p < 0.01) then LH (p < 0.05). There was a sudden increase of the cycle rhythm disorders in this group reaching 90%. The 4th group presented with significantly lower values of FSH and LH in relation to the control group, whereas the cycle rhythm disorders occurred in all patients. DISCUSSION: The obtained results were compared with the literature data and some explanations given. CONCLUSIONS: The values of FSH an LH were statistically significantly lower in the 3rd and 4th group. The 2nd group was characteristic for the sudden increase of the number of anovulatory cycles from 30 to 67.5%, whereas the 3rd group presented with the abrupt increase of menstrual cycle rhythm disorders, from 40 to 90%.

N2  - The cardiac orienting reflex is elicited by a low-intensity sound, it consists of a sustained heart rate (HR) deceleration, and it is a specific physiological correlate of cognitive processing. In this study we examined the relationship between behavioral state and the cardiac orienting reflex in 75 human fetuses between 36 and 40 weeks gestation. Each fetus was stimulated with a 30-s speech sound at an average intensity of 83 dB SPL in quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS). The fetal cardiac electrical signal was captured transabdominally at a rate of 1024 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal processing. Fetal behavioral states were assigned based on HR pattern and the presence or absence of eye and general body movements. We found that a significant HR deceleration occurred, in both QS and AS, following stimulus onset. However, HR decelerations occurred more often in QS than AS; and for fetuses exhibiting a HR deceleration, the magnitude of the deceleration was greater in AS compared to QS. In addition, in AS female fetuses exhibited a larger, more sustained HR deceleratory response than male fetuses, but the secondsxgender interaction in QS was not significant. Based on these results, we concluded that behavioral state is an important determinant of the HR deceleratory response in human fetuses. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To identify the levels of grief and depression and the coping mechanisms of women with infertility problems who participated in in vitro fertilization (IVF) or ovulation-induction medication. Methods: Pretest and post-test data were obtained from 50 IVF and 50 ovulation-induction medication patients receiving treatment at two urban infertility centers. Results: Both groups of women experienced measurable levels of grief and depression before, during, and after treatment. Higher scores on the Grief Experience Inventory were found for both groups of women when pregnancy did not occur. Age, reproductive problems, years infertile, financial impact, and number of past IVF cycles were not found to influence the reported grief or depression levels. Women in the IVF and ovulation-induction medication groups used isolation coping behaviors such as self-talk and sleep. Conclusion: Because of moderate to high levels of grief and depression, therapeutic counseling may be more effective if initiated before the infertility treatment. Women's present levels of distress and coping strategies should be assessed prior to initiating infertility treatment to provide the patients with opportunities to learn and practice new adaptive behaviors that could enhance their ability to cope with infertility and the associated medical procedures.

N2  - Coffee is commonly given daily to toddlers in Guatemala. Possible negative effects of coffee ingestion on cognitive development and sleep patterns were assessed in 132 children 12-24 months of age who had received coffee for >2 months and were iron deficient on at least one indicator. Children were stratified by initial hemoglobin (A=anemic, Hgb <10.5 g/dl; NA='non-anemic', Hgb ≥10.5 g/dl) and were randomly assigned to an experimental group (S=substitute consisting of sugar and coloring), and a control group (C=continuation of coffee) (42 C-NA; 53 S-NA; 18 C-A; and 19 S-A). Anemic children were provided Fe supplements for 2-3 months. Compliance was assessed every 2 weeks. After 5 months, testers masked to treatment group and anemia evaluated children with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II in a central location. Scores were the Mental Development Index (MDI), the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI), and scales from the Behavior Rating Scale (BRS). The child's sleep in the previous 24 h was assessed with a set of standardized sleep questions to the care giver on the first visit and every 2 weeks thereafter. No significant effects of treatment on test scores or BRS ratings were found. In the 24 h period reported on at the final visit, children in the Substitute group slept more during the night and overall (night plus naps) than children in the Coffee group, a difference not found at the first visit. No differences were found in sleep difficulty or number of times waking at night. Women's reported coffee intake per day during pregnancy was associated with lower BRS ratings, even after controlling for SES and child age. The effects of postnatal coffee ingestion in Guatemala were seen for sleep duration, but not for cognitive development. Prenatal coffee ingestion was negatively associated with Behavior Rating Scales and should be investigated further. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) of 31 hospitalized pregnant women at low risk of hypertension were automatically monitored for 48 h at 15-min intervals. Each of the recorded 56 data series for systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), and HR was chronobiologically assessed by linear-nonlinear rhythmometry. The rhythm-adjusted mean (MESOR), circadian amplitude, circadian acrophase, and best-fitting period were grouped by pregnancy trimester and further subjected to analysis of variance. BP MESOR remained unaltered, whereas HR MESOR increased significantly in middle and late pregnancy. Ultradian rhythms, with an amplitude higher than that of the circadian rhythm, were found in 25% of the SAP records in the second and third trimester. Such ultradian rhythms were not detected in the simultaneously recorded HR. Finally, the group BP and HR circadian acrophases coincided in the first trimester, but were significantly apart in mid and late pregnancy. These observations support the notion that the coordination of BP and HR rhythmicity involves different physiological mechanisms. Analysis of the individual variability in the chronobiological end points (based on the records of nine women monitored in each pregnancy trimester) revealed that only the BP MESOR was well reproducible in the course of pregnancy and may be useful in early diagnosis of gestational hypertension.

N2  - In this perspective article, the authors focus on gender as it relates to pulmonary disease. The very real threat of smoking and lung cancer has been recognized, but gender-related issues in other conditions have not been emphasized. There are minor differences in bronchial responsiveness and breathing mechanics between men and women. The subconscious conversion disorder of vocal cord dyskinesis occurs predominantly in young adult women. Sleep apnea and sleep-disordered breathing have a prevalence of 4% in men and 2% in women, aged 30 to 60 years. Many of these women may go unrecognized or be labeled with chronic fatigue syndrome if a good history for sleep disorders is not obtained. Primary pulmonary hypertension is more common in women than men but only by 1.7 to 1.0 for all ages. With further review of the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) data, the correlation of pulmonary embolism to estrogen use, child-bearing, and an increased incidence of thrombophlebitis has not been as strong as previously reported. Diseases such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and the catamenial syndromes of pneumothorax, pleural effusions, and/or hemoptysis are unique to women but often present as perplexing clinical problems. The premenstrual exacerbation of asthma has been reported with increasing frequency. As evidence-based medical literature accumulates, gender-related differences and similarities will be clarified by studies with both men and women as subjects.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To test preterm neonates' physiologic and behavioral responses when placed skin-to-skin on their mother's chests, called kangaroo care (KC), for the first 6 hours after birth, instead of having the neonates go to an intensive care unit. DESIGN: Convenience sampling was used in this descriptive study to enroll neonates who were given continuous KC beginning soon after birth in the delivery room and continuing for 6 hours. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, abdominal temperature, and behavioral state were recorded each minute. SETTING: Data were collected in the delivery room and in a private labor room in tropical Cali, Colombia. PARTICIPANTS: Six 34-36-week preterm neonates with 5-minute APGAR scores of 6 or more were enrolled. Two neonates had grunting respirations before KC was begun. RESULTS: Temperature rose rapidly to thermoneutral range. With few exceptions, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation remained within normal limits; grunting respirations in two neonates disappeared with warmed humidified oxygen and continuous KC. Sleep predominated, and neonates were discharged home by 48 hours being fully breastfed, suggesting that KC was an environment conducive to recovery from fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that KC beginning in the delivery room can be given safely and perhaps with benefit to 34-36-week gestation neonates who appear healthy at birth. Kangaroo care was conducive to recovery from birth-related fatigue.

N2  - The effects of maternal melatonin on fetal and neonatal melatonin and dopamine D1 receptor systems in the central nervous system, mainly in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), were investigated after pinealectomy of rats at day 7 of pregnancy. 125I-labelled iodomelatonin injected intravenously into the pregnant rats (at day 21) was transferred in considerable amount into the fetal circulation. In vitro autoradiography data demonstrated an increase in the melatonin binding activity in the fetal (embryonic day 21) and early postnatal SCN (postnatal day 3) caused by maternal pinealectomy. This upregulation of the melatonin receptor in the SCN was then normalized after the melatonin system of the neonate started to work. The pregnant rats themselves did not show such a change in their melatonin receptors in the SCN following pinealectomy. Dopamine D1 receptor binding was affected by pinealectomy exclusively in the SCN of fetal and neonatal rats as well as in that of mothers. These results clearly indicate that the fetal circadian clock in the SCN is controlled and prepared before birth to some extent by maternal melatonin rhythm.

N2  - We studied changes in the sleep patterns of ten young women from late pregnancy (36 weeks) to the sixth postpartum week, focusing on the relationship between the women's sleep patterns and their infants' movements. The mothers' polysomnograms and their infants' ankle actigrams were simultaneously recorded using a Medilog 9000 at home in three sessions, during the first, third, and sixth postpartum weeks. The mother-infant pairs slept in close proximity. Two subjects had difficulty with their infants and were dealt with as a separate group. Analysis for the eight subjects who adapted well to the postpartum period showed that wake time after sleep onset increased significantly during the postpartum period compared with late pregnancy given responsibility for feeding. Stage 3 + 4 and Stage REM did not change across the four sessions (pregnancy, first, third, and sixth postpartum weeks), but Stage 2 decreased significantly from pregnancy to postpartum. There was a high synchronization between infants' movements and mothers' wakefulness. Eight mothers did not complain of sleep disturbance, while the two mothers who had difficulty with their infants did. We suggest that mothers who tolerate well sleep interruption arising from feeding and maintain their Stages 3 + 4 and REM should not be considered as suffering from sleep disturbance. Mothers who have difficulty with their infants and complain of sleep disturbance should be considered as suffering from sleep disturbance.

N2  - We describe a case of lingual thyroid (LT) with primary hypothyroidism, presenting during pregnancy and continuing beyond it with oropharyngeal obstructive symptoms and sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) of mixed type. Although SAS of a combined obstructive and central type should not be too surprising in a case of LT with hypothyroidism, we were unable to find such a documentation previously. Only four weeks of L-thyroxin treatment resulted in a dramatic improvement in dysphagia, disturbed phonation, haemoptysis, arterial desaturation, sleep apnoea and overall sleep efficiency, in conjunction with a regression in the size of the lingual mass. This case highlights the vagaries confronted in the management of such a case and focuses on efforts towards accurate diagnosis and treatment.

N2  - Our aim was to determine the effects of intrauterine compromise, induced by maternal anemia, on ventilatory responsiveness of the sleeping newborn to progressive asphyxia. We induced anemia in 6 sheep for the final third of pregnancy and studied their offspring for 2-3 weeks after birth. Lambs from anemic ewes were growth-restricted at birth; they and 6 control lambs were chronically instrumented soon after birth and underwent studies during which we determined ventilatory and arousal responsiveness to a progressive asphyxic stimulus during sleep. During quiet wakefulness, active sleep and quiet sleep, lambs from anemic ewes had elevated end-tidal CO2 levels (FECO2,%) compared to controls. Ventilatory responsiveness (i.e., gradient of relationship between minute ventilation and FECO2) was greater in quiet sleep than in active sleep for both groups of lambs but did not differ between the two groups in either active or quiet sleep. Lambs from anemic ewes had significantly higher FECO2 values than controls before arousing from either active or quiet sleep. Other indices of arousability (time to arousal, percent hemoglobin saturation at arousal) were not different between the two groups. Our results indicate that prenatal exposure to maternal anemia induces fetal growth restriction and elevates the CO2 'set-point' for normal ventilation. It does not, however, produce significant abnormalities in ventilatory responsiveness to progressive asphyxia during sleep.

N2  - Failure to autoresuscitate by hypoxic gasping during prolonged sleep apnea has been suggested to play a role in sudden infant death. Furthermore, maternal smoking has been repeatedly shown to be a risk factor for sudden infant death. The present experiments were carried out on newborn rat pups to investigate the influence of perinatal exposure to nicotine (the primary pharmacological and addictive agent in tobacco) on their time to last gasp during a single hypoxic exposure and on their ability to autoresuscitate during repeated exposure to hypoxia. Pregnant rats received either nicotine (6 mg·kg-1·24 h-1) or vehicle continuously from day 6 of gestation to days 5 or 6 postpartum via an osmotic minipump. On days 5 or 6 postpartum, pups were exposed either to a single period of hypoxia (97% N2-3% CO2) and their time to last gasp was determined, or they were exposed repeatedly to hypoxia and their ability to autoresuscitate from primary apnea was determined. Perinatal exposure to nicotine did not alter the time to last gasp, but it did impair the ability of pups to autoresuscitate from primary apnea. After vehicle, the pups were able to autoresuscitate from 18 ± 1 (SD) periods of hypoxia, whereas, after nicotine, the pups were able to autoresuscitate from only 12 ± 2 periods (P < 0.001) of hypoxia. Thus our data provide evidence that perinatal exposure to nicotine impairs the ability of newborn rats to autoresuscitate from primary apnea during repeated exposure to hypoxia, such as may occur during episodes of prolonged sleep apnea.

N2  - Being overweight increases the risk of developing many common diseases including type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, gallstones and various cancers of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. It can also cause or exacerbate osteoarthritis, breathlessness, heartburn, sleep apnoea, venous thromboembolism and psychological distress, particularly anxiety and depression. It makes anaesthesia and surgery more hazardous, and in pregnancy increases the risks associated with childbirth. Being overweight can also complicate day-to-day social functioning such as negotiating seats on public transport or purchasing clothes. In this article, we review the evidence that weight loss is beneficial and how this might be achieved using lifestyle changes, drug therapy, or surgery.

N2  - The occurrence of migraine in women is influenced by hormonal changes throughout the lifecycle. A beneficial effect of pregnancy on migraine, mainly during the last 2 trimesters, has been observed in 55 to 90% of women who are pregnant, irrespective of the type of migraine. A higher percentage of women with menstrual migraine find that their condition improves when they are pregnant. However, in rare cases migraine may appear for the first time during pregnancy. The positive effects of pregnancy on migraine and the possible worsening post partum are probably related to the uniformly high and stable estrogen levels during pregnancy and the rapid fall-off thereafter. Nondrug therapies (relaxation, sleep, massage, ice packs, biofeedback) should be tried first to treat migraine in women who are pregnant. For treatment of acute migraine attacks 1000 mg of paracetamol (acetaminophen) preferably as a suppository is considered the first choice drug treatment. The risks associated with use of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and ibuprofen are considered to be small when the agents are taken episodically and if they are avoided during the last trimester of pregnancy. The 'triptans' (sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan), dihydroergotamine and ergotamine tartrate are contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Prochlor perazine for treatment of nausea is unlikely to be harmful during pregnancy. Metoclopramide is probably acceptable to use during the second and third trimester. Prophylactic treatment is rarely indicated and the only agents that can be given during pregnancy are the β-blockers metoprolol and propranolol.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the differences in sleep of women throughout pregnancy compared with those of nonpregnant control subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Four pregnant women were studied longitudinally during their pregnancy using inpatient polysomnography. Measurements included electroencephalography, electrocardiography, and continuous-pulse oximetry. Four healthy nonpregnant women matched for age and weight were used as control subjects. The total sleep time was recorded, and percentages of each sleep stage were generated. RESULTS: Qualitative differences in sleep between pregnancy patients and control subjects were evident. Control subjects displayed a normal appearance of slow-wave sleep in stages 3 and 4 (delta sleep). When pregnant patients did display delta sleep, it appeared abnormal secondary to extensive alpha-wave intrusion. Even when including this abnormal delta sleep in a quantitative comparison, the pregnant patients had a significantly shorter percentage of total sleep time in delta sleep (4.9+/-1.9% vs 21.9+/-6.0%, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Sleep in pregnancy is characterized by loss of normal slow-wave sleep. Thus, sleep stages 3 and 4 are shortened during pregnancy. This sleep alteration is persistent when followed longitudinally during pregnancy.

N2  - Disturbed sleep regulation is often observed in neonates of women who drank heavily during pregnancy. It is unknown if (and how) an occasional drink affects fetal sleeping behavior. In 28 near-term pregnant women we examined the effects on fetal behavioral state organization of two glasses of wine (0.25 g of ethanol/kg of maternal body weight). Simultaneous 2-h recordings of fetal heart rate and body, eye, and breathing movements were made on two successive days, once without alcohol exposure and once during maternal alcohol consumption. The study was standardized for time of day and fetal sleep state, i.e. the start of recording was either during quiet sleep (n = 16) or during active sleep (n = 12). Alcohol intake reduced fetal eye movements, disorganized behavioral state organization (rapid eye movement sleep was affected in particular), and suppressed fetal breathing activity almost completely. Modest maternal alcohol intake affects fetal behavioral state organization, which reflects an immediate effect on fetal brain function.

N2  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of postneonatal mortality in the United States. In 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended that all healthy babies be put to sleep either on their back or side to reduce the risk for SIDS. In 1994, a national "Back to Sleep" education campaign was initiated to encourage the public and health-care providers to put babies to sleep on their back or side. In November 1996, the AAP modified its policy to preferentially recommend putting infants on their back because of the lower risk for SIDS associated with this position relative to the side position. To assess adherence to recommendations for infant sleeping position, CDC analyzed population-based data on the usual infant sleeping position for 1996 births by race from 10 states participating in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis and indicates that infant sleeping position varied by state and race.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to systematically investigate previous anecdotal reports of memory decline during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: We used a longitudinal design to investigate memory in women throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period. Closely matched, nonpregnant women were similarly studied at equivalent intervals. We also assessed degree of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: There was a significant time-by-group interaction (P < .01) for both immediate and delayed recall of paragraph length material. Contrasts showed a significant decline in memory for the pregnant group from the second to the third trimester (P < .01). No significant changes in memory were noted for the control group. The pregnant women scored higher on both depression and anxiety scales; however, somatic rather than cognitive items accounted for the elevated scores. Fluctuations in mood and memory did not coincide. CONCLUSION: There is a pregnancy- related decline in memory, which is limited to the third trimester. The decline is not attributable to depression, anxiety, sleep deprivation, or other physical changes associated with pregnancy.

N2  - Children of women who consume high amounts of alcohol during their pregnancies vary greatly in physical and behavioral outcomes. Although many factors, such as dose and timing of exposure, undoubtedly contribute to this variation, one important determinant may be genetic differences in the response to alcohol. The present study examined activity levels in high alcohol sensitivity (HAS) and low alcohol sensitivity (LAS) rats following neonatal alcohol exposure. These lines were selectively bred for extremes in ethanol-induced 'sleep times.' The HAS and LAS offspring were exposed to alcohol via an artificial rearing procedure using the 'pup-in-the-cup' technique. Rat pups were exposed to ethanol (6 g/kg/day) from postnatal day (PD) 4 through 7 and faded to a dose of 3 g/kg/day on PD 8 and 9. An artificially reared gastrostomy control group (GC) and a normally reared suckle control group (SC) were also included. Activity level was measured on PD 18 through PD 21 for 30 min daily in automated activity monitors. Neonatal ethanol exposure produced overactivity in HAS rats, relative to their controls, but the same ethanol treatment had no effect on the LAS rats. Importantly, there were no differences in blood alcohol concentrations (around 420 mg/dl) between the two lines during the treatment period. These data suggest that genetic differences in response to alcohol may be a predictor for some of the behavioral teratogenic effects of alcohol.

N2  - Obesity is epidemic in America. About 80 million Americans are obese, 33.4% of adults and about 20% to 25% of children. Obesity produces morbidity and mortality: there are 300,000 obesity-related deaths annually in America. The definition of obesity has not been standard. Recently, the World Health Organization defined overweight as a body mass index (BMI = kg/m2) of 25 and obesity as a BMI of ≥30. A BMI of ≥35 produces a high risk from obesity and of ≥40 produces a severe risk. The presence of complications of obesity (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, etc.) increases the risk. Treatments of obesity depend on the severity of obesity, the presence of complications, and the absence of exclusions. Exclusions from obesity treatment include pregnancy, lactation, terminal illness, major mental illness, anorexia nervosa. Eating disorders and major medical disorders are strong cautions for obesity treatment. Obesity with a low or modest health risk (BMI: 25-30) is best treated with a diet lower in calories and fat than the current diet, exercise, and lifestyle modification. With obesity that produces a moderate to high health risk (BMI: 30-35), the above treatments plus a very low calorie diet or obesity drugs may be indicated. High and very high health risk due to obesity may be treated with the above regimen plus obesity surgery. In every category of obesity, the presence of complications of obesity increases the risk and justifies more aggressive forms of treatment. Treatment of obesity with drugs has gained acceptance in recent years. There are no absolute indications for drug treatment. Contraindications include pregnancy and lactation, unstable cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension, severe psychiatric disorder or anorexia, and other drug therapy, if incompatible. Cautions include the presence of any severe systemic illness and certain other problems such as closed angle glaucoma. Obesity surgery is reserved as a last resort. Contraindications to surgery and significant mental or physical diseases preclude obesity surgery. Whatever the form of treatment, individualized attention with careful follow-up is mandatory. Obesity is similar to other chronic diseases; if the treatment stops, the disease comes back. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - The purpose of the present study was to identify the incidence of hand symptoms related to pregnancy in a Danish population. Three hundred and thirty-five consecutive postpartum patients were interviewed by questionnaire. Hand symptoms had been noted by 16%, among these 30% described a classic median-nerve symptom distribution (carpal tunnel syndrome) and 24% of patients described an ulnar nerve distribution. Most symptoms were bilateral, commenced in the third trimester and resolved soon after delivery. There was a significant correlation of hand symptoms in pregnancy with the presence of swelling and a significant correlation to parity (first). Hand function and sleep had been disturbed in half of the patients. Half of the patients had mentioned their symptoms to their doctor and one had been sent to treatment. Hand symptoms during pregnancy are common, and their severity is often underestimated. Symptoms of the carpal tunnel syndrome are easily relieved by a night splint.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to describe medical findings and health- related concerns of sexual assault victims who returned for follow-up and to assess demographic and assault characteristics of victims who used follow-up services compared to those who did not. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a retrospective cohort analysis involving records from two sources: the acute sexual assault evidentiary examination and the SAFE (Sexual Assault Follow- up Evaluation) Clinic visit. Data were extracted from the records of 389 adolescent and adult victims who reported an acute sexual assault and underwent a complete evidentiary examination between January 1, 1995, and June 30, 1997. Descriptive statistics were generated on demographic and historical information, assault characteristics, and medical and laboratory findings. For the subgroup that presented for follow-up, additional descriptive statistics were generated to describe their interim history, concerns, medical outcomes, treatments, and psychosocial functioning. χ2 analyses were used to identify differences in the group that returned for follow-up compared with the group that did not. Statistical significance was defined as P < .05. RESULTS: There were no differences in age, race, or perpetrator factors between patients who used follow-up services and patients who did not return to the SAFE Clinic. Similarly, there were no other assault characteristics, relationships, or physical examination findings that were associated with follow-up patterns. A total of 31% (n = 122) of all sexual assault victims returned for a follow-up visit. Physical complaints were reported by 42.6%, but 98.0% had normal findings at a general examination, and 94.8% had a normal result of gynecologic examination. Pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus, were identified through the follow-up clinic. Since the assault, 49.2% had been sexually active, 10% with multiple partners and 73.3% without consistent condom use. Disturbances in sleep, sexual function, and appetite were commonly reported among victims at follow-up. Numerous assault-related fears were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Among recent rape victims, follow-up rates are low, and there are no factors that correlate with the use of follow-up services. Those who do come in for follow-up have physical complaints and health-related concerns that are related to their recent assault, but most have normal physical findings. Efforts to reach sexual assault victims will require aggressive and innovative strategies to remain in contact with women and girls after rape.

N2  - Aims - To analyse the contribution of certain social, familial, prenatal, perinatal, and developmental background factors in the pathogenesis of deficits in attention, motor control, and perception (DAMP). Methods - A population based case-control study was carried out with 113 children aged 6 years, 62 diagnosed with DAMP and 51 controls without DAMP. The children's health and medical records were studied and their history with regard to background factors was taken at an interview with the mother using a standardised schedule. Familial factors, possible non-optimal factors during pregnancy (including smoking), developmental factors (including early language development), and medical and psychosocial data were scored in accordance with the reduced optimality method. Results - Low socioeconomic class was common in the group with DAMP. Familial language disorder and familial motor clumsiness were found at higher rates in the DAMP group. Neuropathogenic risk factors in utero were also more common in the children with DAMP. Maternal smoking during pregnancy appeared to be an important risk factor. Language problems were present in two thirds of the children with DAMP. Sleep problems and gastrointestinal disorders, but not atopy or otitis media, were significantly more common in the DAMP group. Conclusions - Prenatal familial and neuropathogenic risk factors contribute to the development of DAMP. Primary prevention, such as improved maternal health care and early detection or treatment, or both, of associated language problems appear to be essential.

N2  - The effect of infusing the neuroactive steroids pregnanolone and iso- pregnanolone on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and electrocortical (ECoG) activity was studied in unanaesthetised fetal sheep, 130-135 days gestation. Intravenous infusion of pregnanolone (6 mg/kg per h) significantly increased the proportion of high voltage ECoG (56.1 ± 4.8% vs. control 43.5 ± 3.2% P < 0.05), and decreased low voltage ECoG (43.9 ± 4.8% vs. control 56.6 ± 3.2%, P < 0.05). Pregnanolone treatment decreased the amplitude of the N25 peak of the SEP (89.9 ± 2.8% of control, P < 0.05) evoked following stimulation of the skin of the upper lip. In contrast, iso-pregnanolone treatment had no effect on ECoG activities, or on the amplitude and latency of peaks in the SEP. We conclude that 3α-hydroxy pregnane steroids are active at GABA(A) receptors in fetal sheep and can modulate sleep/wake activity before birth.

N2  - A behavioural state transition is the time interval between two different behavioural states. In low-risk fetuses, the fetal heart rate pattern (FHRP) is the first variable to change in transitions from 1F to 2F ('non-REM-sleep' to 'REM-sleep') and the last variable to change in transitions from 2F to 1F. This is not the case in IUGR (intra-uterine growth retardation), and absence of a specific order in which behavioural variables are changing might be an indication for a (mild) disturbance of the fetal central nervous system (CNS). We investigated whether state transitions in twelve low risk term fetuses (39-41 weeks post menstrual age, PMA; control group) differ from those in twelve uncomplicated pregnancies > 41 weeks PMA (study group). All subjects underwent one behavioural study in which fetal heart rate pattern, eye and body movements were recorded simultaneously. We recorded 23 transitions from 1F to 2F and 20 from 2F to 1F. Median (range) duration for transitions from 1F to 2F was 85 (10-180) s in the study group, and 60 (10-180) s in the control group. Transitions from 2F to 1F lasted 80 (10-140) and 60 (30-100) s, respectively. In both groups, the FHRP was the first variable to change in transitions from 1F to 2F, however, in transitions from 2F to 1F, no specific order in change of variables could be demonstrated. We conclude that the study of transitions does not distinguish between the term and after term fetuses under optimal conditions. Whether or not the analysis of state transitions can be used to distinguish 'normal' from 'abnormal' fetuses and detect the fetus at risk after term awaits further study.

N2  - Leptin is a secretory product of adipocytes. It has been suggested that leptin acts as an afferent satiety signal to the brain modulating the expression of the orexigenic hypothalamic peptide, neuropeptide Y (NPY). Therefore leptin can be regarded as a marker of the nutritional status of the body. It was proposed that human obesity may result from a central resistance to leptin due to different pathophysiological mechanisms: saturation of the leptin transport into the cerebrospinal fluid of the obese subjects, abnormalities in the hypothalamic receptor for leptin, or post-receptor transduction mechanisms. It was shown that circulating leptin levels in humans significantly correlate with the body mass index (BMI). Although most studies point to white adipose tissue as a primary source of leptin there is still some uncertainty towards the relative expression of leptin between various body fat compartments. LEPTIN AND ONSET OF PUBERTY: Studies on animal models recognized various metabolic candidates for modulation of GnRH neuronal activity. It was supposed that mild changes in the body's metabolic status can serve to regulate the central drive to the reproductive axis. It is likely that leptin can serve as a "metabolic cue" that transmits signals of those mild metabolic changes towards activation of the GnRH neuronal system at the end of the prepubertal period. On the other side there is a possibility of altered leptin pulsatility during prepubertal period that can consequently influence hypothalamus and GnRH neuronal system. LEPTIN AND SEXUAL DIMORPHISM: Leptin levels in humans are similar in both sexes during the prepubertal period. During puberty leptin has a tendency to decline in boys and to remain constant in girls. Puberty is also characterized with a similar circadian rhythm pattern between sexes whil girls express different pulse characteristics. It seems that sexual dimorphism is established in early phases of human development. There is a possibility of sex steroid influence on such sexual dimorphism. LEPTIN AND REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION: It was shown that administration of recombinant leptin to ob ob mice could restore fertility in these infertile animals. There is certain difference in leptin levels according to the phase of the menstrual cycle. It was shown that leptin peak is in the luteal phase of the cycle and that correlates to the maximal progesterone level. It is possible that leptin could directly influence ovary and that disruption of such an effect could play a role in menstrual irregularities in both obese and mal nourished women. This could even become a pathophysiological mechanism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It was supposed that leptin resistance could be involved in infertility impairment of the obese women with PCOS. Leptin increases during pregnancy. Appearance of placenta as a new, nonadipose source of leptin production, increases a possibility of different leptin mRNA expression through gestation.

N2  - Tenascin-C (TN), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein which reveals both neurite outgrowth-promoting and growth-inhibiting effects, is generated in the central nervous system. A previous study reported that TN-gene null mutant mice display hyperlocomotion and do not easily habituate to unfamiliar environments. Additionally, these mice display poor appetite, abnormal circadian rhythm and low pregnancy rate. The present study demonstrated that neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA expression is reduced in the limbic area of the TN gene-deficient mouse brain as compared to wild-type mice. NPY has been shown to affect emotion, circadian rhythm and food intake, and the present results suggest that the some behavioural abnormalities exhibited by TN-mutant mice may be in part due to the low level of expression of NPY mRNA in the limbic system.

N2  - Obesity is known to increase maternal morbidity and mortality. We describe a case of obstructive sleep apnea due to obesity and discuss our treatment of the resulting pulmonary hypertension. A patient was transferred to our hospital at 29 weeks' gestation with severe anasarca and more than a 100-pound weight gain during pregnancy. Pulmonary hypertension due to obstructive sleep apnea was diagnosed. The patient was treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep and remained in the hospital the remainder of her pregnancy. She had a massive spontaneous diuresis during her hospital stay and lost more than 100 pounds. She was delivered at term via cesarean section because of transverse lie. Preoperative hemodynamic monitoring confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. This represents the first case in the literature of obstructive sleep apnea leading to pulmonary hypertension in pregnancy. This patient responded well to nasal CPAP as evident by the massive diuresis and good maternal outcome.

N2  - Stimulating cardiac β1-adrenoceptors with oxyfedrine causes dilatation of coronary vessels and positive inotropic effects on the myocardium. β1-adrenergic agonists increase coronary blood flow in nonstenotic and stenotic vessels. The main indication for the use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors pamrinone, mirinone, enoximone and piroximone is acute treatment of severe congestive heart failure. Theophylline is indicated for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, apnea in preterm infants ans sleep apnea syndrome. Severe arterial occlusive disease associated with atherosclerosis can be beneficially affected by elcosanoids. These drugs must be administered parenterally and have a half-life of only a few minutes. Sublingual or buccal preparations of nitrates are the only prompt method (within 1 or 2 min) of terminating anginal pain, except for biting nifedipine capsules. The short half-life (about 2.5 min) of nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) makes long term therapy impossible. Tolerance is a problem encountered with longer-acting nitric oxide donors. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of vasodilating drugs can prevent a too sudden and severe blood pressure decrease in patients with chronic hypertension. In considering the administration of a second dose, or another drug, the time necessary for the initially administered drug to reach maximal efficacy should be taken into account. In hypertensive emergencies urapidil, sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, hydralazine and phentolamine are the drugs of choice, with the addition of β-blockers during catecholamine crisis or dissecting aortic aneurysm. Childhood hypertension is most often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium antagonists, primarily nifedipine. Because of the teratogenic risk involved with ACE inhibitors, extreme caution must be exercised when prescribing for adolescent females. The propagation of health benefits to breast-fed infants, combined with more women delaying pregnancy until their fourth decade, has entailed an increase in the need fur hypertension management during lactation. Low dose hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, nifendipine and enalapril or captopril do not pose enough of a risk to preclude breastfeeding in this group. The most frequently used antihypertensive agents during pregnancy are methyldopa, labetalol and calcium channel antagonists. Methyldopa and β-blockers are the drugs of choice for treating mild to moderate hypertension. Prazosin and hydralazine are used to treat moderate to severe hypertension and hydralazine, urapidil or labetalol are used to treat hypertensive emergencies. The use of overly aggressive antihypertensive therapy during pregnancy should be avoided so that adequate uteroplacental blood flow is maintained. Methyldopa is the only drug accepted for use during the first trimester of pregnancy.

N2  - A prospective study documented the nutritional intakes of a large cohort of pregnant women living in Portsmouth and investigated the independent relationships of smoking, dietary intake and other maternal socio-economic factors on outcome and cardiorespiratory function of the child during sleep at home at three weeks and three months of age. Unattended overnight cardiorespiratory recording was performed and the data stored in local memory before transmission on demand via modem to Oxford next morning. The telemetry of the physiological data, entirely managed by part-time community nurses in Portsmouth, was very successful. Despite some losses, which included transmission failures, electrode or lead disconnection, and monitor malfunction, 92% of the physiological data were analysed at Oxford. Personalized physiological monitoring in the community provides an opportunity for new evidence bases that will enable a new level of individualized care.

N2  - Objective: To determine whether problems with childhood sleep behaviour are associated with either maternal sleep patterns and emotional status during the pregnancy period, or levels of maternal distress and depression during the postnatal period. Methodology: A case/control comparison study. Cases were families presenting for admissions to a mother/baby hospital in Brisbane with the major presenting problem being the child's sleep behaviour. The control group consisted of families presenting for well child health care to one of four child health centers in suburban Brisbane. Each participating mother provided information by way of a self-report questionnaire on social and demographic variables, children's sleep patterns, maternal emotional adjustment and maternal sleep pattern during the pregnancy, and current problem with child's sleep behaviour. Current level of maternal distress/depression, was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Cases were compared with controls on all these variables. Results: Significant differences were found between groups in childhood sleep parameters, degree of problem related to childhood sleep, maternal sleep variables during the entire pregnancy, and current levels of maternal distress/depression. Conclusion: The origins of problematic childhood sleep behaviour may lie in the pregnancy period. Levels of maternal distress and depression are associated with problematic childhood sleep behaviour. The issue of whether childhood sleep problem predisposes to maternal distress/depression needs exploration. Assessment of maternal mood disorder or childhood sleep problems should be comprehensive and involve both the maternal infant dyad and the family network.
