AB  - Objective:Sleep complaints are clinically expected in children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. We aim to reveal patterns of association among sleep–wake behaviors that are challenging in the life of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods:Through text-mining analyses, we numericized the transcripts of 59 caregiver’s informal, conversational interviews. That is, the relative frequencies-of-occurrences of words as well as their semantic specificities (italic) were clustered, categorized, and visualized for patterns. Results:A total of 4008 words were indexed wheresleeptook the 91st place of most important words.Sleepandwakewere however not associatively conversed throughout the interviews. Sleep-related words conversed were:night, nap, apnea, asleep, awake, bed, bedroom, bedtime, mattress, melatonin, overnight, andwake-up. Among some FASD-characteristic words describing the challenges were:huge, alcohol, manage*, stop, adopt, crazy*. The semantic space reflecting these challenges experienced in caring for children with FASD was divided into two axes: child-oriented vs. other-oriented words, and day-related and night-related words. The position of sleep shows that problematic sleep was expressed as a ‘family’ issue. Clumsy* was interrelated with problematic sleeping and waking. Despite that mostlynightwas associatively conversed, the association ofRoutines,Managing, andPlanningwithsleepunderscores the challenges faced. Conclusion:When conversing caregivers of children with FASD seldom interrelate ‘sleep’ but rather ‘night’ with FASD-characteristics. Increased sleep awareness combined with educational initiatives regarding sleep are advocated.

AB  - Background: Poor sleep quality, dysregulation of hormones and increased inflammatory cytokines are all associated with the risk for postpartum major depression (PPMD). We evaluated change over time in sleep quality and hormones during the first 17 weeks postpartum, as well as a single cytokine measure, and their association with PPMD recurrence.Methods: Participants were pregnant women (N=56), with past histories of MDD/PPMD but not depressed in their current pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and blood samples were collected 8 times during the first 17 weeks postpartum. Estradiol, prolactin and cortisol, and a single measure of IL-6 were assayed. Recurrence was determined by two consecutive 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores≥15 and clinician interview.Results: In the analyses of time to PPMD recurrence, poor sleep quality, but none of the hormones, was associated with PPMD recurrence (p<.05) after controlling for medication assignment. With every one point increase in PSQI scores across time, a woman's risk for recurrence increased by approximately 25% There was no significant association between PSQI scores and IL-6 concentrations in early postpartum (χ(2)=0.98, p=.32).Conclusions: Poor sleep quality across the first 17 weeks post-delivery increases the risk for recurrent PPMD among women with a history of MDD. Changes in the hormonal milieu were not associated with recurrence. Further exploration of the degree to which poor sleep contributes to hormonal and cytokine dysregulation and how they are involved in the pathophysiology of PPMD is warranted.

AB  - Background:Although incident snoring is common in pregnant women and has been proposed as a potential risk factor for adverse maternalfetal outcomes, the development of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy has not been prospectively described.Methods:Using the Apnea Symptom Score from the Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, we prospectively assessed symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing and daytime somnolence in 155 women to determine whether symptoms increased during pregnancy and the characteristics associated with increasing symptoms.Results:We found that sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (Apnea Symptom Score, 0.44 (SEM 0.58) vs 0.95 (0.09, P < .001) and the degree of daytime somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 8.6 (0.3) vs 10.2 (0.4), P = .0003) increased significantly during pregnancy. Women with higher baseline body mass indexes and greater increases in neck circumference during pregnancy reported higher apnea symptom scores. Of the 155 subjects, 11.4% reported an increase in Apnea Symptom Score of 2 units or more, consistent with a clinically significant increase in symptoms; these women experienced a significantly greater increase in subjective sleepiness than other subjects (P = .03). Excessive daytime somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale > 10) was prevalent throughout pregnancy (31.0%-45.5%).Conclusions:Our data demonstrate that symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing increase during pregnancy and that more than 10% of our subjects may be at risk for developing sleep apnea during pregnancy. Excessive daytime somnolence was highly prevalent even early in pregnancy and became increasingly common as pregnancy progressed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cohort study was to prospectively assess frequency, characteristics, and determinants of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy and its impact on sleep. METHODS: Pregnant women were prospectively studied in each trimester and 8 weeks postpartum. Assessments included interview about RLS symptoms and sleep disturbances; standardized sleep-wake questionnaires including the International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale (IRLSS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI); actigraphic recording of periodic limb movements (PLM); and blood tests including levels of hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen. RESULTS: RLS was diagnosed in 58 of 501 women (12%). Positive family history was found in 37% of women with RLS; 59% reported onset of RLS symptoms before the 20th week; 45% had an IRLSS >20 and 100% had a PSQI >5. Hemoglobin levels <11 g/dL were found in 20% of both affected and unaffected women in the third trimester. Women with and without RLS had similar hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen levels. IRLSS and PLM in sleep dropped by more than 50% postpartum in women with RLS. CONCLUSION: We found lower prevalence and earlier onset of symptoms compared to previous studies and confirmed significant improvement after delivery. RLS is clinically relevant due to severe impact on sleep quality. Genetic factors and smoking, but not ferritin, anemia, or estrogen levels, seem to play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS in pregnancy.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether maternal mental health mediates the relationship between eczema or asthma symptoms and mental well-being in children.Study Design: Analysis of 7250 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Child mental well-being at 8 years was measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Binary outcomes were high 'internalizing' (anxious/depressive) and 'externalizing' (oppositional/hyperactive) problems (high was >90th percentile). Child rash and wheeze categories were 'none'; 'early onset transient' (infancy/preschool only); 'persistent' (infancy/preschool and at school age); and 'late onset' (school age only). Maternal anxiety and depression were reported during pregnancy and when child was 8 years old.Results: Persistent wheezing symptoms were associated with high externalizing (OR 1.74, 95% CI, 1.41-2.15) and internalizing (1.67, 1.35-2.06) problems compared with never wheeze. Maternal anxiety and depression, and disrupted child sleep, attenuated these associations. Persistent rash (externalizing: 1.74, 1.40-2.15; internalizing: 1.42, 1.16-1.74) and late onset rash (externalizing: 1.62, 1.17-2.25; internalizing: 1.46, 1.07-1.99) symptoms were associated with poorer mental well-being compared with no rash at any age. Maternal anxiety and depression, particularly when child was aged 8 years rather than during pregnancy, accounted for the association with internalizing symptoms and partly for externalizing symptoms. Sleep disruption did not mediate the association.Conclusions: Maternal anxiety and depression may mediate the association between child rash and wheeze and child mental well-being.

AB  - Objective: To explore women's levels of childbirth fear, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and fatigue and their relationships during the third trimester of pregnancy. Design: A cross-sectional descriptive survey of a community sample. Participants: Six hundred and fifty English-speaking nulliparous and multiparous women, 17 to 46 years of age and between 35 and 39 weeks gestation, with uncomplicated pregnancies. Methods: Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Mindell's Sleep Questionnaire, and the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Questionnaire. Results: Twenty-five percent of women reported high levels of childbirth fear and 20.6% reported sleeping less than 6 hours per night. Childbirth fear, fatigue, sleep deprivation, and anxiety were positively correlated. Fewer women attending midwives reported severe fear of childbirth than those attending obstetricians. Women with high childbirth fear were more likely to have more daily stressors, anxiety, and fatigue, as well as less help. Higher levels of anxiety predicted higher levels of childbirth fear among women. Conclusion: One fourth of women reported high childbirth fear. Women's fear of childbirth was related to fatigue, available help, stressors, and anxiety. Fear of childbirth appears to be part of a complex picture of women's emotional experiences during pregnancy.

AB  - Objectives: Childhood abuse is associated with increased risks of adult psychiatric disorders and physical health conditions. Mounting evidence documents associations of childhood abuse with sleep disturbances in adulthood. However, to date, no study has evaluated associations of childhood abuse and sleep disturbances among pregnant women.Methods: This cross-sectional study included 634 pregnant Peruvian women. To collect information regarding socio-demographic characteristics, history of childhood abuse, and complaints of sleep disturbances, face-to-face interviews were conducted with women in early pregnancy. Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST-S) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-S), translated from English to Spanish, were used to assess stress-related sleep disturbance and sleep quality, respectively. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).Results: Women who experienced any childhood abuse had a 1.65-fold increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.15-2.38) and 2.11-fold increased odds of poor sleep quality during early pregnancy (aOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.35-3.30) as compared with women who reported no abuse. Women who reported both physical and sexual abuse during childhood were more than twice as likely to suffer from stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.44-3.53) and poor sleep quality (aOR = 2.43; 95% CI: 1.45-4.09) in comparison to women who reported no childhood abuse.Conclusions: A history of childhood abuse is associated with increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance and poor sleep quality during pregnancy. These findings, if replicated, should be used to inform the development of trauma-informed care for such sleep disturbances induced by childhood trauma.

AB  - Background Available evidence from cross-sectional studies suggests that childhood maltreatment may be associated with a range of sleep disorders. However, these studies have not controlled for potential individual-, familial- and environmental-level confounders. Aim To determine the association between childhood maltreatment and lower sleep quality after adjusting for potential confounders. Methods Data for the present study were obtained from a pre-birth cohort study of 3778 young adults (52.6% female) of the Mater Hospital-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy follow up at a mean age of 20.6 years. The Mater Hospital-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy is a prospective Australian pre-birth cohort study of mothers consecutively recruited during their first obstetric clinic visit at Brisbane's Mater Hospital in 1981-1983. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at the 21-year follow up. We linked this dataset to agency-recorded substantiated cases of childhood maltreatment. A series of separate logistic regression models was used to test whether childhood maltreatment predicted lower sleep quality after adjustment for selected confounders. Results Substantiated physical abuse significantly predicted lower sleep quality in males. Single and multiple forms of childhood maltreatment, including age of maltreatment and number of substantiations, did not predict lower sleep quality in either gender in both crude and adjusted models. Not being married, living in a residential problem area, cigarette smoking and internalising were significantly associated with lower sleep quality in a fully adjusted model for the male-female combined sample. Conclusions Childhood maltreatment does not appear to predict young adult poor sleep quality, with the exception of physical abuse for males. While childhood maltreatment has been found to predict a range of mental health problems, childhood maltreatment does not appear to predict sleep problems occurring in young adults. Poor sleep quality was accounted for by concurrent social disadvantage, cigarette smoking and internalising.

AB  - Question: What is the relation between acute and chronic life stressors and susceptibility to the common cold? Design: Cohort study in which participants were given a low infectious dose of rhinovirus (type RV39 or Hanks) and quarantined for 1 day before and 5 days after exposure. Setting: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. Participants: 276 people (55% women, 81% white) aged 18-55 years who responded to a newspaper advertisement and were free of disease (based on examination and laboratory testing). Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, currently lactating, or on regular medication. Assessment of risk factors: Acute and chronic life stressors based on scores from the Bedford College Life Events and Diffculties Schedule. Acute events lasted < 1 month and were a marked or moderate long term threat (eg, getting reprimanded at work). Chronic stressors lasted >/= 1 month, did not end > 6 months before assessment, and were a high moderate or marked long term threat (eg, ongoing unemployment); chronic physical illness stressors were not included. Other variables included health practices (smoking, exercise, sleep habits, alcohol use, and vitamin C and zinc intake), endocrine and immune function, social network ties, personality characteristics, and control variables (age, sex, race, education, body mass, baseline antibody levels, season, and virus type). Main outcome measures: Main outcome was having a cold, based on objective criteria for infection (isolation of virus or changes in serum antibody levels) and illness (mucous weights or mucociliary nasal clearance). Main results: 84% of participants showed evidence of infection, but only 40% had colds. 179 participants (65%) had >/=1 acute event in the previous year and 75 participants (27%) had chronic stressors. Analyses adjusted for control variables showed that participants who had chronic stressors in the previous year were more likely to get colds than those who did not (table); participants who had acute events in the previous year were not more likely to get colds (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 950/0 CI 0.76 to 2.55). Certain health practices (smoking, exercising </= 2 times/wk, poor sleep efficiency, </= 1 alcoholic drink/d, </= 85 mg vitamin C/d), hormone concentrations (increased norepinephrine concentrations), personality factors (introversion), and social network ties (low network diversity) were also associated with an increased risk of colds. The relation between chronic stressors and colds persisted after controlling separately for health practices, endocrine and immune markers, personality, and social network diversity (table). Conclusion: People who had chronic severe life stressors lasting >/= 1 month had increased susceptibility to colds compared with people who did not have chronic life stressors, but people who had acute stressful life events in the previous year did not have increased susceptibility.

AB  - Introduction: Women of child-bearing age are the population at greatest risk for depression. The stress experienced during pregnancy and the associated antidepressant treatments can both affect fetal development. Fluoxetine (FLX) is among the most common antidepressants used by pregnant women. We have previously demonstrated that perinatal exposure to FLX can alter expression of circadian rhythms in adulthood. Here, we examine the combined effects of maternal stress during pregnancy and perinatal exposure to the antidepressant FLX on the circadian behavior of mice as adults. Methods: Mouse dams were exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (embryonic (E) day 7 to E18), FLX (E15 to postnatal day 12), a combination of both stress and FLX, or were left untreated. At 2 months of age, male offspring were placed in recording chambers and circadian organization of wheel running rhythms and phase shifts to photic and non-photic stimuli were assessed. Results: Mice exposed to prenatal stress (PS) had smaller light-induced phase delays. Mice exposed to perinatal FLX required more days to re-entrainment to an 8-h phase advance of their light-dark cycle. Mice subjected to either perinatal FLX or to PS had larger light-induced phase advances and smaller phase advances to 8-OH-DPAT. FLX treatment partially reversed the effect of PS on phase shifts to late-night light exposure and to 8-OH-DPAT. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, in mice, perinatal exposure to either FLX, or PS, or their combination, leads to discernible, persistent changes in their circadian systems as adults.

AB  - Introduction: The circadian clock plays an important role in several aspects of female reproductive biology. Evidence linking circadian clock-related genes to pregnancy outcomes has been inconsistent. We sought to examine whether variations in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of circadian clock genes are associated with PA risk. Methods: Maternal blood samples were collected from 470 PA case and 473 controls. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Cardio-MetaboChip platform. We examined 119 SNPs in 13 candidate genes known to control circadian rhythms (e.g., CRY2, ARNTL, and RORA). Univariate and penalized logistic regression models were fit to estimate odds ratios (ORs); and the combined effect of multiple SNPs on PA risk was estimated using a weighted genetic risk score (wGRS). Results: A common SNP in the RORA gene (rs2899663) was associated with a 21% reduced odds of PA (P < 0.05). The odds of PA increased with increasing wGRS (Ptrend < 0.001). The corresponding ORs were 1.00, 1.83, 2.81 and 5.13 across wGRS quartiles. Participants in the highest wGRS quartile had a 5.13-fold (95% confidence interval: 3.21-8.21) higher odds of PA compared to those in the lowest quartile. Although the test for interaction was not significant, the odds of PA was substantially elevated for preeclamptics with the highest wGRS quartile (OR = 14.44, 95%CI: 6.62-31.53) compared to normotensive women in the lowest wGRS quartile. Discussion: Genetic variants in circadian rhythm genes may be associated with PA risk. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings and to further elucidate the pathogenesis of this important obstetrical complication.

AB  - Kisspeptin is an essential gatekeeper of reproductive function. During pregnancy high circulating levels of kisspeptin have been described, however the clear role of this neuropeptide in pregnancy remains unknown. We tested the existence of rhythmic kisspeptin expression in human full-term placenta from healthy pregnant women at six different time points during the day. The data obtained by Western blotting were fitted to a mathematical model (Fourier series), demonstrating, for the first time, the existence of a circadian rhythm in placental kisspeptin expression.

AB  - Background: Perinatal changes in maternal sleep patterns may modify circadian phase. Our objectives were to (a) measure changes in circadian phase and phase angle between salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and sleep onset across the perinatal period; and (b) prospectively examine associations between circadian measures and depressed mood in women with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD).Methods: Twelve women (age±SD=26.9±5 years) who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) were studied from third trimester of pregnancy through postpartum week 6. Participants completed sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs and light sensors, and had mood assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) during 3 separate weeks of the perinatal period; they gave saliva samples at 33 weeks gestation and 6 weeks postpartum to determine DLMO phase.Results: Nine women had DLMO phase shifts ≥30 min. On average±SD, new mothers phase delayed 42±80 min (range=163 min phase delay to 144 min phase advance). The time interval between average actigraphic sleep onset and DLMO was shorter at 6 weeks postpartum compared to 3rd trimester in 9 of 12 women, indicating that most new mothers were going to bed closer to the onset of endogenous melatonin secretion. Circadian measures were associated with depressed mood at postpartum weeks 2 and 6.Limitations: These data are preliminary findings from a small sample and require replication.Conclusions: We observed individual differences in magnitude and direction of circadian phase shifts and their timing relative to sleep across the perinatal period. These measures were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms. These preliminary data indicate that changes in perinatal circadian rhythms may contribute to the development of postpartum mood disorders.

AB  - Pregnancy is a complex and well-regulated temporal event in which several steps are finely orchestrated including implantation, decidualization, placentation, and partum and any temporary alteration has serious effects on fetal and maternal health. Interestingly, alterations of circadian rhythms (i.e., shiftwork) have been correlated with increased risk of preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, and preeclampsia. In the last few years evidence is accumulating that the placenta may have a functional circadian system and express the clock genes Bmal1, Per1-2, and Clock. On the other hand, there is evidence that the human placenta synthesizes melatonin, hormone involved in the regulation of the circadian system in other tissues. Moreover, is unknown the role of this local production of melatonin and whether this production have a circadian pattern. Available information indicates that melatonin induces in placenta the expression of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, prevents the injury produced by oxidative stress, and inhibits the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) a gene that in other tissues is controlled by clock genes. In this review we aim to analyze available information regarding clock genes and clock genes controlled genes such as VEGF and the possible role of melatonin synthesis in the placenta.

AB  - Several studies attempted to evaluate the predictive value or the associated risk of several factors only on generic sleep disorders and mainly night-wakings. Aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of biological and historical and clinical factors on the different aspect of sleep behavior and disturbances evaluated by the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Mothers of 1157 children (583 M, 574 F) aged 6.5 to 15.3 years (mean 9.8) completed the SDSC together with a questionnaire on demographic data about family composition, parent's education and professional activities, as well as clinical data about pregnancy, delivery and medical history of the child with specific questions regarding pathologies that could affect sleep; sleep habits of parents and children were also investigated. Global sleep disturbances measured as SDSC total score were affected by cc sleeping, early sleep disorders, adenotonsillitis, asthma and parents' sleep disorders. Early sleep disorders, asthma and parents' sleep disorders had a significant main effect on disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep. Sleep breathing disorders score was associated with the presence of cosleeping, adenotonsillitis, asthma, food allergy. Disorders of Arousal score was affected by early sleep disorders and parents' sleep disorders. There was a significant main effect of co-sleeping, early sleep disorder, adenotonsillitis, parents' sleep disorder on sleep-wake transition disorders score; of gender, parents' sleep disorder on Disorders of excessive somnolence score and of gender, early sleep disorder and parents' sleep disorder on Sleep hyperhydrosis score. Post-hoc comparisons showed that females vs. males have higher scores in Disorders of excessive somnolence score while males scored higher in Sleep hyperhydrosis score. A visual generalized model revealed that predictors for Total SDSC score are early sleep disorders, parents' sleep disorders, adenotonsillitis and asthma. Our results underline the role of genetic and neurobiological substrate on the development of children sleep, delineating the areas of the sleep that are involved and rising some suggestions on which factors could lead to different later sleep disturbances.

AB  - A 4-year-old girl who had been born of normal pregnancy and delivery and had an unremarkable family or personal history was referred to a neuropsychiatric department because of the appearance of peculiar nocturnal episodes. Parents described that their child abruptly became stiff during sleep. These episodes usually ranged from 20 to 40 seconds, and after that the child continued to sleep. Initially she presented 1 episode per week, but there was a progressive increase in frequency up to 3 to 4 times per night. The child never presented similar episodes while awake. Her examination revealed some café-au-lait spots, congenital microcephaly (3rd centile) and low stature for the age (10th centile). She did not present any neurologic deficit, but she failed to develop an age-appropriate speech, with a delay in the main language milestones.

AB  - While the prevalence of bipolar disorder is roughly equal in women and men, the course of illness tends to be more severe in women. In 50% of women with bipolar disorder, illness onset occurs at or within 1 year of menarche. Despite this pattern, most women with bipolar disorder are not accurately diagnosed until they have had a child and developed an episode of PPD. The occurrence of PPD in a patient with recurrent depression but no history of mania or hypomania should raise the index of suspicion for the presence of an underlying bipolar disorder. Medications used in the treatment of bipolar disorder can result in side effects, such as sexual dysfunction or weight gain, and in drug-drug interactions. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptive pills while sodium valproate may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is the most common cause of menstrual disturbance in women of reproductive age. Contrary to popular belief, pregnancy does not protect against bipolar disorder relapse. Thus, physicians must be proactive in protecting the mother from relapse. In general, physicians should use nonpharmacologic measures as much as possible, pharmacology when necessary, and consider electroconvulsive therapy when the risks of medications are too great. Psychotic, floridly manic, or profoundly depressed patients should be given medication, for which information concerning safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding exist. For less severe problems, nonpharmacologic strategies can be employed and include promoting the maintenance of healthy nutrition and activity, protecting social and activity/sleep rhythms, educating patients and their families on how to recognize a prodrome of illness, and the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy to address mild symptoms of anxiety, depression, or substance abuse.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the physiological stability and behavioral effects of co-bedding with those of single-bedding premature multiple-gestation infants in incubators as well as the psychological effects on their parents. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, repeated measure. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 16 infants and 8 parents in the co-bedded group, and 21 infants and 11 parents in the control group. INTERVENTIONS: Infants in the study group were co-bedded in incubators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline and posttesting for parental state anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction measures; infant sleep-wake synchronicity; physiological measures; and stress cue measures during baseline and activity. MAIN RESULTS: Repeated measures 5 (time) x 2 (group) analysis of variance found significant differences in infant daily weight, feeding amount, and high-activity heart rate. There was no difference in parental state anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction scores by group, except for higher baseline parental satisfaction scores in the co-bedded group. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated the safety of co-bedding multiple-gestation infants in incubators but did not find any significant clinical improvement in infant or parental outcomes with co-bedding. Neonatal intensive-care unit providers should educate staff and parents about the potential benefits of co-bedding and consider developing policies and procedures for co-bedding in both incubators and cribs. Co-bedding of multiple-gestation infants may be provided as an adjunctive developmental care strategy if parents desire this intervention.

AB  - This study was part of a large departmental performance improvement initiative to implement and evaluate developmental and family-centered care as 'best practice' in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The goal was to evaluate the safety, effect on infant clinical and developmental outcomes, and maternal satisfaction of co-bedding of multiple-gestation infants compared to traditionally bedded infants/mothers. A secondary purpose was to evaluate co-bedding and American Academy of Pediatrics-recommended 'back to sleep' behaviors in the same infants/mothers after discharge. A retrospective, comparative, descriptive design was used. Chart reviews and mailed written surveys were used to collect study data. Findings showed no significant differences in demographic variables or clinical and developmental outcomes between the total traditionally bedded and co-bedded groups. All mothers reported positive experiences with the NICU. Co-bedding may promote maternal bonding and has no negative clinical or developmental outcomes. Once policies and education are in place, parents should be offered the option to co-bed multiple-gestation infants in the NICU. There is a performance improvement opportunity regarding the education provided to parents of multiple-gestation infants before discharge on the 'back to sleep' recommendations.

AB  - SYNOPSIS: Sleep was monitored in five primiparous women in a laboratory setting every 2 months during pregnancy and at 1 month postpartum. Only the first 6 hours of sleep were analyzed. As predicted from theory about the restorative function of sleep, deep sleep (stages 3-4, slow-wave, delta sleep) increased significantly during the third trimester compared to the first trimester. No difference was found in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep across time. Wake time was significantly higher at the postpartum phase compared to the first trimester.

AB  - SYNOPSIS: The purpose of this study was to describe maternal-infant bonding in homeless parenting adolescents who were participating in a residential program for homeless pregnant and parenting adolescents and their infants. The Capable Adolescent Mothers (CAM) program is focused on helping adolescents who plan to keep and raise their children, who show a readiness for taking responsibility, and who are currently drug free to become capable in parenting skills, life skills, and job skills. Seventeen primarily African-American (n = 11) adolescents between the ages of 15 and 18 years, were videotaped during 34 infant-feeding episodes. The videotapes were analyzed using Barnard's Nursing Child Assessment Feeding Scale and compared to a national normative sample (NCAST scores). The CAM group scores (41.9) compared favorably to the NCAST scores (41.6) on the parent scale (sensitivity to cues, response to distress, social-emotional, and cognitive growth fostering). The CAM group child scores (clarity of cues, responsiveness to parent) were significantly lower than the NCAST group's scores, probably reflecting the expected lower response scores for infants compared to older children. The author also described the three adolescents who had low total scores and the three who had high total scores. Additionally, as a group, the adolescents did not seem to have a good sense of time; they had not developed routine times for feeding, sleep, and play.

AB  - SYNOPSIS: The purpose of this study was to examine the safety of providing mothers 'kangaroo care' (skin-to-skin contact) with their premature infants and to measure maternal emotional reactions to this care. The convenience sample consisted of eight mother-infant pairs. At the initiation of the study, the infants ranged from 1,250 to 1,750 g, were born at 24 to 32 weeks gestation, were not on ventilator assistance, and were physiologically stable. Mothers spent a minimum of 4 hours each day holding their infants upright between their breasts, skin-to-skin. Physiologic monitoring demonstrated no significant changes in apnea, heart rate, or oxygen saturation during these sessions. Time spent in sleep and skin temperature were lower for the infant during kangaroo care but changes were not deemed clinically significant. The cognitive adaptation framework used to categorize maternal responses identified common expressions of helplessness, lack of control, and guilt during the first week after delivery. All mothers experienced an emotional crisis during the second week. By Week 3, mothers expressed increased comfort and control over their environment. All mothers reported that the experience of kangaroo care helped them to gain a sense of control and competency. The authors concluded that skin-to-skin contact activated a process of reconciliation and healing. [Original article accession number: 1993163240 (research, tables/charts)]

AB  - Sleep disorders, prevalent in industrialized countries, are associated with adverse health outcomes such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is frequently overlooked by health care providers, yet recent studies suggest there is an association between sleep disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, elevated serum glucose, depression, prolonged labor, and cesarean birth. Growing evidence indicates that the recognition and management of prenatal sleep disorders may minimize adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve maternal and fetal well-being. This focused review of prenatal sleep disturbance literature suggests there are 3 main sleep disorders of interest: breathing-related sleep disorders (ie, habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnea), restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. These sleep disorders are common in pregnancy and have maternal and fetal consequences if left untreated. This article describes sleep disorders of pregnancy, elucidates their relationship with maternal and neonatal outcomes, and presents current evidence regarding diagnostic and management strategies.

AB  - The effects of comorbid depression and anxiety were compared to the effects of depression alone and anxiety alone on pregnancy mood states and biochemistry and on neonatal outcomes in a large multi-ethnic sample. At the prenatal period the comorbid and depressed groups had higher scores than the other groups on the depression measure. But, the comorbid group had higher anxiety, anger and daily hassles scores than the other groups, and they had lower dopamine levels. As compared to the non-depressed group, they also reported more sleep disturbances and relationship problems. The comorbid group also experienced a greater incidence of prematurity than the depressed, the high anxiety and the non-depressed groups. Although the comorbid and anxiety groups were lower birthweight than the non-depressed and depressed groups, the comorbid group did not differ from the depressed and anxiety groups on birth length. The neonates of the comorbid and depressed groups had higher cortisol and norepinephrine and lower dopamine and serotonin levels than the neonates of the anxiety and non-depressed groups as well as greater relative right frontal EEG. These data suggest that for some measures comorbidity of depression and anxiety is the worst condition (e.g., incidence of prematurity), while for others, comorbidity is no more impactful than depression alone.

AB  - Objective: To compare self-reported safe sleep data from a community social service agency and primary care centers. Design, Settings, and Participants: Cross-sectional Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)–based survey data from a community social service agency and survey data from primary care centers were compared using descriptive statistics. There were 166 community survey respondents, average age of 25 years (SD = 5.4 years), and 79 primary care center respondents, average age of 24 years (SD = 5.4 years). Two binary logistic regressions were performed to examine the association between demographic differences and safe sleep position/bed sharing. Results: Safe sleep position responses did not differ significantly between the community-based (n = 126, 85%) and primary care center–based (n = 62, 79%) samples, χ2(1) = 0.79, P = .372. Reported bed sharing was significantly higher in the community sample (n = 54, 36%) than the health care center sample (n = 4, 5%), Fisher’s exact test, P< .001. Black race was determined to be significantly associated with increased unsafe sleep positioning (OR = 2.86, P = .022). The community center cohort was the only significant predictor of bed sharing (OR = 25.40, P = .002). Conclusion:Differences in reported safe sleep environments may be due to knowledge variances of safe sleep guidelines, or clinic-based respondents may have been more likely to provide socially desirable responses. The comparison data further highlight the need for continued targeted effort to improve safe sleep behaviors to improve infant health outcomes.

AB  - Background: This study was designed to compare the effects of fluoxetine and imipramine on fasting blood glucose (FBG) in patients with major depressive disorder.Methods: Non-diabetic patients, with major depressive disorder (based on DSM-IV criteria) entered this randomized, double-blind study. Patients did not receive any medication affecting serum FBG levels at least for 2 weeks prior to the initiation of the study. Patients were assigned to receive 20 to 40 mg/day of fluoxetine or 75 to 200 mg/day of imipramine for 8 weeks. Benzodiazepines were allowed when needed for anxiety, agitation or sleep. Pregnant women, and patients with diabetes mellitus, and history of major heart diseases were excluded from this study. Additionally, none of the patients should have received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) within 6 months prior to initiation of the antidepressants. FBG levels were measured at the initiation of study as well as 4 and 8 weeks after starting antidepressants.Results: Nineteen patients in the fluoxetine and 24 patients in the imipramine groups completed the study. In the fluoxetine group, FBG level was decreased from 88.5 mg/dL (baseline) to 85.0 mg/dL at week 4 (P=0.73), and to 79.8mg/dL at week 8 (P<0.001). On the other hand, in the imipramine group, FBG level was increased from 86.96 mg/dL (baseline) to 89.71 mg/dL at week 4 (P=0.079), and to 96.90 mg/dL at week 8 (P<0.001).Conclusion: This 8-weeks study showed that FBG levels may decrease in depressive patients receiving fluoxetine and may increase in those patients treated with imipramine. Therefore, it is suggested to measure and monitor FBG before initiation and during treatment with fluoxetine and imipramine. This abstract was translated into English by the publisher or author.

AB  - Background: Quality of sleep disorder is a common problem during pregnancy. Training based on continuous care model and telehealth has improved the quality of health care and may also ameliorate quality of sleep. Aim: The present study was conducted to compare the effects of training on the quality of sleep in pregnant women on the basis of continuous care model and telehealth. Method: This three-group clinical trial was performed in 2017 on 91 pregnant women visiting health centers in Mashhad, Iran. Orientation, sensitization, control and evaluation were carried out in the continuous care group, and four DVDs were watched by mothers in the telehealth group over the course of four weeks along with eight weeks of follow-up, and the routine care of health centers was administered for the control group. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was completed at the end of weeks 8 and 12 after the start of the study. Data were analyzed in SPSS version 24 using Kruskal-Wallis statistical test. Results: The three groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic variables (P<0.05). The Kruskal-Wallis test results showed that the mean quality of sleep score before the intervention was homogeneous among the three groups (P=0.42), but it was significantly different (P<0.001) immediately after the intervention in the three groups of continuous care (4.4±1.7), telehealth (4.4±1.4), and control (9.0±3.7), and there was a significant difference four weeks post-intervention in the three groups of continuous care (3.5±2.1), telehealth (5.3±1.8), and control (10.7±3.1) (P<0.001). Implications for Practice: Training based on the continuous care model and telehealth can improve the quality of sleep in pregnant women. Considering that telehealth is a simpler and easier method, it can be used to boost the quality of sleep in pregnant women.

AB  - Pregnancy is accompanied by several haemodynamic, biochemical and haematological changes, which may lead to severe problems, if they are not suitably addressed. The current study highlights the haematological and biochemical differences observed in anaemic (AP) and non-anaemic primigravida (NAP), in the 2nd trimester, in a north Indian population. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the body weight and body temperature of NAP compared with AP. A significant decrease (p < 0.001) in haematological parameters including haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocyte count, MCH and MCHC, was observed in AP; however, MCV was found to be significantly higher (p = 0.038). Many biochemical parameters viz. potassium, albumin, total protein and calcium levels were significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in AP, except alkaline phosphatase whose level was found significantly increased (p < 0.01). The findings of the study suggest that haematological and biochemical changes take place in anaemia during pregnancy. Further, the results obtained should be used for establishing normative values for similar populations.

AB  - Objectives: Pregnant women report disturbed sleep, including habitual snoring and insomnia. The co-occurrence among non-pregnant cohorts is 30%-50% with increased risk for adverse health outcomes. To date, no study has examined the comorbid status or impact in pregnant women.Methods: The prevalence of insomnia (INS) and habitual snoring (HS) were examined in 439 women in the third trimester (34.1 ± 3.7 weeks). Habitual snoring (snoring ≥3 times/week) was self-reported. Insomnia was determined using the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ).Results: Four groups emerged: HS-/ISQ- (n = 161; 36.7%), HS-/ISQ+ (n = 146; 33.3%), HS+/ISQ- (n = 63; 14.4%), and HS+/ISQ+ (n = 69; 15.7%). Logistic regression models revealed both independent associations, as well as comorbid HS/INS status with excessive daytime sleepiness (aOR 3.8, 95%CI 2.3-6.5, p < 0.001; aOR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1-4.4, p = 0.02; aOR 7.2, 95%CI 3.7-14.0, p < 0.001, respectively). Only comorbid HS/INS was associated with gestational hypertension (aOR 3.2 95%CI 1.0-10.6, p = 0.048). Insomnia alone and HS alone were associated with a baby born large for gestational age (aOR 2.9 95%CI 1.2-7.1, p = 0.019 and aOR 3.5, 95%CI 1.1-11.1, p = 0.034 respectively) but however, the comorbid state was not significantly associated with LGA. Only women with HS alone were at increased odds of having an unplanned cesarean section (aOR 2.2 95%CI 1.0-4.6, p = 0.046).Conclusions: Both insomnia alone and comorbid insomnia/habitual snoring were associated with adverse outcomes even after accounting for confounders. These findings are clinically relevant since adverse pregnancy outcomes may have severe consequences for both mother and baby. In order to mitigate these outcomes, identifying viable treatment(s) for women at risk should be considered a high priority.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Connexin hemichannels can open during ischemia, resulting in loss of membrane potential, calcium influx, and release of glutamate. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that opening of hemichannels after cerebral ischemia may contribute to delayed evolution of injury. METHODS: We infused a mimetic peptide that blocks connexin 43 hemichannels into the lateral ventricle of chronically instrumented fetal sheep in utero at 128 ± 1 days gestation (term is 147 days), starting 90 minutes after 30 minutes of severe ischemia induced by reversible bilateral carotid artery occlusion, for either 1 or 25 hours. Sheep were killed 7 days later. RESULTS: Peptide infusion was associated with a graded improvement in recovery of electroencephalographic power after 7 days recovery, from -13 ± 1.9dB (n = 7) after ischemia-vehicle to -9 ± 1.6dB (n = 7) after ischemia-short infusion and -5 ± 1.6dB after ischemia-long infusion (n = 6, p < 0.05). Peptide infusion was associated with reduced seizure activity after ischemia, less frequent status epilepticus (p < 0.05), and earlier return of sleep state cycling (p < 0.05). Ischemia-long infusion (but not ischemia-short infusion) was associated with improved survival of oligodendrocytes in intragyral and periventricular white matter (p < 0.05) and increased brain weight (p < 0.05). Ischemia-long infusion was associated with an intermediate estimate of surviving neurons in the parasagittal cortex of 2.9 ± 0.8 x 10(6) , in comparison to sham control (4.3 ± 0.9 x 10(6) ) or ischemia-vehicle (1.5 ± 0.4 x 10(6) ; p < 0.05 vs sham control). INTERPRETATION: These data support the hypothesis that opening of connexin hemichannels is a significant mediator of postischemic white and gray matter dysfunction and injury.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS)/Willis-Ekbom disease (WED) is common during pregnancy, affecting approximately one in five pregnant women in Western countries. Many report moderate or severe symptoms and negative impact on sleep. There is very little information in the medical literature for practitioners on the management of this condition during pregnancy. Accordingly, a task force was chosen by the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. A committee of nine experts in RLS/WED and/or obstetrics developed a set of 12 consensus questions, conducted a literature search, and extensively discussed potential guidelines. Recommendations were approved by the IRLSSG executive committee, reviewed by IRLSSG membership, and approved by the WED Foundation Medical Advisory Board. These guidelines address diagnosis, differential diagnosis, clinical course, and severity assessment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. Nonpharmacologic approaches, including reassurance, exercise and avoidance of exacerbating factors, are outlined. A rationale for iron supplementation is presented. Medications for RLS/WED are risk/benefit rated for use during pregnancy and lactation. A few are rated "may be considered" when RLS/WED is refractory to more conservative approaches. An algorithm summarizes the recommendations. These guidelines are intended to improve clinical practice and promote further research.

AB  - Objective: Research has demonstrated that exposure to violence and adversity has negative effects on both mental health and biobehavioral outcomes, such as sleep health. Research examining the relationship between past and recent violence exposure and mental health suggests that the effects of childhood adversity are especially pernicious, but to date, no studies have attempted to disentangle the direct, indirect and relative effects of past year versus childhood exposure to violence and adversity on sleep. The objective of the current study was to examine the direct effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and past year intimate partner violence (IPV) on different aspects of sleep health in pregnant women. Method: A sample of high-risk pregnant women (n = 101) were interviewed. Mediation analysis with bias-corrected, bootstrapped confidence intervals was used to evaluate direct and indirect effects. Results: Findings indicated that while ACEs had significant direct effects on mental health, past year IPV had stronger effects on sleep quality, latency, and efficiency. ACEs did, however, indirectly affect subjective sleep quality via past year psychological IPV. Conclusion: These findings suggest that sleep disturbance may be a regulatory stress response that is most clearly linked to past year violence and trauma. That is, though long-term sleep disturbance may be evident following childhood adversity, it is likely that this relationship is better explained by the role of childhood adversity in predicting adulthood revictimization or due to long-term mental health difficulties associated with early trauma.

AB  - Highlights • Key content was identified to share with expectant fathers during maternity care. • Key content relates to infant and partner support. • Additional content relates to planning/participating in birth and father support. • This shared content can benefit all members of the family triad. Abstract Objective To examine whether there is a consensus on what guidance to share with expectant fathers from the prenatal through early infancy period among a multidisciplinary group of professionals with expertise on father involvement. Design Consensus-building approach using mixed methods involving two rounds of data collection. In Round 1, participants were requested to individually generate content as text messages to share with expectant fathers that a father should know or do for his infant, his partner, and himself starting prenatally and through early infancy. A content analysis of Round 1 data was conducted to identify domain content to share with fathers. During Round 2, experts were asked to rate their perceived level of importance of the content generated in Round 1. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies, means, and standard deviations were calculated for Round 2. Setting Electronic survey. Participants Nine multidisciplinary professionals with expertise on father involvement, representing psychology, pediatrics, nursing/midwifery, and sociology. Measurements and findings During Round 1, participants individually generated 302 message content items across domains in the following contexts: plan for/participate in birth (n = 71); his infant (n = 95); his partner (n = 107); and himself (n = 38). During Round 2, participants achieved greatest consensus in more content items in two contexts: infant support and partner support. For infant support, content domains that participants perceived it important to share with for fathers included: knowledge about signs of infant illness, feeding, sleep patterns, and impact of second hand smoke/drug use; training on providing newborn care; and taking action including participating in infant care, providing verbal stimulation, engaging in age-appropriate play and physical contact, supporting safe sleep, and making/attending doctor appointments. For partner support, content domains that participants perceived it important to share with fathers included: communicating with partners with regular check-ins, and about parenting styles and shared responsibilities, signs/symptoms of maternal depression, and hopes/dreams for infant; and taking actions to support partner's physical and emotional health and breastfeeding. Although less content was generated in the other two contexts - plan for/participate in birth and father support - participants achieved consensus on some content in these domains as being important to share with fathers. Key conclusions Despite lack of professional guidelines for expectant fathers, experts generally agreed on the content that should be shared with expectant fathers from pregnancy through early infancy, especially in the domains of infant support and partner support. Implications for practice This study can assist clinicians and practitioners on guidance to share with expectant fathers during their partner's pregnancy and the early postnatal period. Dissemination of such guidance to fathers can assist in benefiting all members of the family.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Factors associated with weight gain during pregnancy that may be linked to maternal overweight and obesity were examined. METHODS: In this observational study, 144 women reported on demographics, (prepregnancy) body weight, and lifestyles in self-reported questionnaires at 30 weeks gestation. Body weight at the end of pregnancy (self-reported at 6 weeks postpartum) was used to determine total gestational weight gain. Multivariate prediction models were developed to identify factors associated with total gestational weight gain and excessive gestational weight gain (i.e., higher weight gain than recommended by the Institute of Medicine). RESULTS: Women gained 14.4 (+/-5.0) kg during pregnancy. Obese women gained almost 4 kg less than normal weight women. Pregnant women judging themselves to be less physically active or women who reported increased food intakes during pregnancy gained significantly more weight. Over one third of women (38%) gained more weight than recommended. Being overweight, judging yourself to be less physically active than others, and a perceived elevated food intake during pregnancy were significantly associated with excessive weight gain (odds ratio [OR] = 6.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01-19.32; OR = 3.96, 95% CI: 1.55l, 10.15; and OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.18, 8.36, respectively). A higher age at menarche and hours of sleep reduced the odds for excessive weight gain (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.99; and OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.93, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Mean hours of sleep, perceived physical activity, and measures of food intake at 30 weeks gestation were identified as modifiable behavioral correlates for excessive gestational weight gain. Strategies to optimize gestational weight gain need to be explored, with a focus on the identified factors.

AB  - Background and Aims: The ideal cardiovascular health (iCVH) construct consists of 4 health behaviors (smoking status, body mass index, physical activity and diet) and 3 health factors (total cholesterol, blood pressure and fasting glucose). A greater number of iCVH components in adolescence are related to better cardiovascular health, but little is known about the correlates of iCVH in adolescents. Thus, the aim of the study was to examine correlates of iCVH in European adolescents.Methods and Results: The study comprised 637 European adolescents with complete iCVH data. Participants were part of the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study, a cross-sectional, multicenter study conducted in 9 different European countries. Correlates investigated were sex and age, family affluence scale, maternal education, geographic location, sleep time, television viewing, duration of pregnancy, birth weight and breastfeeding. Younger adolescents, those whose mothers had medium/high education or those who watched television less than 2 h per day had a greater number of iCVH components compared to those who were older, had a mother with low education or watched television 2 h or more daily (P ≤ 0.01).Conclusion: Since in our study older adolescents had worse iCVH than younger adolescents, early promotion of cardiovascular health may be important. Future studies may also investigate the usefulness of limiting television viewing to promote iCVH. Finally, since adolescents of mothers with low education had poorer iCVH, it may be of special interest to tailor public health promotion to adolescents from families with low socioeconomic status.

AB  - The purposes of this study are to investigate whether the number of nurse home visits during pregnancy and the early postnatal period is related to mother-infant interactions and infant's patterns of self-regulation, whether these interactions change over the course of the first six weeks of life, and if demographic variables are related to mother-infant interactions and sleep patterns. A fourth purpose is to learn about the timing and topics for presentation of educational materials, and about support systems during pregnancy.Twenty-three low-income, first time mothers completed the two week feeding and teaching session, using the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training (NCAST) feeding scale. Nineteen mother-infant dyads completed both the two week and six week feeding observations and the exit interview. Sixteen mothers completed the Sleep Activity Record (SAR).Statistically significant (p < .05) results from the feeding observation are as follows: (a) mothers who had more education had a higher caregiver total score at two weeks and six weeks, (b) infants of mothers with more education had a higher infant total score at two weeks, and (c) the dyad had a higher total contingency (reciprocal interaction) score at two weeks. Mothers in households with higher levels of income had higher contingency scores at 6 weeks, and the change in the contingency score from two to six weeks was positive for mothers with more income. The cluster of positive findings related to the SAR is that infants who had a higher total score at 2 weeks received more feedings at 3-4 weeks.Mothers reported that the medical and health education information of the nurses was valuable during the pregnancy and after the birth of the baby. Mothers appreciated the social support of the nurses and credited them with being an important part of the support network.A larger sample size pooled from multiple sites, a longer time period for intervention and data collection, and serial SAR recordings might yield more significant results. Further investigation into topics covered, the timing of education for pregnant and parenting women, and the role of social supports may provide information to shape policy and funding considerations.

AB  - Background: The socioecological model proposes a wide array of factors that influence behaviours. There is a need to understand salient correlates of these activity behaviours in a specific population. However, few studies identified socio-demographic, behavioural, physical, and psychological correlates of objectively-assessed physical activity and sedentary time in young adults.Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of participants in the Raine Study (a pregnancy cohort started in 1989). Australian young adults (mean 22.1 years ± SD 0.6) wore Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers on the hip 24 h/day for seven days to assess moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time (n = 256 women, n = 219 men). Potential correlates were assessed via clinical assessment and questionnaire and included socio-demographic variables (ethnicity, relationship status, work/study status, education, mothers education), health behaviours (food intake, alcohol consumption, smoking status, sleep quality), and physical and psychological health aspects (anthropometrics, diagnosed disorders, mental health, cognitive performance). Backwards elimination (p < 0.2 for retention) with mixed model regressions were used and the gender-stratified analyses were adjusted for demographic variables, waking wear time and number of valid days.Results: Increased time spent in MVPA was associated with: being single (IRR 1.44 vs in a relationship living together, 95%CI: 1.17, 1.77, p = .001) in women; and better sleep quality in men (lower scores better IRR 0.97, 95%CI: 0.93, 1.00). Less time spent sedentary was associated with: lower mother's education (- 32.1 min/day, 95%CI -52.9, 11.3, p = 0.002 for having mother with no university degree vs at least a baccalaureate degree) and smoking (- 44.3 min/day, 95%CI: - 72.8, - 15.9, p = .0002) for women; lower education status (- 32.1 min/day, 95%CI: -59.5, - 4.8, p = 0.021 for having no university degree vs at least a baccalaureate degree) and lower depression scores in men (- 2.0, 95%CI: - 3.5, - 0.4, p = 0.014); more alcoholic drinks per week for women (- 1.9 min/day, 95%CI: -3.1, - 0.6, p = 0.003) and men (- 1.0, 95%CI: -1.8, - 0.3, p = 0.007).Conclusions: Less desirable correlates were associated with positive levels of activity in young Australian adult women and men. Interventions to increase MVPA and decrease sedentary activity in young adults need to specifically consider the life stage of young adults.

AB  - Background: Depression during pregnancy is associated with higher maternal morbidity and mortality, and subsequent possible adverse effects on the cognitive, emotional and behavioral development of the child. The aim of the study was to identify maternal characteristics associated with poor mental health, in a group of overweight/obese pregnant women in nine European countries, and thus, to contribute to better recognition and intervention for maternal depression.Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, baseline data from early pregnancy (< 20 weeks) of the DALI (Vitamin D and Lifestyle Intervention for gestational diabetes mellitus prevention) study were analyzed. Maternal mental health was assessed with the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Women were classified as having a low (WHO-5 ≤ 50) or high wellbeing.Results: A total of 735 pregnant women were included. The prevalence of having a low wellbeing was 27.2%, 95% CI [24.0, 30.4]. Multivariate analysis showed independent associations between low wellbeing and European ethnicity, OR = .44, 95% CI [.25, .77], shift work, OR = 1.81, 95% CI [1.11, 2.93], insufficient sleep, OR = 3.30, 95% CI [1.96, 5.55], self-efficacy, OR = .95, 95% CI [.92, .98], social support, OR = .94, 95% CI [.90, .99], and pregnancy-related worries (socioeconomic: OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.02, 1.15]; health: OR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.01, 1.11]; relationship: OR = 1.17, 95% CI [1.05, 1.31]).Conclusions: Mental health problems are common in European overweight/obese pregnant women. The identified correlates might help in early recognition and subsequent treatment of poor mental health problems during pregnancy. This is important to reduce the unfavorable effects of poor mental health on pregnancy outcomes.Trial Registration: ISRCTN70595832 , 02.12.2011.

AB  - A genetic test for trisomy 21-an extra third chromosome 21-can let parents know if their child would be born with Down syndrome. One in 800 to 1,000 babies have Down syndrome, marked by learning disabilities, physical similarities of the face (short neck, wide nose, epicanthic fold to the eyes), and a series of related birth defects such as sleep apnea and congenital heart defects. Yet few human beings seem able to love and be loved more than someone with Down syndrome. These links help parents of children with Down syndrome, and pregnant women, learn more about it.

AB  - Background Sleep disturbances are common in women, especially during pregnancy. Previous studies have confirmed the importance of sleep disturbances as a risk factor of adverse pregnancy outcomes and the need for screening and treatment of inadequate sleep. These reports, however, did not examine health-related quality of life which may be affected by sleep long before adverse clinical consequences are detectable in women during pregnancy. Objectives To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between sleep and health-related quality of life in pregnant women. Design A prospective observational study. Setting A university-affiliated hospital in Taiwan and participants’ homes. Participants A total of 164 pregnant women completed questionnaires and wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 days each trimester. Methods Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy, subjective sleep was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and health-related quality of life was measured using the SF-12v2 questionnaire across three trimesters. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between sleep and health-related quality of life. Results Sixty-four (39.0%) women consistently had an average sleep efficiency < 85% by actigraphy and 40 (24.4%) had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score > 5 in all three trimesters. Cross-sectionally, more actigraphic daytime sleep ( p = 0.04) and better subjective sleep quality ( p < 0.01) were associated with better physical health-related quality of life in first-trimester pregnant women. Better actigraphic sleep efficiency ( p = 0.04) and better subjective sleep quality ( p < 0.01) were associated with better mental health-related quality of life in second-trimester pregnant women. Longer actigraphic total nighttime sleep ( p < 0.01) and better subjective sleep quality ( p < 0.01) were associated with better mental health-related quality of life in third-trimester pregnant women. Longitudinally, first-trimester actigraphic total nighttime sleep ( p < 0.05) and subjective sleep quality ( p < 0.01) predicted mental health-related quality of life in the second and third trimester. Conclusions Sleep disturbances are a highly prevalent and persistent problem in pregnant women. Adequate sleep is essential for women at all pregnancy stages and improving nocturnal sleep quantity and quality in early gestation is of utmost importance for an optimal health-related quality of life later in pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the association among nighttime sleep and daytime napping behaviors, depressive symptoms, and perception of fatigue in pregnant women. DESIGN: A prospective descriptive study with within-subject design. SETTING: A university-affiliated hospital and participants' home environments. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight third trimester nulliparous women completed sleep and depressive symptom questionnaires, wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 consecutive days, and kept a concurrent diary reporting naps and rating their level of fatigue using a 0-10 visual analogue scale each morning, midday, afternoon, and evening. A generalized estimating equation regression model was applied to evaluate the time-dependent association. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Mean duration of total nighttime sleep by actigraphy was 386.3 ± 60.7 min, with 11 (28.9%) women having an average total nighttime sleep < 6 h. Nineteen women (50%) napped > 3 days, and only 2 women did not nap over the entire week. Antecedent night sleep duration had a significant inverse association with morning (P = 0.022) and afternoon fatigue (P = 0.009) of the subsequent day. Self-reported naps were significantly associated with midday fatigue (P = 0.003). More depressive symptoms predicted more severe fatigue throughout the day. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that interventions designed to increase sleep duration and decrease depressive symptoms have the potential to prevent, ameliorate, or reduce fatigue in pregnant women. Depressive symptoms during pregnancy likely share some psychological and behavioral tendencies with fatigue and/or sleep disturbance which may complicate the evaluation of intervention effect.

AB  - Data from our research are reviewed showing limited attentiveness and responsivity to animate stimuli in newborns of depressed mothers. These include face-voice stimuli of mothers and strangers, newborn cry sounds and instrumental and vocal music. Newborns of depressed mothers are also noted to be less attentive and responsive when presented with inanimate stimuli, including different texture nipples, different temperature nipples and different weight tubes. Potential underlying mechanisms are suggested by research showing negative effects of prenatal depression, elevated prenatal cortisol and lower prenatal dopamine and serotonin on the newborns of depressed mothers. Additional risk factors are explored, including sleep disturbances and other prenatal stressors. Early interventions, including pregnancy massage, massage therapy for infants and demonstration of the Brazelton Assessment, have been noted to enhance the neonates' attentiveness and responsivity to animate and inanimate stimuli. Limitations of these studies are discussed, including the sample being limited to lower SES women who have many other problems that potentially affect newborns. More controlled studies are needed to assess potential mediating factors for the inferior performance of these newborns on perceptual tasks such as limited attentiveness and/or greater arousal as well as longitudinal follow-up studies to determine whether these limited perceptual abilities continue into infancy.
