TI  - Circadian rhythms of blood pressure and pressor hormones in normal and
      hypertensive pregnancy.
PG  - 321-6
AB  - 1. Circadian patterns of blood pressure and pressor hormones were studied in late
      pregnancy in ten normotensive women and twenty-one hypertensives. 2. Plasma renin
      activity, angiotensin II and free adrenaline and noradrenaline leves were highest
      at 0900 h in normotensives and uncomplicated hypertensives. Catecholamine
      sulphate levels were lowest at 0900 h. 3. In eight pre-eclamptic hypertensives,
      plasma renin activity, and angiotensin II were suppressed. 4. Adrenaline sulphate
      levels were raised in hypertensives. 5. Four pre-eclamptics with noctural
      hypertension had the highest blood pressures; their diurnal rhythm for
      noradrenaline sulphate was reversed but they showed no consistent pattern of
      pressor hormones. However failure of angiotensin II, adrenaline or noradrenaline 
      to fall at night in subjects with increased vascular reactivity could contribute 
      to their nocturnal hypertension.

TI  - Influence of sleep state on the response to hypercapnia in fetal lambs.
PG  - 125-42
AB  - The effect of sleep state on the respiratory response to hypercapnia was studied 
      in 14 chronic fetal sheep, 125-140 days gestation. Fetal PaCO2 was raised by 11
      to 34 Torr by gradually increasing the maternal FICO2 to 0.09. Fetal sleep state 
      was monitored. Fetal breathing (FB) was analysed in terms of frequency (f),
      tracheal pressure (TP) and ventilation equivalent (VEq) = sigma TP /min. In 16
      out of 17 experiments on apneic fetuses in NREM sleep, the fetuses switched to
      REM sleep and in 14 instances began to breathe within 2 1/2 min thereafter. The
      PaCO2 at which apneic fetuses started breathing was 54.8 +/- 8.4 Torr (mean +/-
      SD). In 4 out of 10 trials on breathing fetuses in REM sleep the fetuses switched
      to NREM sleep and stopped breathing before removal of the CO2 stimulus. During
      REM sleep hypercapnia stimulated FB by an increase in TP and by a reduction in
      the number and duration of apneic pauses. It is concluded that in the fetal lamb 
      CO2 stimulates breathing only during REM sleep and that this stimulus is
      superimposed on the basic mechanism that stimulated spontaneous FB during this
      sleep state.

TI  - [Congenital Minamata disease accompanied by arachnoid cyst (author's transl)].
PG  - 259-66
AB  - A male, born on December 8, 1956, during the period when many Minamata diseases
      broke out in a district. His parents who ate much fish and shell fish taken in
      Minamata Bay suffered from the light, incomplete Minamata disease showing sensory
      disturbance, the constriction of the visual field, muscular weakness, etc. He
      weighed 3,225 gr. upon the normal birth given 10 months after pregnancy. His
      abnormalities were noted since his head was not stabilized on the neck even six
      months after the birth. Because of the delay in the development of the motor
      function, he became barely able to sit, stand up and begin walking at the ages of
      3, 5 and 6 respectively. In 1962 (at the age of 6), his congenital Minamata
      disease was diagnosed in view of his clinical symptoms and epidemiological
      conditions. The mercury value in the hair and blood upon the birth is not known
      because a considerable time had elapsed after the birth when his mercury
      poisoning was discovered. However, the clinical symptoms included intelligence
      disturbance, character change, dysarthria, primitive reflexes, strabismus,
      hypersalivation, ataxia and hyperkinesia, indicating a typical congenital
      Minamata disease. Until he became 13 years old (1969) or so, his mental and motor
      function developed, both gradually. In the same year, he was admitted to a
      special class for the handicapped. EEG examination revealed that there was a slow
      alpha activity in the basic pattern and that 6 Hz positive spike was found in the
      sleep EEG. The constriction of the visual field was classified through
      examination.2+

PG  - 27-30
AB  - The authors examined the effect of prednisolone-salium succinate administered on 
      the 17th or 18th day of pregnancy on the adrenal function of newborn rats. They
      found that in doses of 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg it does not affect physiological
      development or, respectively, the extent of the circadian rhythm or the stress
      response. However, the adrenal function of newborn animals was significantly
      inhibited by 30.0 mg/kg as regards its adaptability to extra-uterine life. The
      authors point out the importance of investigations to determine the adrenal
      function of newborns following steroid therapy to prevent RDS.

TI  - Effects of maternal ethanol consumption in rats on basal and rhythmic
      pituitary-adrenal function in neonatal offspring.
PG  - 49-58
AB  - Neonatal corticoid treatment delays development of the circadian rhythm of plasma
      corticosterone in rats. We therefore sought to determine whether fetal or
      neonatal exposure to ethanol, a substance which activates the
      hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, produces similar effects. Subjects were the
      offspring of dams fed a 5.0% w/v ethanol-containing liquid diet or pair-fed an
      isocaloric control diet during gestation weeks two and three or during postnatal 
      week one. At birth (day 1), the fetal ethanol-exposed pups had significantly
      higher brain and plasma corticosterone levels than the pair-fed or normal
      controls; brain and body weights were unaffected. By day 3, brain and plasma
      corticosterone titers in the fetal ethanol-exposed pups declined to the levels of
      the pair-fed and normal controls, although brain weights were significantly
      reduced. Significantly higher p.m. than a.m. levels of plasma corticosterone
      first occurred on day 18 both in the fetal ethanol-exposed pups and in the
      pair-fed and normal controls. Thus, despite its causing elevated corticosterone
      levels at birth, fetal exposure to ethanol did not affect the onset of the
      pituitary-adrenal circadian rhythm. On the other hand, exposure to ethanol during
      the first neonatal week delayed the onset of the pituitary-adrenal rhythm from
      day 18 to day 21. However, even greater delays occurred in the neonatal pair-fed 
      controls, suggesting that the delays following neonatal exposure were due to
      nutritional deficits rather than to alcohol per se. The developmental and
      long-term influences of elevated corticoid levels at birth in fetal
      ethanol-exposed rats on other aspects of pituitary-adrenal function remain to be 
      determined.

TI  - Physiological and pathological variations in saliva cortisol.
PG  - 357-64
AB  - A radioimmunological method for measuring saliva cortisol was worked out. It
      includes one extraction and one radiocompetitive reaction with an anticortisol
      3-CMO:BSA immunoserum. Frequent values for saliva cortisol were determined in
      various physiological and pathological conditions and compared to plasma cortisol
      values. In adult men, the mean concentrations at 8 a.m. and midnight were
      respectively 14.50 +/- 7.10 and 1.40 +/- 1.21 nmol/l (mean +/- SD). In untreated 
      women, plasma and saliva cortisol levels were not significantly different from
      those measured in women taking estroprogestative drugs or in pregnant women.
      Following stimulation by synthetic beta 1-24 ACTH (Synacthen), the saliva
      cortisol determined 90 min after the 8 a.m. sampling rose by over 500% whereas
      plasma cortisol only rose by 120%. Similarly the drop in 8 a.m. cortisol, which
      followed midnight administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone was larger for saliva
      than for plasma cortisol. In patients with adrenal hyperactivity the circadian
      rhythm disappeared from saliva cortisol and patients with deficient adrenal
      activity displayed drastically reduced levels for saliva cortisol. Saliva
      cortisol seems thus to be more helpful to diagnosis than plasma cortisol.

PG  - 427-32
AB  - A non-stress test was applied to 186 women with high-risk pregnancy, and an
      oxytocin provocation test was added immediately. Increased frequency or
      acceleration of foetal heart rate accompanied by foetal movement was defined as
      "reactive" and interpreted as good condition of the foetus. Absence of
      accelerations adequate in number and magnitude within 30 minutes from testing was
      considered as alarming. Such tests were defined "non-reactive". Such situations
      could be attributed to temporary hypoxia or sleep of the foetus. Both the number 
      of positive oxytocin provocation tests and perinatal morbidity were higher with
      significance (p less than 0.001) in the "non-reactive" group. One perinatal death
      occurred in that group. The non-stress test proved to be a non-invasive, harmless
      method and highly reliable for screening of women for high-risk pregnancy. It
      enabled better economy of cost and time and in the use of equipment.

TI  - Diurnal and short-term variation of blood pressure: comparison of preeclamptic,
      chronic hypertensive, and normotensive patients.
PG  - 291-6
AB  - It has been suggested that the decrease in blood pressure during sleep is greater
      in patients with chronic hypertension than in preeclamptic patients. The DINAMAP 
      (device for indirect noninvasive automatic mean arterial pressure) monitor was
      used to determine the mean arterial, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure, at
      15-minute intervals, and 24 hours. Three groups of 15 patients each were studied:
      mildly preeclamptic, chronically hypertensive, and normotensive patients in the
      third trimester. In addition, 2 patients with severe preeclampsia were studied.
      The automatic readings were compared with auscultated blood pressures. There was 
      short-term variation in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 20 to 40 and
      15 to 30 mmHg, respectively, with consecutive 15-minute recordings. A decrease in
      blood pressure during sleep was seen in all groups, except in the 2 patients with
      severe preeclampsia. This fall varied between 5 and 20 mmHg systolic and 5 and 18
      mmHg diastolic. The auscultated blood pressure differed from the automatic blood 
      pressure by 5 to 40 mmHg systolic and 5 to 35 mmHg diastolic. In the clinical
      management of patients, these findings are significant, as they demonstrate
      short-term variation in blood pressure and differences in the auscultated versus 
      automatic blood pressure readings. Also, changes in blood pressure occur during
      sleep; this may be important with regard to the timing and dose of medication
      given to pregnant patients with chronic hypertension or preeclampsia.

TI  - The effect of brief episodes of diminished uterine blood flow on breathing
      movements, sleep states and heart rate in fetal sheep.
PG  - 231-43
AB  - Responses to brief episodes of occlusion of the middle uterine artery were
      examined in six fetal sheep in utero between 122 and 140 days of gestation.
      Continuous recordings were made of fetal breathing movements, electro-cortical
      (ECoG) and electro-ocular (EOG) activity, arterial pressure and heart rate. Five 
      minutes of unilateral or bilateral arterial occlusion caused fetal hypoxaemia
      while changes in mean arterial PCO2 and pH were not statistically significant.
      Occlusions usually led to a cessation of rapid eye movements (REM) and
      respiratory activity (86% of trials), to the appearance of high-voltage slow
      waves in the ECoG (84% of trials) and to a fall in heat rate of more than 10%
      (81% of trials). With the exception of the changes in heart rate, these responses
      resemble those which frequently occur during non-labour contractions of the
      uterus. We conclude that the cessation of fetal breathing movements and rapid eye
      movements and the onset of slow waves in the ECoG seen in association with
      uterine contractions may be due to the mild hypoxaemia which accompanies them.

TI  - Identifying and treating pregnant patients at risk from alcohol.
PG  - 149-54
AB  - Heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been associated with retardation
      of fetal growth and abnormal fetal development. Pregnant women whose offspring
      are at risk because of alcohol abuse can be identified and counselled by health
      professional providing prenatal care. Offspring born to women who had been
      drinking heavily and subsequently abstained from or reduced their intake of
      alcohol before the third trimester demonstrated improvements in growth and in
      regulation of sleep-awake states. The existing health care delivery system can be
      modified in a cost-effective manner to treat pregnant women who are problem
      drinkers. Physicians' attitudes and behaviour are critical for the success of
      this strategy.

PG  - 169-74
AB  - Dams from two inbred strains of mice (C57BR and BALB/c) were treated with
      caffeine in solution in their drinking water during gestation. Doses of caffeine 
      used corresponded to about 60, 80 or 100 mg/kg/day; controls received tap water. 
      The offspring (as adults) revealed a significantly increased sleep time following
      caffeine treatment, but primarily as slow wave sleep in the males of the BALB/c
      strain and paradoxical sleep in the females of the C57BR strain. BALB/c females
      and C57BR males were relatively unaffected. These results, and in particular the 
      sex differences, are discussed in terms of a possible central site of action of
      caffeine.

TI  - Migraine in childhood and its prognosis.
PG  - 71-5
AB  - In 1955 a population study in Uppsala comprising about 9,000 school children
      showed that migraine increased from 1.4% at the age of seven to 5.3% at fifteen. 
      With increasing age there was an increasing predominance of girls. A matched
      comparison between 73 children with more pronounced migraine and 73 control
      children showed a greater tendency in the migraine group to abdominal pain,
      motion sickness, sleep disturbance and orthostatic symptoms. In a longitudinal
      study lasting 23 years the 73 migraine children were followed-up until all were
      over 30 years of age. During puberty and as young adults 62% were free from
      migraine for at least two years. Of these, 22% again suffered migraine regularly.
      Thus, 60% had migraine attacks at 30. Girls seem to have a greater relapse rate
      than boys. Most of the girls with classical migraine were headache free during
      pregnancy. Every third family with one parent belonging to the migraine group and
      with children over four years of age had one child with migraine symptoms.
      Migraine seems to be more frequently inherited via the mother, and to girls.

TI  - [Human fetal breathing movements: basic analysis and clinical relationship to
      fetal well-being (author's transl)].
PG  - 597-606
AB  - By means of real time B-scan, human fetal breathing movements (FBM) was basically
      and clinically investigated on 244 observations in 215 pregnancies. The results
      obtained were as follows. (1) FBM was frequently observed during active sleep in 
      which FHR variability and fetal movement increased. (2) The incidence of FBM
      increased rapidly from 12.5% at 23-27 weeks to 77-100% at more than 35 weeks
      gestation, but reduced to 44% at delivery. (3) FBM became more regular and deeper
      with advancing weeks of pregnancy, especially after 36 weeks of gestation. The
      frequency of FBM in normal pregnancy was slightly high at 28-29 weeks, but almost
      the same rates at 30-41 weeks. (4) Maternal mean blood glucose level of 6 cases
      (72.3 +/- 5.8 mg/dl) in which FBM absent in repeated observations was
      significantly lower than those of 10 cases (94.7 +/- 14 mg/dl) in which the
      percentage time spent breathing were 50% or more. (5) Clinically, a relationship 
      between the presence or absence of FBM and Apgar score was not recognized.
      However, when the percentage time spent breathing was less than 30% or FBM was
      continuous and considerably deep, the incidence of neonatal asphyxia or FHR
      abnormality during labor was significantly increased.

TI  - Development of patterns of respiratory activity in unanesthetized fetal sheep in 
      utero.
PG  - 693-700
AB  - Respiratory activity (diaphragmatic electromyogram) was recorded in six
      unanesthetized in utero fetal lambs, between 0.7 of gestation and term.
      Respiratory patterns generated by the fetus showed developmental changes that
      included 1) an emergence of a periodic modulation of respiratory rate producing
      alternating active and quite phases (mean cycle length of 37 min between 130 and 
      140 days' gestation; 2) an increase in percentage apnea (expiratory time greater 
      than 10 s) from 20% at 110 days to 60% at 140 days; and 3) a linear decrease in
      the 2-h average respiratory rate, while mean rate during active phases showed no 
      consistent gestational decline. Electrocortical and electroocular activity was
      monitored in three of six fetuses; however, discrete sleep state patterns could
      not be consistently identified. The results demonstrate a gestational change in
      the respiratory patterns of the developing fetus and suggest an orderly
      maturation of the mechanisms controlling respiratory neuronal output.

TI  - Hypercapnic stimulation of respiratory activity in unanesthetized fetal sheep in

PG  - 701-8
AB  - Respiratory responses to hypercapnia were studied in seven chronic in utero fetal
      lambs between 105 and 138 days' gestation (16 expts). Fetal arterial CO2 tension 
      was raised (mean increase 9.9 Torr) by altering maternal inspired gas
      concentrations. Diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) was recorded as the index of
      respiratory activity. Electrocortical and electroocular activity (3 fetuses) were
      monitored in an attempt to define sleep state. Average respiratory rate increased
      (90%) and fetal apnea decreased (60%) during hypercapnia. Mean respiratory rate
      during "on" periods (greater than 6 EMG bursts/min) increased significantly
      during hypercapnia throughout the gestational epoch studied. Mean duration of the
      inspiratory time (TI) showed no significant change. Variability in both rate and 
      TI decreased in response to CO2 at all gestations. Integrated EMG activity per
      burst divided by TI increased significantly at all gestations; however, no
      gestational increase in responsiveness to CO2 was seen. Sleep states were not
      able to be consistently identified, and a quantifiable electrocortical response
      to CO2 was not observed. These results indicate a relatively early functional
      maturation of fetal respiratory responses to CO2.

TI  - Fetal heart rates during maternal wakefulness and sleep.
PG  - 301-9
AB  - This study was designed to provide normative data on fetal heart rate (FHR), FHR 
      variability, accelerations, and decelerations during maternal sleep in the third 
      trimester of pregnancy and to identify rhythmicity in FHR variability.
      Twenty-four polygraphic recordings were obtained in 16 pregnant women at 32 and
      36 weeks' gestation. FHR parameters were not predictably influenced by maternal
      sleep states. Cyclic changes in FHR variability with median cycle length of 53
      minutes were observed. Accelerations and decelerations occurred an average of
      12.2 and 4 times per 100 minutes, respectively. Bradycardia and tachycardia
      persisting beyond 10 minutes were not seen. FHR variability ranged from marked to
      decreased within recordings of the same subject; this observation has
      implications for non-stress testing of the fetus.

TI  - Effects of synthetic glucocorticoid administration on human fetal breathing
      movements at 34 to 35 weeks' gestational age.
PG  - 324-8
AB  - Fetal breathing movements were measured in six women who had received exogenous
      glucocorticoids throughout pregnancy and in whom the endogenous circadian rhythm 
      in cortisol was absent or had been suppressed. Studies were performed for 24-hour
      observation periods while women received prednisone and then one week later on
      the same women after equivalent doses of dexamethasone. Fetal breathing movements
      occurred 29.9% +/- 1.9% of the time in the prednisone-treated group and this was 
      not changed in the same fetuses after dexamethasone treatment. There was a
      significant increase in the percentage of time spent making breathing movements
      during the second and third hours following breakfast, lunch, and dinner (P less 
      than 0.001). A fourth peak in fetal breathing activity occurred in the late
      evening and seemed to be related to the time of the evening glucocorticoid
      medication. These data were compatible with the hypothesis that maternal
      glucocorticoid concentrations may influence patterns of fetal breathing movements
      at 34 to 35 weeks' gestational age.

TI  - Effect of serum lipids on radioimmunoassays of unconjugated estriol in serum.
PG  - 280-5
AB  - Controversy regarding the presence of a circadian rhythm in unconjugated estriol 
      in serum during pregnancy led us to study the possibility that the observed
      rhythms actually are the result of partitioning of estriol into serum lipids when
      these increase postprandially. Addition of triglycerides to purified estriol
      standards significantly decreased (p less than 0.001) apparent estriol as
      detected by radioimmunoassay after separation on dextran-coated charcoal and
      significantly increased (p less than 0.001) estriol as detected by
      radioimmunoassay after double-antibody separation. Compensation for individual
      nonspecific binding of standards nullified the effect of lipids only in systems
      involving dextran-coated charcoal separation, incubated for 1.0 h at 37 degrees C
      followed by 1.0 h at 4 degrees C. In contrast to other protocols, data obtained
      with this system revealed no significant circadian variation in serum estriol
      concentrations in normal pregnant women (CV, 4.3%). Evidently, reported
      variations in apparent serum estriol concentration are artifactual.

TI  - Loss of diurnal rhythm in plasma estrone, estradiol, and estriol in women treated
      with synthetic glucocorticoids at 34 to 35 weeks' gestation.
PG  - 338-43
AB  - In order to examine the effect of endogenous rhythms in fetal and/or maternal
      adrenal activity on diurnal changes in plasma estrone (E1), estradiol (E2),
      estriol (E3), and progesterone (P) in women at 34 to 35 weeks' gestation, we
      measured these steroids in a group of six women in whom the endogenous circadian 
      rhythm in cortisol was absent or had been suppressed by treatment with exogenous 
      synthetic glucocorticoids. All steroids were suppressed, and no diurnal rhythms
      in E1, E2, E3 or P were found. Suppression of cortisol and estrogens was greater 
      after dexamethasone (Dx) than after a glucocorticoid-equivalent dosage of
      prednisone (Pd). Loss of the maternal estrogen rhythms seen in normal patients is
      consistent with the suggestion that such rhythms may be attributable to diurnal
      changes in maternal and/or fetal adrenal output of potential precursors. The
      differences in cortisol and estrogen concentrations after Dx and Pd may indicate 
      dissociation of the glucocorticoid (hyperglycemic) and adrenocorticotropic
      hormone-suppressing activities of these compounds.

TI  - Sickle-cell disease in a British urban community.
PG  - 283-6
AB  - Seventy cases of sickle-cell disease were identified in the London Borough of
      Brent from records dating back to 1962. All but three were still alive and, with 
      one exception, were recalled for confirmation of the diagnosis and to provide
      personal and family histories. The group consisted of 22 individuals with
      homozygous sickle-cell anaemia (Hb SS), 12 with sickle-cell/beta-thalassaemia
      double heterozygosity, 34 with sickle-cell/haemoglobin C disease (Hb SC), and two
      with the combination of haemoglobin S and hereditary persistence of fetal
      haemoglobin. They were predominantly of West Indian origin, more than half had
      been born in Britain, and most were aged under 25. The records for 304 patient
      admissions between 1962 and 1979 were analysed. There were 199
      sickle-cell-disease-related admissions, 61 unrelated to sickle-cell disease, and 
      44 for pregnancy or its complications. Admissions per patient-year averaged less 
      than one, except for children with Hb SS under the age of 5 years, who were
      admitted more frequently. The commonest reasons for admission were painful crises
      (74% of all admissions) and the "chest syndrome" (21%). There were four
      pneumococcal infections, all in children with Hb SS under the age of 8 years; all
      recovered. Three patients, aged 10, 15, and 50 years, died. The two children with
      Hb SS died in their sleep without gross evidence of sickling at necropsy.
      Multiple brain infarcts were found at necropsy in the 50-year-old woman with Hb
      SC who, having survived nine uneventful pregnancies, succumbed to an infection
      after cryosurgery to the cervix. Obstetric records were available for 18 term
      pregnancies in 11 women. Three antenatal sickling crises and three postpartum
      thromboembolic complications were encountered. There were no maternal or
      perinatal deaths. Fifteen asymptomatic individuals with sickle-cell disease were 
      diagnosed as a result of routine screening procedures. There are likely to be
      many such individuals currently undiagnosed in the community. They urgently need 
      identification because of their increased risks from pregnancy, surgery, and
      infection.

TI  - Variations in some of the body fluid hormone levels currently used for endocrine 
      monitoring during the third trimester of pregnancy.
PG  - 40-7
AB  - We have investigated the variability of four hormonal parameters used for the
      endocrine monitoring of the third trimester of pregnancy (E3, E4, HPL, SP1). We
      have observed no circadian rhythm of Estriol, Estetrol, HPL, and SP1. The
      within-a-day and the day-to-day variations are much greater for E4 than for E3
      and for HPL than for SP1. The standard deviations were great for the steroids,
      especially for E4 and much less for the protein hormones, especially SP1. This
      implies that it is necessary to have serial assays of the steroids to have any
      confidence in the levels, while good monitoring could be guaranteed with a
      smaller number of assays for HPL, and SP1.

      effects on development.
PG  - 66-88
AB  - A variety of radioimmunoassays specifically characterized for use with fetal and 
      maternal ovine plasma have been used to measure steroid hormone concentrations in
      small plasma samples drawn simultaneously from mother and fetus. By repeated
      sampling from the same animal preparation the changes over time of plasma
      concentrations of cortisol, pregnenolone and its sulphate, and oestrone and
      oestrone sulphate have been systematically studied. In animals delivering
      spontaneously at term the fetal plasma cortisol concentration rises between 120
      and 130 days gestation and plays an important part in the maturation of several
      vital physiological systems, including the fetal thyroid axis. In normal term
      deliveries and premature deliveries induced by synthetic adrenocorticotropin
      (ACTH(1-24), 1 microgram h-1), the concentration of oestrone sulphate in maternal
      plasma increases before the fetal plasma concentration. Fetal and maternal
      oestrogens are probably important in the control of the low-grade tonic
      myometrial activity that occurs throughout gestation, in the initiation of labour
      and in the control of uterine blood flow. Low-grade tonic myometrial activity
      affects fetal oxygenation, fetal breathing and the fetal sleep state and may
      constitute a pathway through which the mother influences fetal development, with 
      important physiological and possibly pathological consequences.

TI  - The central control of fetal breathing and movements.
PG  - 295-307
AB  - In fetal lambs after 115 days gestation breathing movements become episodic in
      association with electrocortical differentiation into predominantly high voltage 
      slow or low voltage rapid activity, the latter characteristic of rapid eye
      movement sleep. Section of the brainstem at or above the colliculi dissociates
      fetal breathing from electrocortical activity. It is included that breathing is
      inhibited, towards the end of gestation, by a supracollicular mechanism during
      high voltage activity. After brainstem transection at the colliculi hypoxia no
      longer causes an arrest of fetal breathing, which often becomes more vigorous.
      The arrest of breathing in normal fetuses subjected to mild hypoxia is also
      attributed to a supracollicular mechanism. The pattern of fetal skeletal
      movements and of the spinal segmental reflexes is related to electrocortical
      activity near term; both are suppressed by hypoxia. The hypothesis is discussed
      of a central control centre, excited directly or indirectly by hypoxia, which
      inhibits fetal movements including breathing. Its possible location is
      considered.

AB  - The concentration of blood and plasma glucose in developing, pregnant and
      post-partum rats has been determined under uniform conditions of housing, feeding
      and circadian rhythms. The glucose content of erythrocytes and of the plasma
      compartment has been estimated using the packed cell hematocrit value as
      correction factor. During pregnancy and fetal development there were significant 
      reductions in the proportion of intracellular glucose, and significant increases 
      during the suckling and weaning period. There was no direct relationship with
      plasma insulin levels. Results are discussed in relation to aspects of metabolism
      specific to the physiological components of the breeding cycle studied; plasma
      glucose homeostasis is held very constant; both intraerythrocytic and plasma
      concentrations should be considered when studying glucose homeostasis in given
      physiological situations.

TI  - THe relationship between myometrial activity and sleep state and breathing in
      fetal sheep throughout the last third of gestation.
PG  - 653-9
AB  - Between 106 and 144 days' gestation, periods of uterine electromyographic (EMG)
      activity and associated increases in uterine tone (contractures) were accompanied
      by a change in fetal ocular activity in 294 (63%) of 467 cases. In 260 (88.4%) of
      the changes, there was a switch fromm the active to nonactive state. The
      incidence of this change was significantly greater (p < 0.01) than the switch
      from the nonactive to the active state. The fetal electrocorticogram changed
      state in 34 (74%) of 46 contractures, the change being from low-amplitude to
      high-amplitude activity in 28 (82%) of the cases. This difference was significant
      (p < 0.01). Fetal breathing movements (FBM), as indicated by activity of the
      posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, changed in 134 (55%) of 243 contractures, the
      change being from active to the quiescent state in 115 (85%) of contractures.
      Diaphragmatic activity changed in 11 (61%) of 183 contractures, with a change
      from activity to quiescence occurring in 100 instances (90%). Changes in tracheal
      pressure were associated with an altered state of FBM in 190 (61%) of 314
      contractures, and the change was from the presence of FBM to absence of them in
      178 (94%) of the changes. In all three of these indicators of FBM, the change
      from breathing activity to quiescence was statistically significant (p < 0.01).

PG  - 149-57
AB  - 1. Electrocorticogram (ECoG), electromyogram (EMG) of the lateral rectus and
      antigravity muscles (neck and masseter) and breathing activity (FB) were
      monitored in chronically prepared fetal sheep of 125-140 days gestation and in
      newborn lambs up to 11 days postnatal age. 2. Awake state (AW), non-rapid eye
      movement sleep (NREM) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) were defined using
      standard criteria for ECoG, eye movements and postural muscle tone. 3. The
      percentage of time the fetuses spent in each state was: NREM sleep 53%, REM sleep
      41.4%, and AW 5.6%. 4. Spontaneous intrauterine breathing activity occurred only 
      during REM sleep, but 35% of REM sleep was not associated with FB. 5. Gasps
      (isolated deep inspirations) appeared occasionally throughout the recording and
      were not related to any specific sleep state or wakefulness. 6. In the fetus, the
      monosynaptic reflex (MSR) induced by direct electrical stimulation of the fibular
      nerve was enhanced by about 75% during REM sleep compared to NREM and AW. In the 
      newborn lamb the adult pattern of suppression of MSR during REM sleep was not
      seen until several days after birth.

      and 38 to 39 weeks gestational age.
PG  - 983-8
AB  - Diurnal changes in the concentrations of oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2) in
      maternal peripheral plasma have been measured in samples of blood taken at one
      hour intervals from women at 30 to 31, 34 to 35 and 38 to 39 weeks of pregnancy. 
      There was a significant effect of time of sampling on the plasma concentration of
      E1 at all stages of gestation, and circadian changes in the levels of E1 were
      apparent at 34 to 35 and 38 to 39 weeks. Peak values were measured around 0830 to
      0930 hours, and troughs occurred between 0130 and 0530 hours. Significant effects
      of time of sampling on the plasma concentration of E2 were found at 34 to 35 and 
      38 to 39 weeks of pregnancy; night-time concentrations were lower than the peak
      values at 0730 to 0830 hours. The relation of these changes to the circadian
      rhythms in the concentrations of cortisol and oestriol in maternal plasma are
      discussed.

TI  - Investigations of ultradian and circadian rhythms in the concentration of
      cortisol and prolactin in the plasma of dairy cattle.
PG  - 557-61
AB  - This experiment analysed the circadian and ultradian pattern of secretion of
      cortisol and prolactin in cattle, and from this a meaningful sampling technique
      for these hormones has been suggested. Two Friesian and two Jersey heifers,
      non-pregnant and 18 months of age, were bled (2 ml blood) every 10 min for 24 h
      via an indwelling jugular cannula inserted 6 h before sampling commenced. The
      concentration of cortisol in plasma showed an ultradian rhythm with an amplitude 
      of approximately 30 ng/ml and a frequency of about 0.6 cycles/h. Elimination of
      the ultradian component of variation, by taking the mean of the rolling means
      (last three values) for individual heifers, indicated a diurnal variation in
      cortisol concentration which was high between midnight and midmorning and low in 
      the afternoon. There were frequent sporadic "bursts' of prolactin secretion but
      these were inconsistent. There was no evidence of diurnal variation in prolactin 
      concentration, or of a temporal relationship between cortisol and prolactin
      secretion.

TI  - Measurement of human fetal breathing movements in healthy pregnancies using a
      real-time scanner.
PG  - 275-86
AB  - Real-time scanners have permitted investigators to measure fetal breathing
      movements during pregnancy in humans. It has been demonstrated that fetal
      breathing movements are episodic and occur about 30% of the time during the last 
      10 wk of pregnancy. Design of studies must account for the episodic nature of
      fetal breathing movements. It will be important to account for the relationship
      of fetal breathing movements to maternal meals, time of day, and gestational age 
      of fetuses. Furthermore, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and drugs may alter fetal
      breathing measurements. Finally, fetal breathing movements are absent during
      accelerated labor and may normally be diminished during the last 3 days prior to 
      spontaneous term labor. Measurement of fetal breathing movements using real-time 
      scanners has helped to understand circadian rhythms in fetal life and may
      ultimately be of use in the assessment of fetal health. It is important that much
      more information be obtained concerning factors that normally influence fetal
      breathing movements before proper strategies can be suggested for the use of
      these measurements in the clinical assessment of fetal health.

TI  - Development of EEG and daytime sleep patterns in low risk premature infants
      during the first year of life: longitudinal observations.
PG  - 165-71
AB  - Long daytime EEG-polygraph recordings were obtained at 36, 38, and 40 weeks
      conceptional age, weekly thereafter for 12 weeks, and at 26 and 52 weeks post
      term in 5 infants born at 30--33 weeks gestation. The babies have developed
      normally for 18--38 months. All 74 EEGs were normal for age. Derived data were
      compared with similar data from 17 normal full-term infants. The trace alternant 
      pattern disappeared earlier in the premature than in the control group (mean ages
      21.4 vs. 33.4 days post appeared earlier in the premature group (mean ages 35.4
      vs. 43.8 days; P < 0.05). There were no age differences between the groups with
      respect to (1) the shift from active sleep onset to quiet sleep onset, (2) active
      sleep and quiet sleep as percentages of total sleep time, or (3) disappearance of
      frontal sharp waves. Overall attainment of "infantile" EEG sleep patterns
      occurred at 35--60 days post term (mean 43.8) for the permature group and at
      27--66 days (mean 46.4) for the full-term group (difference not significant).
      These findings indicate that no significant errors will be made in clinical
      practice by applying the same maturational criteria to the post-term EEGs of
      prematures as to the EEGs of full-term infants.

TI  - Resolved: there exists an atropinic agent in vivo.
PG  - 801-5
AB  - It is suggested that there exists a competitive antagonist of the cholinergic
      system which is secreted during sleep, pregnancy, and acute stress. A biochemical
      model of the sleep cycle is presented. It is suggested that normally the putative
      cholinergic antagonist is metabolized rapidly upon being released from the
      cholinergic receptor. Defective metabolism of this putative cholinergic
      antagonist is hypothesized to be one cause of hypotonic schizophrenia.

TI  - Unilaterally ovariectomized pregnant mice: dieldrin induction of the hepatic
      monooxygenases and plasma progesterone levels.
PG  - 638-42
AB  - Plasma progesterone, pregnancy maintenance, gestation period, and litter size
      were measured in mice unilaterally ovariectomized on day 6 of pregnancy (plug day
      = day 0) and then treated daily with dieldrin (2 mg kg-1, p.o.). By days 15--16, 
      dieldrin had reduced the pentobarbital sleep time by 54% (P < 0.05), increased
      the liver mass by 8% (P < 0.05), and increased hepatic microsomal cytochrome
      P-450 by 66% (P < 0.05). However, the levels of plasma progesterone in the
      hemiovariectomized, dieldrin-treated mice were not different from those in the
      hemiovariectomized controls. Other experiments showed that hemiovariectomy
      decreased plasma progesterone by about 25%. Moreover, hemiovariectomy increased
      the frequency of premature delivery but it did not affect litter size; dieldrin
      treatment did not alter these effects. The failure of the induction to reduce
      plasma progesterone could result from (1) increased progesterone synthesis
      compensating for its elevated metabolism or (2) no (net) increase in progesterone
      metabolism.

TI  - Concentrations of placental lactogen in chronically catheterized ewes and fetuses
      in late pregnancy.
PG  - 27-34
AB  - The concentration of ovine placental lactogen (oPL) was measured by
      radioimmunoassay in plasma samples from chronically catheterized ewes and their
      fetuses from day 110 of gestation to term (about day 145). Concentrations of oPL 
      in the plasma of the mother and fetus were raised after surgery, and remained
      raised for 3--5 days after the operation. Concentrations of oPL were greatest in 
      the fetus at days 120--124 of gestation, and then declined until delivery. Mean
      concentrations of oPL in the fetus in late pregnancy for single, twin and triplet
      pregnancies were 101 +/- 6 (S.E.M.), 100 +/- 11 and 115 +/- 59 ng/ml respectively
      and were not significantly different. Mean concentrations of oPL in the mother in
      late pregnancy for single, twin and triplet pregnancies were 718 +/- 227, 1387
      +/- 160 and 1510 +/- 459 ng/ml respectively; the difference between these means
      was significant (P less than 0.05). Peak concentrations were noted at days
      130--139 of gestation after which concentrations fell and were significantly
      lower on the day of delivery (P less than 0.01). Concentration of oPL in the
      mother showed no circadian rhythm. The mean concentrations of oPL in maternal
      plasma during late pregnancy was significantly correlated to the combined fetal
      weight at birth (r = 0.624, P less than 0.01).

      31, 34 to 35, and 38 to 39 weeks' gestational age.
PG  - 325-34
AB  - In order to examine the relationship between circadian rhythms in different
      steroids, cortisol and estriol were measured by radioimmunoassay in maternal
      venous plasma taken at 30- to 60-minute intervals over 24 hours from nine healthy
      women at 30 to 31, 11 at 34 to 35, and 10 at 38 to 39 weeks' gestation. Maternal 
      cortisol was maximal at 0730 to 0830 hours and fell significantly to its lowest
      concentration between 1830 and 0130 hours. At 30 to 31 and 34 to 35 weeks there
      was a significant circadian rhythm in estriol concentrations which was inversely 
      related to the circadian rhythm in cortisol. At 38 to 39 weeks mean estriol
      concentrations were significantly higher than those at 30 to 31 and 34 to 35
      weeks but there was no significant circadian pattern. We concluded that there is 
      an inverse relationship between maternal cortisol and estriol at 30 to 31 and 34 
      to 35 weeks, which would be consistent with a maternal effect on fetal adrenal
      function. The increase in mean concentration and absence of circadian rhythm in
      maternal plasma estriol at term might suggest an additional positive stimulus to 
      fetal adrenal function. The existence of patterns in maternal estriol
      concentrations must be taken into account in the u;se of sequential measurements 
      of this hormone during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy.

OAB - This review has as its objective to show that the mammalian, specifically human, 
      ovulatory cycle is subject to many influences which can alter its inherent
      rhythmicity. This cyclicity is, in essence, a displaying of a pattern that is
      endogenously driven but which is also subjected to, and subject to, exogenous
      influences that alter the basic endogenous rhythm. This literature review is in 2
      sections. The first discusses 7 major aspects of the endogenous nature of the
      primate ovulatory cycle: 1) natural rhythmicity of the ovaries; 2) steroid
      production and control; 3) gonadotropin production and control; 4) prolactin
      production, effects, and control; 5) monoamine control of the gonadotropins; 6)
      autonomic innervation of ovarian tissue; and 7) metabolic influence on ovarian
      cyclicity. This section concludes with a summary of the endogenous aspects of the
      ovulatory rhythm. Secton 2 reviews 3 exogenous influences of fertility: 1)
      nutritional influences; 2) geophysical influences; and 3) childbearing and
      lactation influences on subsequent ovulation.

TI  - [Electromedical methods for pain reduction during delivery (author's transl)].
PG  - 715-23
AB  - The authors of this paper interviewed 200 pregnant women and another 200 patients
      on their own maternity ward to find out about their views and wishes regarding
      pain reducing procedures during delivery, with or without reduced consciousness
      in the course of labour. Only 13 per cent of them wanted to sleep during
      delivery, while almost 90 per cent insisted on being kept fully alert and on
      playing an active role in childbirth.--Yet, there has been growing demand for
      analgetic treatment among maternity ward patients, which, obviously, has been
      attributable to birth trauma. For example, the percentage of women who asked for 
      peridural anaesthesia grew from 36 ante-partum to 64 post-partum.--The replies
      given by the patients then were related by the authors to the results of
      transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TNS) and cerebral electric stimulation (CES).
      Both methods had good effects on more than 50 per cent of the cases and partial
      effects on 25 to 30 per cent.--The authors feel that those no-risk simple methods
      should give good results in most cases in terms of less labour pain with full
      consciousness. Other methods, with higher risk, might be reserved for patients on
      whom simple methods fail.

PG  - 15-29
AB  - The sleep EEGs of 52 children suffering from febrile seizures were recorded.
      Their waking EEGs were free of epileptic activity. Only a few patients fell
      asleep without medication, the majority received 2 mg/kg body weight of promazine
      hydrochloride. Epileptic activity occurred in the sleep EEG of 15 out of 52
      patients (29%). Exclusively short generalized paroxysms of high amplitude, mostly
      irregular and partially abortive 3-4/sec spike-wave complexes and occasional
      2.5/sec sharp-slow-wave complexes were recorded. Epileptic discharges were
      detected in the B stage in 11 patients, in the C stage in 10 patients, in the A
      stage in 7 patients and in the stage D in two patients. They were recorded more
      often in cases where more than one seizure had occurred, and where the patients
      were more than two years of age. Generalized spikes and waves were also seen most
      frequently in the case of so-called complicated febrile convulsions. Although
      there were differences in the cases of females, in incidences of a family history
      of seizures and delayed toilet training, these were not statistical significant. 
      Likewise, a complicated pregnancy and birth as well as a delayed stato-motoric
      development showed no correlation. These results together with other findings
      justify the conclusion, that the majority of febrile convulsions should be
      classified amongst the primary generalized epilepsies.

PG  - 301-3
AB  - Female mice (genetically heterogeneous stock) were fed milled mouse food
      containing 3 g/kg phenobarbital (PhB) and water as their only nutritional source 
      from gestation days 9-18. Control dams received milled food and water. Blood PhB 
      levels of treated females and fetuses were 40-200 microgram/ml. At the age of 50 
      days, male offspring were injected with 3.5 g/kg ethanol. Sleep time was
      monitored and in randomly selected individuals, brain ethanol levels were
      determined upon awakening. To assess the rate of metabolism in the treated and
      control offspring, blood ethanol levels were determined in other randomly
      selected individuals at 60 and 120 min post-injection. Offspring who received PhB
      prenatally were resistant to the hypnotic effects of ethanol as evidenced by
      their 33% shorter sleep time compared to controls (P less than 0.001). The brain 
      ethanol levels upon awakening were higher than control in the offspring born to
      the barbiturate-treated mothers (P less than 0.001), indicating that the
      resistance to ethanol was due to factors residing within the central nervous
      system.

TI  - Central nervous system maturation in the stressed premature.
PG  - 518-22
AB  - The developmental sequence of sleep cycles has been found to be a useful index of
      central nervous system maturation in premature infants. To determine the effects 
      of severe reversible stress on the maturation of sleep cycles, 6- to 8-hour sleep
      studies were done on 10 premature infants with severe hyaline membrane disease
      (HMD) and 10 healthy premature babies. The studies were done in the neonatal
      intensive care unit and included patients from 30 weeks' gestation to term and in
      all stages of the disease. Prior studies were confirmed showing that percentage
      of quiet sleep increases, transitional sleep changes little, and active sleep
      decreases from 30 weeks' gestation to term. In infants with severe HMD, the
      percentage of quiet sleep was less and active sleep higher than in unstressed
      infants of similar age who acted as controls. Once the infants recovered from
      HMD, sleep patterns became similar to those found in the control group. These
      data suggest that when respiratory distress occurs in the premature infant, there
      is a transient delay in central nervous system maturation as measured by sleep
      cycle analysis.

TI  - Circadian rhythms in maternal plasma cortisol, estrone, estradiol, and estriol at
      34 to 35 weeks' gestation.
PG  - 791-8
AB  - In order to examine the relationship between circadian rhythms in different
      steroids, cortisol (F), estrone E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3) were
      measured by radioimmunoassay in maternal venous plasma taken at 30 to 60-minute
      intervals over 24 hours from 11 healthy women at 34 to 35 weeks' gestation.
      Maternal F was maximal at 0730 hours and fell significantly to its lowest
      concentration at 0230 hours. Maretnal E3 was lowest between 1000 and 1130 hours
      and rose significantly to maximal values between 2230 and 0030 hours. Maternal E1
      was maximal between 1000 and 1130 hours and showed a significant decrease to
      reach its lowest concentration at 0430 to 0630 hours. No significant circadian
      change was measured in uncorrected concentrations of E2. We conclude that there
      is an inverse relationship between maternal F and E3, which would be consistent
      with a maternal effect on fetal adrenal function, and the existence of circadian 
      rhythms in F, E1, E2, and E3 must be taken into account in clinical
      investigations of these hormones during pregnancy.

TI  - Correlation of plasma non-conjugated oestriol and plasma cortisol in late human
      pregnancy.
PG  - 553-9
AB  - The present study concerns the diurnal variations of free plasma oestriol and
      their relationship to maternal plasma cortisol in late human pregnancy. Four
      pregnant women volunteered for the study. According to the half-life time of
      oestriol blood was drawn at intervals of 30 and 60 minutes, respectively, over a 
      period of 24 hours. Free oestriol was measured by radioimmunoassay and cortisol
      was quantitated by a protein binding method. All patients exhibited a circadian
      rhythm for free oestriol with higher values in the evening and early night (14.4 
      +/- 3.7 ng/ml) than in the morning (11.3 +/- 2.3 ng/ml, P less than 0.001). The
      course of oestriol followed plasma cortisol in a significant negative correlation
      (r = -0.566, P less than 0.001). During the period of low cortisol concentration 
      oestriol levels demonstrated the phenomenon of episodic secretion. The results
      suggest that the maternal adrenals predominantly regulate the circadian rhythm of
      free oestriol by a negative feed-back action on the foetal hypothalamus.

TI  - Pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein levels in normal and toxemic pregnancy.
PG  - 606-10
AB  - Maternal plasma levels of pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein (PSBG) in 166
      normal and 169 toxemic pregnancies were measured by radioimmunoassay in the third
      trimester. Individual PSBG levels were studied in 16 women during weeks 7 through
      39 of normal pregnancy. The levels were found to increase as pregnancy
      progressed. During the third trimester neither normal nor toxemic pregnancies
      showed any circadian rhythm in PSBG levels. In toxemic pregnancies low PSBG
      values were seen mainly in cases with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).
      Plasma PSBG concentrations at weeks 39-40 in toxemic patients correlated
      positively with placental weight. No such correlation was found in normal or
      toxemic pregnancies at 37-38 weeks or in either group between PSBG level and
      infant birth weight, birth length, or Apgar score. In toxemic pregnancies with
      low PSBG values during the last trimester, birth weights were somewhat lower than
      in those with normal levels. Thus, low levels of maternal plasma PSBG may reflect
      IUGR, but will be of little value for assessment of fetal condition at birth.

TI  - The effects of abdominal loading on rib cage distortion in premature infants.
PG  - 425-8
AB  - The action of the diaphragm in inspiration is to decrease intrathoracic pressure 
      and raise abdominal pressure, which elevates the rib cage. In the supine
      position, the rise in abdominal pressure is smaller because of the lack of
      abdominal muscle tone. In premature infants the inward pull of the diaphragm on
      the very compliant ribs causes inward movement on inspiration (ie, distortion)
      which is exacerbated by the lack of intercostal muscle activity during rapid eye 
      movement (REM) sleep, their predominant state. We raised abdominal pressure by
      means of an inflatable cuff in 12 newborn infants (gestation 28 to 40 weeks) to
      try to improve inspiratory coupling of the rib cage and diaphragm. There was no
      significant change in minute ventilation, indicating no ventilatory impairment.
      In all studies in which there was distortion, abdominal loading produced a
      reduction or abolition of distortion (P less than .01). Abdominal loading may be 
      useful in reducing diaphragmatic activity in premature infants.

TI  - The effect of maternal posture, meals and time of day on fetal movements.
PG  - 717-23
AB  - During the last 3 to 4 months of their pregnancies, six healthy mothers provided 
      a daily record of their own activity together with the amount of fetal movement. 
      Fetal movement increased throughout most of the daytime to reach a peak in the
      evening. The mothers detected most movement when they were lying, less when they 
      were sitting and least when they were standing. Later in the day the mothers were
      less likely to be standing and more likely to be sitting; when fetal movement was
      measured with the mother in the sitting posture, more movement occurred as the
      day progressed. Mealtimes did not have any effect upon movement. Some
      implications of these findings, both for the assessment of fetal well-being and
      for theories of the development of circadian rhythms in the infant, are
      discussed.

PG  - 325-7
AB  - HS/Ibg (heterogeneous stock) mice dams were fed milled mouse food containing 3
      g/kg phenobarbital (PhB) in acid form and water as their only nutritional source 
      from gestation days 9--19. Control females received milled food and water. Blood 
      PhB levels of treated females and fetuses were 40--200 micrograms/ml blood. At
      the age of 50 days, male offspring were injected with C14 -sodium pentobarbital
      (PenB) (50 mg/kg). Sleep time and temperature loss were monitored and, in
      randomly selected individuals, brain PenB levels were determined upon awakening. 
      The experiment was repeated on the same animals for 3 consecutive days. All
      offspring developed functional (central nervous system) tolerance during the 3
      testing days as evidenced by the daily decrease in sleep time while brain levels 
      of PenB upon awakening increased (P less than 0.001). Offspring who received PhB 
      prenatally had generally shorter sleep times, less temperature loss, and higher
      brain PenB levels upon awakening than controls. The differences were most
      pronounced on the second day (sleep time reduced 27%, P less than 0.001;
      temperature loss 47%, P less than 0.001; brain PhB levels increased 23%, P less
      than 0.01).

TI  - Effects of maternal drinking on neonate state regulation.
PG  - 464-73
AB  - Sleep-awake state distribution during inter-feed intervals over a 24-hour period 
      on the third day of life was investigated by means of a continuous non-intrusive 
      bassinet sleep monitor. 31 infants were studied: 14 born to mothers who drank
      heavily throughout pregnancy (group A), eight whose mothers modified their heavy 
      drinking (group B) and nine whose mothers never were heavy drinkers (group C).
      Over the 24-hour period, group A infants slept less than those in group B. In
      comparison with group C, group A infants had a larger proportion of quiet sleep
      episodes interrupted by awake or unclassified epochs, and were more restless,
      with more frequent major body movements. These pilot observations suggest that
      heavy maternal consumption of alcohol, when continued throughout pregnancy, is
      associated with a disturbance of sleep-awake state distribution. Successful
      therapy of heavy drinking during pregnancy may improve the physiological
      competence of the newborn to regulate sleep-awake states and facilitate
      interaction between mother and infant.

TI  - Diurnal variations in unconjugated and total plasma estriol levels in late normal
      pregnancy.
PG  - 623-6
AB  - Diurnal variations in plasma unconjugated and total estriol were assessed in 11
      third-trimester subjects with uncomplicated pregnancies. Commercially available
      125I-labeled radioimmunoassay kits were used. Total plasma estriols reach a nadir
      during the hours of sleep (400 and 700 hours) which exceeds the episodic
      fluctuations seen from day to day or during a given 90-minute period. Plasma
      unconjugated estriol fluctuations over 24 hours did not significantly exceed our 
      previously reported episodic fluctuation of 15.6 +/- 8.2%. The data are
      interpreted as showing no circadian rhythm, but reflecting, in the case of total 
      plasma estriols, an effect of improved renal clearance during hours of rest.
      Plasma unconjugated estriol emerges as the test of choice in the monitoring of
      high-risk pregnancies.

TI  - Laboratory assessment of prolactin status.
PG  - 113-21
AB  - The laboratory assessment of prolactin status was evaluated by detailed study of 
      921 subjects (587 normal subjects and 334 patients with pathological conditions).
      The effect on serum prolactin levels of age, sex, circadian rhythm, pulsatility
      of secretion, stress, drug ingestion, and pregnancy was defined in normal
      subjects. The normal prolactin responses to stimulation (TRH metoclopramide) and 
      suppression (L-dopa, bromocriptine) were also determined. Basal prolactin levels 
      were measured in patients with defined pathological conditions including
      prolactinoma, idiopathic hyperprolactinaemia, acromegaly, Cushing's disease,
      chronic renal failure, primary hypothyroidism, pituitary ablation, Kallman's
      syndrome, Nelson's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, gonadotrophin deficiency,
      craniopharyngioma, panhypopituitarism, and chronic progressive arthropathy. Based
      on these data, a strategy for the routine laboratory assessment of prolactin
      status is outlined.

TI  - Circadian rhythm of free oestradiol in relation to plasma cortisol in late human 
      pregnancy.
PG  - 519-24
AB  - The present study investigates the diurnal variations of free plasma oestradiol
      levels in late human pregnancy. The oestradiol levels are correlated to the
      maternal adrenal function as reflected by the plasma levels of cortisol.
      According to the half life time of oestradiol, blood samples were collected at
      short time intervals of 30 and 60 min, respectively. Three pregnant women
      volunteered in the study. Free oestradiol was measured by radioimmunoassay and
      cortisol was quantitated by a protein binding method. All patients exhibited a
      circadian rhythm for free oestradiol with significantly higher values in the
      early morning (28.3 +/- 7.2 ng/ml) than in the afternoon and early night (21.2
      +/- 3.6 ng/ml, P less than 0.001). The course of oestradiol followed in a
      moderate but significant correlation plasma cortisol (r = 0.34, P less than
      0.001). During the period of increasing cortisol the oestradiol levels
      demonstrated the phenomenon of episodic secretion. The results obtained suggest
      that the maternal adrenals predominantly regulate the diurnal rhythm of free
      oestradiol in late human pregnancy.

TI  - Interactions of endogenous rhythms during postnatal development. Observations of 
      behaviour and polygraphic studies in one normal infant.
PG  - 179-89
AB  - The spontaneous sleep-waking behaviour of a male infant, normal with respect to
      pregnancy, delivery and Apgar score, was observed continuously from birth till
      the first four months of life. Additionally sleep stages were registered
      polygraphically during several weeks. The infant was allowed to sleep and awake
      according to his own schedule. It could be demonstrated that the spontaneous
      sleep-waking behaviour was mainly driven by 3 endogenous rhythms : The Basic rest
      activity cycle with a period of about 50 minutes, a 4-hour cycle already
      established during the first 2 weeks of life and a circadian rhythm which
      developed during the second month of life. So far the presented results support
      earlier studies of Kleitman and Engelmann, Sterman and Hoppenbrouwers, Hellbrugge
      etc. The present study, however, gives further evidence, that these rhythms do
      not run independently, but constitute a system of interacting oscillators.

PG  - 20-5
AB  - The influence of the herbicide balagrin on the maternal organism and fetus was
      experimentally studied on 60 pregnant albino rats of Wistar line. The preparation
      was given orally throughout the entire gestation period in daily doses of 1/1o - 
      110 mg/kg, 1/20 - 55 mg/kg and 1/50 - 22 mg/kg of LD50 - 1100 mg/kg. The
      detoxifying function was studied by the duration of hexabarbital sleep, the
      excretory function - by the cholic acid content in the bile, and the enzymatic
      function - by the dehydrogenase activities: LDH, MDH, LDH, GL-6-PDH in the liver 
      of pregnant animals and the fetus, Marked toxic effect on the maternal and fetal 
      organism was demonstrable at all balagrin application levels by the liver
      function disturbances.

OAB - Second trimester interruption of pregnancy through D&E (dilatation and
      evacuation) procedure has been used at the Boulder (Colorado) Abortion Clinic
      with an exceedingly low complication rate, lower than abortion with
      prostaglandins or saline solution infusion. However, according to a doctor who
      has performed more than 300 such abortions, while the procedure is easier
      emotionally for the patient since she does not have to deliver a fetus which may 
      have signs of life, it produces intense psychological reactions on doctors and on
      assisting nurses. 15 members of the Boulder Abortion Clinic were polled to obtain
      reactions to the D&E procedure. Many subjects reported serious emotional
      reactions which produced physiological symptoms, sleep disturbances, effects on
      personal relationships, moral anguish, conscious stress, and unconscious
      manifestations such as dreams. A few respondents expressed feelings of resentment
      and irritation toward patients who waited so long before seeking abortion, and
      most felt a deep sympathy for doctors performing the procedure, and a desire to
      protect them from the trauma of having to view the fetus. It was observed that
      many of those capable of performing or assisting with the procedure are having
      strong personal reservations about participating in an operation which they view 
      as destructive and violent.

TI  - Plasma cortisol in the chronic rhesus monkey preparation (Macaca mulatta).
PG  - 421-4
AB  - The short- and long-term effects of surgical procedures and chair restraint on
      total plasma cortisol were assessed in the chronic rhesus monkey preparation.
      Three nonpregnant and six pregnant animals were sampled daily, morning and
      evening. Fetal plasma specimens were obtained simultaneously from the pregnant
      animals. In the nonpregnant rhesus monkey, a circadian rhythm is present the day 
      following venous catheterization and chair restraint, with individual values
      similar to those in trained, unanesthetized animals. In the pregnant animals, a
      postoperative rise in cortisol is followed by a gradual decline to a plateau and 
      a return of circadian rhythm. No consistent daily fluctuations are seen in fetal 
      cortisol, and although correlated with maternal cortisol, the exact relationship 
      is uncertain. The data indicate that operation, as expected, is stressful but
      acclimation to the chair occurs.

TI  - A biological oscillator system and the development of sleep-waking behavior
      during early infancy.
PG  - 425-40
AB  - The sleep-waking behavior of a male infant, normal with respect to pregnancy,
      delivery and Apgar score, was observed continuously from birth till the first 4
      months of life. The infant was allowed to sleep and awake according to his own
      schedule and was fed only if his behavior could be judged as a feeding demand.
      Using several methods of computerized analysis it could be demonstrated that the 
      spontaneous sleep-waking behavior was mainly driven by two endogenous rhythms, an
      ultradian cycle and a circadian one. While the ultradian rhythm was already
      established at term showing a mean period of 4 h, the circadian variation
      developed during the first 3 months of life. So far our results support earlier
      studies (KLEITMAN and ENGELMANN; PARMELEE; HELLBRUGGE,). The present paper,
      however, gives further evidence that both rhythms do not run independently, but
      seem to constitute a system of connected oscillators. As soon as the circadian
      rhythm is manifestly developed, the period of the ultradian rhythm seems to be
      modulated according to circadian variations. More specifically, during the
      nocturnal phase of the circadian rhythm the ultradian rhythm decelerated. By
      contrast, during the diurnal phase the ultradian cycle was accelerated. Using
      circadian frequency modulation of the ultradian cycle as the underlying
      principle, a computerized model of both connected oscillators was developed. The 
      theoretically predicted sleep-waking behavior was compared to the behavior
      actually observed in the infant of this study. During postnatal development the
      coupled rhythms cause characteristic periodicities of the sleep-waking pattern.
      Since the infant experiences his world within a basic framework of sleep and
      waking spans, the different periodicities may be considered as a structure timing
      the information process in the developing brain.

TI  - Progesterone and corticosteroids in the initiation of lactation in the sow.
PG  - 517-25
AB  - The concentration of lactose in the mammary secretion from individual glands of
      two sows increased significantly (P less than 0.01) between 0 and 24 h after
      parturition. In six sows studied during the perinatal period there was a negative
      correlation (r = -0.80; P less than 0.02) at parturition between the
      concentration of progesterone in the blood and the concentration of lactose in
      the mammary secretion. Furthermore, the increase in concentration of lactose in
      the mammary secretion after parturition was related to the timing of the decline 
      of plasma progesterone to low levels. The results indicate that the initiation of
      lactation occurs within 24 h of parturition in most sows, and the results are
      consistent with the hypothesis that progesterone withdrawal acts as the
      'trigger'. Neither the changes in corticosteroid binding globulin nor the changes
      in total corticosteroids were temporally related to the initiation of lactation. 
      However, a circadian rhythm was observed for total corticosteroids in the blood
      of three out of nine lactating and pregnant sows, whereas no circadian rhythm was
      observed in progesterone of the four pregnant sows. The results are discussed in 
      relation to the disease complex mastitis-metritis-agalactia.

PG  - 353-4
AB  - Human embryonic neutrophils (N) in the liver (from 8.5 mm crown-rump length) are 
      alkaline phosphatase (AP) negative during the first trimester of pregnancy. Early
      bone marrow granulocytes (from eleventh to sixteenth weeks of gestation) behave
      similarly. Only a small percentage of slightly AP positive cells could be found. 
      Occasional cells with strong NAP reaction appear in the second trimester. NAP
      positivity greatly increases in the third trimester and term-babies have a
      somewhat higher than normal NAP activity in circulating blood. Unlike NAP
      reaction, naphthol-AS-D-chloroacetate esterase and peroxidase reactions are
      positive even in the earliest (AP negative) neutrophils.

TI  - [Bio-rhythmic as time-structure of postnatal development: observation in
      behaviour and polygraphic studies in a normal newborn (author's transl)].
PG  - 97-106
AB  - The spontaneous sleep-waking behaviour of a male infant, normal with respect to
      pregnancy, delivery and Apgar score, was observed continuously from birth till
      the first four months of life. Additionally sleep stages were scored by means of 
      polygraphic method during several weeks. The infant was allowed to sleep and
      awake according to his own schedule and was fed if his behaviour could be judged 
      as a feeding demand. Using statistical analysis it could be deomonstrated, that
      the spontaneous sleep-waking behaviour was mainly driven by three endogenous
      rhythms: The Basic rest aktivity cycle with periods of about 50 minutes, a
      circafour-hour rhythm already established at term and a circadian periodicity
      which developed during the first three months of life. So far our results support
      earlier studies of Kleitman and Engelmann, Parmelee, Hellbrugge etc. The present 
      study, however, gives further evidence, that these rhythms do not run
      independently, but constitute a system of interacting oscillators. During
      postnatal development these connected rhythms cause characteristic periodicities 
      of the spontaneous sleep-waking pattern. Since the newborn experiences his world 
      within a basic framework of sleep and waking epochs, the system of interacting,
      endogenous rhythms may be considered as a structure timing the information
      process in the developing brain.

TI  - Olfactory reflexes in the newborn infant.
PG  - 624-6
AB  - Clinical responses to peppermint odor were observed in 100 healthy term and
      preterm infants during active sleep on two successive days. Thirty-six
      asphyxiated term infants and three infants with holoprosencephaly also were
      tested. Olfactory reflexes were regularly elicited in normal infants after 32
      weeks' gestation, but some premature infants as young as 28 weeks also responded.
      Responses included initiation of sucking and arousal-withdrawal. Habituation
      occurred after two or three trials. A Moro response was seen only in a few
      asphyxiated infants; loss of olfactory reflexes appeared to parallel suppression 
      of brainstem reflexes. Olfactory reflexes are useful in excluding cerebral
      malformations associated with agenesis of the olfactory bulbs.

TI  - Fetal response to periodic sleep apnea: a new syndrome in obstetrics.
PG  - 77-81
AB  - Periodic sleep apnea, a chronic sleep deprivation state, in which marked changes 
      in the arterial PO2 and PCO2 tensions have been recorded, is a relatively new
      syndrome not previously reported in pregnancy. It is characterized by episodes of
      apnea, prevalently obstructive, during sleep. The majority of patients with this 
      syndrome have snored heavily for years, suggesting a causal relationship between 
      snoring and periodic sleep apnea. The effects of prolonged snoring on alveolar
      ventilation and systemic pressure(s) suggest that this snoring has
      physiopathological implications on maternal cardio-respiratory reserve and
      indirectly upon the fetus, especially as there are recordable changes in fetal
      heart rate and also a change in the acid-base status of the fetus. The
      possibility that this syndrome may have an adverse effect upon the fetus is
      stressed.

TI  - Sleep disorders and insomnia.
PG  - 165-9
AB  - Primary sleep disorders include narcolepsy, the Pickwickian syndrome, sleep apnea
      in infants and other rare conditions. Secondary sleep disorders occur in
      depression, alcoholism, endocrinopathies, heart failure and pregnancy. Medical
      symptomatology often increases during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, when
      physiologic activity is high. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, requires 
      careful work-up, attempts at environmental manipulation and judicious short-term 
      pharmacotherapy. Pharmacologic manipulation of sleep is beset with complications.
      A basic understanding of properties and side effects of the sleep-inducing drugs 
      is needed in order to select the optimal agent.

TI  - Cord serum prolactin in relation to the time of the day, the sex of the neonate
      and the birth weight.
PG  - 241-7
AB  - Serum prolactin was measured in 581 blood samples collected immediately after
      birth from 563 single new-born and from 9 pairs of twins. Cord serum prolactin is
      high at birth: the mean level is some 5 times higher than in adults. There is no 
      sex difference in cord serum prolactin concentration in the neonate. Mean serum
      prolactin is significantly higher at 1.00 and 2.00 a.m. Thus a circadian
      periodicity in serum prolactin concentration seems to appear already during
      foetal life well before the organization of sleep rhythm. Cord serum prolactin
      increases with birth weight ranging from 1500 g to 3500 g. Thus, the control of
      levels of circulating prolactin changes during foetal life resulting in a
      progressive increase starting from mid-pregnancy. Mean cord serum prolactin at
      birth is lower in twins than in single new-borns. There is no significant
      difference in serum prolactin between the first and the second twin.

AB  - Effects of maternal administration of alpha-methyl-L-DOPA on sleep in utero were 
      studied by polygraphic method in Guinea Pig faetus from the 53th day of
      gestation. Maternal injection of alpha-methyl-L-DOPA (100 and 200 mg/kg) produces
      a typical sedative effect on the faetus from the first hour after drug
      administration. But, effects appear attenuated in comparison to those of the
      new-born Guinea Pig: a paradoxical sleep-deprivation of only 30% is observed
      during the 12 hours period after drug injection. Causes of the attenuation in
      utero of these drug effects are discussed.

PG  - 302-15
AB  - This study is the statement of the present knowledge of the normal EEG activity
      of the full term and the premature neonates. The criteria for normality of the
      records are based on transversal studies of normal newborn babies, born after a
      normal pregnancy and a normal delivery (Apgar 9 and 10). Follow up studies of
      children over of period of 3 years or more have allowed to appreciate the
      variability of the neonatal EEG, especially in premature babies having a later
      normal psycho-motor development. The variability of bioelectric activity is
      considerable from child to child and in the same child from one moment to another
      especially during quiet sleep. EEG activity varies according to the states of
      vigilance and sleep. Organisation of sleep is independent of the recording
      methods, as shown by a comparative study using different technics of electrode
      application.

TI  - Fetal evaluation by real-time imaging.
PG  - 339-49
AB  - The application of real-time imaging to the study of fetal morphology and
      function is an exciting advance. Rapid accurate study of fetal dynamics is
      possible with this apparently safe, noninvasive technique. Animal studies have
      revealed the general physiology of fetal breathing movements, which are now under
      extensive investigation with real-time imaging in the human. There is evidence
      for circadian rhythm of human fetal breathing movements as well as a relationship
      to maternal substrate loading. The presence of fetal breathing movements of the
      rapid irregular type may be a reassuring sign in the presence of other indicators
      of fetal compromise. Using real-time B-scan imaging, we have found long periods
      of apnea in pregnancies with normal perinatal outcome. As suggested in the animal
      studies, changes in fetal breathing patterns prior to fetal death may be more
      complex than originally thought. The techique of real-time B-scan imaging with
      precise definition of apnea, general movements, and fetal breathing will provide 
      valuable information on which to base our evaluation of the clinical usefulness
      of fetal breathing movement studies in the management of pregnancy.

AB  - The development of 40 postterm, postmature infants was compared to that of 40
      normal control infants during the first year of life. The postterm, postmature
      infants had more prenatal complications and received lower Brazelton interaction 
      and motor scores at birth. At four months they scored lower on the Denver
      developmental scale and were rated "difficult" babies by their mothers. At eight 
      months their Bayley motor scores were equivalent to those of the control infants,
      but their mental scores were lower. At this time their mothers reported a higher 
      incidence of illnesses and of feeding and sleep disturbances.

TI  - Sleep state, apnea and bradycardia in pre-term infants.
PG  - 160-8
AB  - Respiratory pattern and heart rate were studied in 28 pre-term infants and four
      full-term infants during the first weeks of life. Sleep state was identified by
      standard neurological and EEG criteria. Apneic spells lasting 10 seconds or more 
      were most frequent in the least mature infants, and their frequency tended to
      diminish with increasing maturity. When these apneic attacks were related to
      sleep state they were found to occur more frequently during non-REM sleep in
      infants of 30 to 33 weeks gestation. This was the only statistically significant 
      difference found. No over-all pattern relating sleep state to frequency of apnea 
      could be detected for individual infants. It was also difficult to relate the
      occurrence of bradycardia to apnea in terms of sleep state or gestational age. It
      is concluded that no simple relationship between sleep state, apnea and
      bradycardia exists and that a complex interrelation between central and
      peripheral factors is involved in these events.

TI  - Fertility and offspring survival in mice selected for different sensitivities to 
      alcohol.
PG  - 95-103
AB  - The LS (long-sleep) and SS (short-sleep) selected lines of mice exhibit
      relatively high and low sensitivity to alcohol, respectively, because of their
      previous history of selective breeding. The present study identifies other
      differences between the two lines. SS animals are almost twice as fertile as LS
      animals. Analysis of vaginal plug formation suggested that higher sexual activity
      of SS mice is an important component of their greater fertility. Forced maternal 
      drinking of a 10% ethanol solution during gestation, and especially during
      lactation, caused a decrease in survival of LS but not of SS offspring. Increased
      cannibalism of pups by LS mothers was probably an important component of this
      decrease in progeny survival. Maternal consumption of liquid in both lines was
      decreased during gestation, and especially during lactation, when 10% ethanol was
      the only available liquid in each case. The physiological basis for decreased
      survival of LS progeny may involve either direct effects of alcohol on progeny or
      indirect effects caused by water, nutritional, or hormonal imbalance in LS
      mothers when they are exposed to alcohol stress. The relationship of fertility
      and progeny survival differences in the two lines to their differences in alcohol
      sensitivity produced by selective breeding is discussed.

TI  - [Problems in dose finding from the view of the clinical pharmacologist (author's 
      transl)].
PG  - 264-72
AB  - The dose of a drug applied to a patient is determined by his physiological and
      pathological data, by specific properties of the drug and by the mode of
      application. The most important physiological data which influence the dose are
      body weight, sex, age, a pregnancy, genetic variations and circadian rhythm.
      Pathological findings such as organ insufficiencies (kidneys, heart, liver,
      endocrinium, transport protein in the blood, etc.) are also to be considered.
      Particularities of the drug kinetics (insignificant absorption, excessive
      biological half-life, specific affinities to tissues, etc.), of metabolism
      (first-pass effect, toxic metabolites, saturable detoxification, stress, etc.) or
      a high toxicity are other parameters of consequence. Finally attention has to be 
      paid to the mode of application (p.o., i.v., etc.), to the kind of galenic
      preparation (liquid or solid, slow-releasing preparation, etc.), to interactions 
      if using combinations of drugs and to a long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Aditional
      problems are encountered in clinical trials especially in early phases while
      determining the tolerable therapeutic dose.

TI  - 24-hour rhythms in uterine and umbilical blood flows of conscious pregnant sheep.
PG  - 288-98
AB  - The possibility that 24-hour rhythms exist in uterine blood flow (UtBF) and
      umbilical blood (UmBF) was investigated in 5 days postoperative chronically
      instrumented near-term pregnant sheep acclimated to a controlled environment.
      UtBF, UmBF and pressure measurements were made at 15-min intervals over 24 h
      beginning at 0800 h. Each data series was examined for the presence of
      significant rhythms of a 24-hour period using a method of Fourier analysis. UtBF 
      24-hour rhythms were found in all ewes; UmBF 24-hour rhythms were found in 4 of 5
      lambs. A consistent reciprocal phase relationship between UtBF and UmBF was
      evident within animals. There were no associated rhythms in maternal arterial,
      fetal arterial, or amniotic fluid pressures. These results indicate that the
      presence of circadian rhythms must be considered as a possible variable when
      long-term uteroplacental hemodynamic studies are planned.

TI  - Endometrial content of nuclear estrogen receptor and receptivity for
      ovoimplantation in the rat.
PG  - 470-5
AB  - The purpose of this study was to provide information concerning the amount of
      nuclear binding sites for estrogen in endometrial cells during the first week of 
      pregnancy in the rat. The "insoluble" (high-salt non-extractable) binding during 
      the first four days of pregnancy follows a circadian rhythm, with a maximal value
      at midnight, and a minimal one a noon. By day 5, the amount plateaus at a minimal
      value. The number of estradiol binding sites of the soluble (high-salt
      extractable) nuclear fraction shows a similar pattern. All the necessary elements
      for the estrogen-dependent induction of endometrial receptivity for nidation
      appear, therefore, to be present already by day 3, but the turning on of the
      endometrial response to estrogen on day 4 seems to depend on additional
      factor(s).

      (meperidine). Acepromazine and thiopental partially disrupted the foetal sleep
      cycle by synchronization of the ECoG for 1-2 h but increased the heart rate for
      2-3 h. The effects of meperidine were similar but lasted only 5-10 min for the
      ECoG and less than 0.5 h for the heart rate.

TI  - [Prevention of epilepsy in children following birth trauma].
PG  - 153-6
AB  - In a group of 120 children with prenatal and postnatal trauma 31 children with
      epileptic seizures were found who accounted for 25.8% of neuropsychiatric
      complications in this group. Epilepsy was more frequent in children with a
      history of asphyxia than after other forms of perinatal trauma. Seizures were
      observed either immediately after birth or up to the age of 100 months. In
      children with delayed onset of seizures evidence of abnormal behaviour with
      excessive motor agitation, sleep and appetite disturbances was found from the
      very birth. Besides prophylactic measures applied to avoid complications of
      pregnancy and labour it is indispensable to separate the children with perinatal 
      trauma and group them for further neuropsychiatric observation in outpatient
      clinics and to begin treatment which may prevent development of frank epilepsy in
      at least a part of these children and may contribute to better rehabilitation of 
      brain-damaged children.

PG  - 547-52
AB  - Total protein and the socalled classical blood plasma fractions were examined in 
      hourly intervals over 24 hours in ten clinically intact pregnant Jersey cows. The
      average total protein values recorded from the plasma samples were 6.9 per cent
      and thus physiologically normal. The arithmetic mean values within one circadian 
      rhythm did not differ markedly within each of the following fractions:albumin
      (38.7 +/- 5.08) alpha1-globulin (11.22 +/- 2.22),alpha2-globulin (14.25 +/-
      1.95), and beta-globulins (12.56 +/- 0.91). Moderate rises were established only 
      for the gamma-globulins at 1 a.m., 7 a.m., and 7 p.m. The protein fractions of
      blood plasma, consequently, are not subject to any circadian rhythm, and the time
      of blood sampling, therefore, has no bearings on laboratory diagnosis.

TI  - [On the circadian changes of concentration of free amino acids in pregnancy
      (author's transl)].
PG  - 11-5
AB  - Concentrations of 17 free amino acids were measured in the serum of 15 healthy
      pregnant women at the end of pregnancy in intervals of 4--5 h. A circadian rhythm
      with its concentration peak at 5 p.m. could be observed for Ser, Val, Met, Ile,
      Leu, His, Lys and Arg. Exogenic and endogenic synchronizators are being discussed
      as possible causes for these fluctuations during the day. The rhythm of the free 
      amino acids makes it necessary that only fasting blood is examined and that the
      time of day is always registered when the blood specimen is taken.

TI  - Monoamine oxidase and free tryptophan in human plasma: normal variations and
      their implications for biochemical research in affective disorders.
PG  - 310-7
AB  - A methodological study of healthy subjects was conducted to investigate factors
      influencing plasma free tryptophan and platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity.
      The following changes were found during the menstrual cycle: free tryptophan was 
      lower during the "ovulatory" phase than during the "premenstrual" phase, MAO
      activity was 20% lower during the "premenstrual" phase as compared with the
      "neutral" phase (days: menses-24 to -1). During pregnancy MAO activity was also
      lower than the values found six weeks postpartum. MAO activity in women was
      significantly higher than in men and exhibited greater variability. A circadian
      rhythm for free tryptophan was observed (minimum at midday, maximum at midnight).
      No diurnal variation in MAO activity could be established. Preliminary data from 
      untreated endogenous depressive patients showed no difference in free tryptophan 
      concentrations at 8 a.m. or 4 p.m. from control values.

TI  - Ontogenesis of a biological clock for serotonin:acetyl coenzyme A
      N-acetyltransferase in pineal gland of rat.
PG  - 2814-8
AB  - Serotonin:acetyl coenzyme A N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.5) Activity in pineal
      gland was assayed in rats which were born and raised under diurnal lighting
      conditions, in continuous darkness, or in constant light. N-Acetyltransferase
      activity in the pups raised under diurnal lighting showed a rhythmic pattern,
      with high enzyme activity during dark period. The pups raised in continuous
      darkness also showed a rhythmic pattern, the phase of which was delayed by 8 hr
      in 7-week-old pups; the rhythmic phase of N-acetyltransferase began in the
      evening in 12-day-old pups and was regularly delayed by 1 hr every week. The pups
      raised in constant illumination also showed a rhythmic pattern; the rhythmic
      phase was delayed by 3 hr every week. When the mother rats were coupled in
      darkness and maintained in darkness during pregnancy and after the pups were
      born, their pups again showed a rhythmic pattern. These observations indicate
      that the biological clock for N-acetyltransferase is generated independently of
      environmental lighting. When mothers were coupled under reversed lighting
      conditions and transferred into darkness or light, the rhythmic pattern in their 
      pups was inverted 180 degrees from that of pups born of diurnal mothers. When the
      pups were raised in darkness, the rhythmic phase of N-acetyltransferase in the
      pups was similar to that of their mothers. It is suggested that in the absence of
      light-darkness cycle, the mother rat sets the rhythm of the pups to synchronize
      with her own rhythm. When pups were reared by a foster mother with a different
      rhythmic pattern from that of their original mother, the rhythmic phase in the
      pups was closer to that of the original mother, suggesting that the original
      mother plays the predominant role setting the rhythm of the pups.

TI  - Twenty-four hour prolactin (PRL) secretory patterns during pregnancy.
PG  - 1117-20
AB  - To determine if the central nervous system "program" controlling PRL secretion is
      operative during pregnancy, three pregnant women (12th, 20th and 32nd week of
      gestation) had 24-hour, 20-minute interval plasma sampling and polygraphic
      monitoring of nocturnal sleep. All three subjects showed episodic PRL secretion
      during waking which became augmented during nocturnal sleep. Since the number of 
      "major" PRL secretory episodes was similar to normals, the increased PRL levels
      were most probably achieved by increased secretion per secretory episode. These
      findings suggest that during pregnancy, the PRL sleep related secretory "program"
      is maintained in a qualitative manner, albeit at a higher set-point.

TI  - Etomidate, a potent non-barbiturate hypnotic. Intravenous etomidate in mice,
      rats, guinea-pigs, rabbits and dogs.
PG  - 92 -132
AB  - Etomidate, R-(+)-ethyl-1-(1-phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate was found to 
      be a potent, short-acting and safe hypnotic; when given intravenously in single
      doses to mice, rats, guinea-pigs, rabbits and dogs. In rats of different body
      weight (50, 100, 200 and 300 g) two injection rates were used (2 sec and 2 min). 
      By rapid iv injection in rats of 200 g etomidate (ED50 equal to 0.57 mg/kg) is
      about 6 times more potent than methohexital (ED50 equal to 3.51 mg/kg) and 25
      times more potent than propanidid and thiopental (ED50's equal to 13.4 mg/kg).
      The safety margin (LD50/ED50) in these rats is 26.0 for etomidate, 9.5 for
      methohexital, 6.7 for propanidid and 4.6 for thiopental. Potency and toxicity of 
      etomidate slightly increase with increasing injection rates without affecting the
      safety margin. The duration of hypnosis with etomidate is dose-dependent and the 
      safety margin will therefore be widened when sleep of short duration is aimed at.
      Recovery after etomidate is very rapid. With lower body weights, higher doses in 
      mg/kg are required for inducing hypnosis of comparable duration. No systematic
      differences were found after etomidate injection in incidence and duration of
      hypnosis nor in mortality between animals of different sex. ECG, blood pressure, 
      haematological and biochemical analysis, urinalysis and histopathology did not
      reveal any drug-related adverse effect after daily injection of etomidate for 3
      weeks in rats (highest dose 5.0 mg/kg) and 2 weeks in dogs (highest dose 1.50
      mg/kg). No tolerance was observed after repeated administration. Etomidate is
      devoid of any teratogenic effect in rats (highest dose: 5.0 mg/kg daily from day 
      6 through day 15 of pregnancy), and in New Zealand white rabbits (highest dose:
      4.5 mg/kg daily from day 6 through day 18 of pregnancy). The hypnotic effects of 
      etomidate at very low dose levels in different laboratory animals are compared
      with the effects obtained in human subjects, in which successful induction of
      anaesthesia was obtained without producing any release of histamine and with only
      minimal effects on cardiovascular and respiratory functions.

TI  - Respiratory movements and rapid eye movement sleep in the foetal lamb.
PG  - 119-43
AB  - 1. In foetal lambs from 40 days gestation (0.27 of term) onwards delivered into a
      warm saline bath, apparently spontaneous breathing movements were present
      intermittently. They became deeper and more rapid with increasing age.2. In
      foetal lambs (from 0.66 of term) in which observations were made for many days
      after chronic implantation of tracheal, carotid and amniotic catheters, rapid
      irregular respiratory movements were present up to 40% of the time, and brief
      gasps also were seen.3. The presence of these movements was unrelated to the
      foetal carotid blood gas values over a wide range of spontaneous variation.4.
      These foetal breathing movements were accompanied by comparatively small
      alterations of pulmonary volume recorded from a tracheal flowmeter, insufficient 
      to clear the tracheal dead space. Occasionally a more prolonged expiration led to
      the outward flow of fluid.5. A description is given of sleep and wakefulness in
      foetal lambs from 0.78 of term.6. Rapid irregular breathing was associated with
      rapid eye movement sleep as seen in a warm saline bath or, in utero, as inferred 
      from records of eye movements and electrocortical activity.7. Respiratory
      movements were often associated with relatively large variations in foetal heart 
      rate, blood pressure and descending aortic blood flow.8. Rapid irregular foetal
      breathing was unaffected by section or blockade of the cervical vagi, but was
      abolished by general anaesthesia.9. It is concluded that respiratory movements
      are normally but intermittently present in the foetal lamb over the greater part 
      of gestation.

TI  - Leg cramps.
PG  - 204-6
AB  - Foot and leg cramps are among the most frequent complaints presented by patients 
      of both sexes, especially older persons. Similar cramping may occur in the thighs
      or in other skeletal muscles of the extremities and trunk. Foot and leg cramps
      usually occur after unusual exertion or during sleep. "Nocturnal leg cramps" may 
      be of sufficient intensity to prevent sleep. "Pregnancy cramps" are particularly 
      distressing. Effective treatment of foot and leg cramps requires an understanding
      of the etiology, pathophysiology and diagnostic techniques. Weight reduction and 
      improved diet are essential. Among the useful supplementary medications are
      calcium lactate or gluconate, vitamin-mineral supplements, sympathetic blocking
      agents, vasodilators, ataraxics, muscle relaxants, quinine, hydrochloride,
      antihistamines, and nonmercurial diuretics. Improved foot care and correction of 
      foot imbalance is usually required. Edema and venous insufficiency are improved
      by elastic support, by repeated foot elevation for massages, by manipulations and
      exercises and by the use of diuretics. There may be need for operations on the
      veins and for sclerotherapy. Patients with arterial insufficiency are often
      benefited by lumbar sympathetic blocks with long-acting anesthetics and
      intra-arterial injections with relaxants, vasodilators, thrombolytic enzymes and 
      anticoagulants. Sympathectomy, angiography and reconstructive arterial operations
      are indicated in only a small proportion of patients with foot and leg cramps.

OAB - Surviving Indian codices and inscriptions, reports written down by the Spanish,
      and continuity of practice from pre-conquest times are the sources of knowledge
      about obstetrics in Mexico prior to 1600. Antenatal care included avoidance of
      exposure to heat, no sleep during the day, and plenty of nourishment, although
      certain dietary precautions were recommended. Moderate intercourse during the
      first trimester was permitted but prohibited near the time of parturition. In
      general, midwives counseled the prospective mother to eat well, to rest
      physically and mentally, and to engage very moderately in manual labor. Massage
      was given at regular intervals, and vapor baths were taken. Juices of medicinal
      plants were administered during labor both to expedite it and to relieve pain.
      Women assumed a squatting position during labor, which was also assisted by
      abdominal massage and the manual dilation of the vulva. If parturition was
      prolonged, pressure was applied by the midwife who used her feet for this
      purpose. The child was bathed immediately after birth. Lactation was prolonged
      among the Mexicans.
