N2  - This review includes six recent and influential papers that have appeared in the three leading psychiatry journals from the Arab region. The first paper examined the role of personality profile in the motivation to quit smoking and concluded that there is a positive correlation between Novelty seeking (NS), Persistence (P), Cooperativeness (C) and motivation to quit smoking. The second study discussed the prevalence of abuse history in patients with schizophrenia whether physical or sexual, and its impact on their condition and function. The third paper reported that patients with substance abuse problem show more risky sexual behaviors than normal controls. The fourth study high-lighted the similarities regarding complaints about sleep and polysomnographic changes in depression patients and somatoform disorder patients. The fifth paper, investigated the prenatal and perinatal risk factors in autistic disorders. The sixth and final article concluded that poor levels of maternal fetal attachment during the course of pregnancy should be managed in order to optimize fetal and maternal health. Overall, the papers describe a wide spectrum of research initiatives in the Arab world that are likely to have implications for global mental health.

N2  - Comments on an article by M. V. Smith et al. (see record 2013-00500-005). Smith et al. described the neurobehavioral effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitors during the last trimester of pregnancy on neonates. As part of their study, Actiwatch® and the Actiware-Sleep software were used to make activity assessments. These data were used to judge sleep, wake, and the number of wakes during the monitoring period within one hour. As a preliminary setting of actigraphy, Actiwatch® requires the cut-off value of sensitivity for sleep/wake judgment. As expected, the low and high sensitivity settings yield different results on sleep/ wake judgment. Low sensitivity setting requires a greater number of movements for wake judgment than medium sensitivity setting, and high sensitivity setting requires a smaller number of movements for wake judgment than medium sensitivity setting. Unfortunately, there is no description on the cut-off point in the papers presented by Smith et al. and they selected the medium level of cut-off value as an initial setting. There is no definite evidence to determine the best sensitivity threshold of actigraphy for infants. As the number of cases is extremely limited in their study, the author recommend themto conduct further study with the consideration of cut-off value of sensitivity for actigraphy.

N2  - Provides a brief overview of a study which examined the effectiveness of music therapy for preterm neonates. For a while the literature on music therapy for preterm infants was more feel-good than science with relatively few studies of poor quality. The study was a multicentre randomized trial in which 272 infants of 32 weeks gestation served as their own controls examined changes in heart rate, sucking behavior and sleep when infants were played parent preferred song of kin culturally significant lullabies, breathing sounds, heartbeat rhythms or left in peace. Infants’ heart rates were significantly lower over time with all three interventions compared with controls. All interventions but particularly ocean disc showed an increase in positive sleep patterns. Sucking behavior improved with gato box. Oxygen saturation improved with lullaby, but more with Twinkle than with song of kin. Parental stress decreased when any music was played. This study gives some evidence that music helps preterm infants and their parents and is unique in the type of music studied. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The current chapter presents the differences in characteristics of two infants named Bella and Minnie. These two infants are very different but they were both caught up in marital conflict. As Daws pointed out, "When parents have an estranged relationship, the baby's experience will not only be pf a mother being in difficulties with being emotionally available to him, but he will also sense that his parents are not performing this for each other." Bella had good, self-regulation and was a settled toddler who slept well at night. After a violent exchange between her parents there was a change in Bella's sleeping pattern and her behavior. She was probably angry with her parents and frightened to go to sleep at night. Her mother brought her to see me in the hope of gaining some understanding of Bella's distress. In contrast, Minnie's distress began from birth, or possibly even earlier, in the pregnancy. Minnie was a "much wanted" baby whose mother had gone to great lengths to conceive her despite waiting until she was in her forties to plan a baby, which was a clue to her ambivalence about a having a child. Through capturing my gaze and looking from me to her mother, Minnie seemed to be entreating me to help her and her mother, and to link us. Gradually Muinie warmed up and as her mother was able to see her experience, and Minnie's depression, although it took many months, lifted.

N2  - Objective: Sleep deficiency is an emerging concept denoting a deficit in the quantity or quality of sleep. This may be particularly salient for pregnant women since they report considerable sleep complaints. Sleep deficiency is linked with morbidity, including degradations in psychosocial functioning, (e.g., depression and stress), which are recognized risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. We sought to describe the frequency of sleep deficiency across early gestation (10–20 weeks) and whether sleep deficiency is associated with reports of more depressive symptoms and stress. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 160) with no self-reported sleep or psychological disorder provided sleep data collected via diary and actigraphy during early pregnancy: 10–12, 14–16, and 18–20 weeks’ gestation. Sleep deficiency was defined as short sleep duration, insufficient sleep, or insomnia. Symptoms of depression and stress were collected at the same three time points. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the data. Results: Approximately 28%–38% met criteria for sleep deficiency for at least one time point in early gestation. Women who were sleep deficient across all time points reported more perceived stress than those who were not sleep deficient (p p = 0.02). Discussion: Sleep deficiency is a useful concept to describe sleep recognized to be disturbed in pregnancy. Women with persistent sleep deficiency appear to be at greater risk for impairments in psychosocial functioning during early gestation. These associations are important since psychosocial functioning is a recognized correlate of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Sleep deficiency may be another important risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This editorial discusses the involvement of grey matter and emotional intelligence in regulating sleep balance. The authors of one of the article reports that sleep credit correlated positively with grey matter volume in medial prefrontal cortex which, in turn, correlated positively with measures of emotional intelligence and mental health. Another article reports the prevalence of insomnia as assessed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, DSM-IV, DSM-V or quantitative criteria for insomnia of 23.8, 18.5 and 13.6%, respectively. In many of the articles, estimates of sleep duration, sleep deficits and credits were based on self-report. How well self-reported sleep duration correlates with sleep duration as measured by the sleep scientist, using actigraphy or polysomnography, has been investigated previously in healthy volunteers and insomnia patients. With regard to narcolepsy in Europe and pregnancy, there are two articles featured in this issue of Journal of Sleep Research. The first article provides a comprehensive assessment of clinical, sleep and genetic characteristics of 1099 patients in the retrospective database of the European Narcolepsy Network Maurovich and the second article reports on some aspects of narcolepsy in relation to pregnancy.

N2  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 23(2) of Journal of Sleep Research (see record 2014-09856-016). In the original article, there were two errors in the affiliations. The corrections are present in the erratum.] In a retrospective cohort study undertaken in 12 European countries, 249 female narcoleptic patients with cataplexy (n = 216) and without cataplexy (n = 33) completed a self‐administrated questionnaire regarding pregnancy and childbirth. The cohort was divided further into patients whose symptoms of narcolepsy started before or during pregnancy (308 pregnancies) and those in whom the first symptoms of narcolepsy appeared after delivery (106 pregnancies). Patients with narcolepsy during pregnancy were older during their first pregnancy (P (P P P < 0.05). The mean birth weight and gestational age of neonates were within the normal range and did not differ across groups. Neonatal care was affected adversely by symptoms of narcolepsy in 60.1% of those with narcolepsy during pregnancy. This study reports more obstetric complications in patients with narcolepsy–cataplexy during pregnancy; however, these were not severe. This group also had a higher BMI and higher incidence of impaired glucose metabolism during pregnancy. Caesarian section was conducted more frequently in narcolepsy–cataplexy patients, despite cataplexy being a rare event during delivery. Furthermore, symptoms of narcolepsy may render care of the infant more difficult. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: The aim of this cohort study was to prospectively assess frequency, characteristics, and determinants of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy and its impact on sleep. Methods: Pregnant women were prospectively studied in each trimester and 8 weeks postpartum. Assessments included interview about RLS symptoms and sleep disturbances; standardized sleep-wake questionnaires including the International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale (IRLSS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI); actigraphic recording of periodic limb movements (PLM); and blood tests including levels of hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen. Results: RLS was diagnosed in 58 of 501 women (12%). Positive family history was found in 37% of women with RLS; 59% reported onset of RLS symptoms before the 20th week; 45% had an IRLSS > 20 and 100% had a PSQI > 5. Hemoglobin levels < 11 g/dL were found in 20% of both affected and unaffected women in the third trimester. Women with and without RLS had similar hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen levels. IRLSS and PLM in sleep dropped by more than 50% postpartum in women with RLS. Conclusion: We found lower prevalence and earlier onset of symptoms compared to previous studies and confirmed significant improvement after delivery. RLS is clinically relevant due to severe impact on sleep quality. Genetic factors and smoking, but not ferritin, anemia, or estrogen levels, seem to play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS in pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Some studies report neurobehavioral symptoms in neonates exposed to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in utero. However, maternal psychiatric illness during the last trimester of pregnancy, as a confounding factor, has not always been assessed. Aims: In this prospective study we compared neurobehavioral complications among neonates who were born to euthymic women who either took or did not take an SRI during the last trimester of pregnancy. Study design: Exposed and unexposed infants were assessed for: 1) temperament as measured by the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS); 2) activity via Actiwatch electronic monitoring; 3) sleep state using trained observer ratings; and 4) perinatal complications through medical record review. T-tests, Fisher's exact tests, and analyses of covariance were used to assess the relationship between clinical and neurobehavioral factors and exposure status. Subjects: 67 infants (61 controls and 6 exposed to SRIs). Outcome measures: Neonatal Assessment Behavioral Scale, APGAR scores, infant sleep state (% sleep, % wakeful), startles and tremulousness, gestational age, birth weight, and head circumference. Results: Infants exposed to SRIs in the third trimester had poorer motor development, lower 5-minute APGAR scores, and shorter mean gestational age as compared to unexposed infants. Conclusion: Results of this study show differences in autonomic and gross motor activity between neonates who were or were not exposed to SRIs in utero after controlling for active maternal psychiatric illness. Future longitudinal work should compare longer term outcomes of exposed and unexposed infants of depressed mothers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Rational: Depression is prevalent among women of childbearing age and is frequently treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). As some SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Flx), can cross the placenta, it is possible that the neurodevelopment of the fetus may be affected, leading to altered behavior in adulthood. Objectives: In this study, we examined the effects of perinatal Flx exposure on the subsequent expression of circadian rhythms in adult mice. Methods: Dams were treated with 25 mg/kg/day Flx in their drinking water from embryonic day 15 to postnatal day 12. Circadian organization of wheel running rhythms and phase shifts to photic and non-photic stimuli were assessed in the offspring starting at 6 weeks of age. Results: We found that perinatal Flx exposure led to larger light-induced phase advances (1.19±0.51 vs. 0.55±0.25 h), smaller phase advances to the serotonin agonist 8-OH-DPAT during the mid-subjective day (0.44 ± 0.15 vs. 0.70 ± 0.17 h), and a shorter free-running period in constant darkness (23.47 ± 0.13 vs. 23.64 ± 0.13 h). Conclusions: These results suggest that perinatal exposure to SSRIs may have consequences for the functioning of the circadian system later in life.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological movement disorder that is often seen in multiple sclerosis patients. However, the association between RLS and multiple sclerosis (MS) is still unclear and RLS is not considered as one of the MS symptoms. This study was conducted to assess the frequency of RLS and its associated factors in patients with MS. This was a cross-sectional study conducted during January and April 2010. A total of 205 patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (164 females, 41 males, mean age 32.8 ± 8.9 years) were enrolled in the study and underwent a medical history interview and a neurological examination. The diagnosis of RLS was based on International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Criteria. 57 patients (27.8 %) met the RLS diagnostic criteria. In 90.1 % of the patients, the onset of RLS was simultaneous with or followed by MS onset. There was no significant difference between patients with and without RLS in respect of age, gender, disease duration, and MS pattern. There was an increased incidence of leg jerks before sleep in patients with RLS (P = 0.04). In patients suffering from RLS, there is greater complaint of insomnia (P = 0.03). Body mass index, history of anemia, excessive day-time somnolence, consuming caffeine containing beverages, pregnancy numbers, smoking, and alcohol consumption were not associated with the presence of RLS. This study revealed high prevalence of RLS in MS patients. Screening of RLS in these patients should be always considered in order to improve management of MS.

N2  - Objective: Using two cohorts born 29 years apart in Dunedin, New Zealand we aim to examine changes in risk factors and their associations with body mass index (BMI) at ages 3 and 7 years, and estimate their contribution to the secular changes in BMI at age 7 years. Methods: Birth weight and anthropometric measures at ages 3, 5 and 7 years were obtained for 974 participants in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (DMHDS), born in 1972–1973, and 241 in the Family Lifestyle, Activity, Movement and Eating Study (FLAME), born in 2001–2002. Information about maternal age, education and smoking in pregnancy, as well as breastfeeding, children's television time and time in bed, was obtained by questionnaire. Results: The increase in BMI over the 29-year period was 0.84 (95% CI 0.61, 1.06) kg m−2 at age 7. A 1-unit difference in the mother's BMI was associated with a 0.06 (0.03, 0.08) kg m−2 difference in offspring in both studies; the 3.4 (2.8, 4.0) kg m−2 increase in the mothers’ BMIs accounts for a change of 0.19 kg m−2 in the children's BMI. The much smaller generational increase in fathers’ BMI (0.7 kg m−2) correspondingly had a more limited effect on change in child BMI over time (0.06 kg m−2). Although smoking in pregnancy decreased by 15% (8, 21) its association with BMI increased from 0.20 (−0.01, 0.42) in the DMHDS cohort to 1.24 (0.76, 1.71) kg m−2 in the FLAME cohort, contributing 0.18 kg m−2 to the increase in children's BMI. Conclusions: Societal factors such as higher maternal BMI and smoking in pregnancy contribute most to the secular increase in BMI, with changes in behavioural factors, including sleep and television viewing, having little effect in this setting.

N2  - Background: Advances in genetic technologies have resulted in the diagnosis during pregnancy of increasing numbers of fetal abnormalities. A few published personal commentaries have indicated that health professionals’ interactions with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality can be emotionally and ethically challenging, highlighting the need for empirical research in this area. This study sought to explore whether working in the fetal medicine setting has an effect on health professionals and to ascertain any supports used to manage these effects. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 40 medical and allied health professionals working in fetal medicine settings in Melbourne, Australia. Qualitative analysis of the interview data was performed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants discussed at length the emotional impact of working with patients who were experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes. All participants reported that working in fetal medicine had an impact on their daily lives, and many spoke about dreaming about or losing sleep over patient outcomes. Participants described working in this setting as being particularly difficult when they were pregnant themselves. Most spoke about feeling largely unsupported in their work and felt that these effects resulted in burnout and staff turnover. Conclusions: This study explored several work force concerns in fetal medicine. Health professionals working with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality are vulnerable to the phenomena of compassion fatigue and burnout. The need for formal support and self-care management is suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This letter presents a study that aims to explore the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) for pregnant women in Asian countries compared to European and North American countries. The study conducted face to face interviews with a total of 200 pregnant women hospitalized prior to delivery using a set of standardized questions for RLS diagnosis, folic acid tablet and iron rich sustenance intake levels as well as sleep problems. Among the 200 Chinese participants, 17% of the pregnant women had RLS. The current results provides important evidence supporting the notion that the prevalence of RLS is indeed considerably lower for pregnant women in Asian countries compared to those of European and North American countries. In addition, it was found that a significantly lower mean hemoglobin level and greater percentage of iron-rich sustenance intake for women with RLS is supposedly linked with a greater percentage of anemia in pregnant women with RLS. This may lead to a phenomenon that sees a higher percentage of iron intake in pregnant women with RLS than in pregnant women without RLS. However, the limitation of this work was that the investigation was carried out in a single institute and was not over long period. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - We tested if the risk of suicidal ideation in individuals with PTSD symptoms was dependent on comorbid sleep disturbance. Our cross-sectional sample included 2465 participants with complete data from the 21 year follow-up of the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), a birth cohort study of young Australians. Using structural equation modelling with indirect pathways we found that 12 month PTSD symptoms did not directly predict suicidal ideation at 21 when adjusting for major depression symptoms, polyvictimization and gender. However, PTSD symptoms had an indirect effect on suicidal ideation via past-month sleep disturbance. Our results suggest that increased suicidal ideation in those with PTSD may result from the fact that PTSD sufferers often exhibit other comorbid psychiatric conditions which are themselves known to predict suicidal behaviours. Sleep disturbance may be targeted in those who experience PTSD to help prevent suicidal ideation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

A study of postpartum depression in a fast developing country: prevalence and related factors. Int J Psychiat Med 2012;43:325–337.] Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between maternal complications and postpartum depression (PPD) among postpartum women in Qatar by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as well as a structured questionnaire. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of PPD of 1379 postpartum women within 6 months of delivery attending the primary healthcare centers of the State of Qatar. Results: The prevalence of PPD was 17.6% in the studied mothers. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for PPD included various socio-demographic risk factors such as education, occupation, consanguinity and access to transportation. Amongst the maternal factors studied, history of unplanned pregnancy and infertility and other medical complications such as gestational diabetes, heart disease, threatened abortion and cesarean section were found to be risk factors for PPD. Amongst the postpartum women with maternal complications, items related to feeling scared and panicky and feeling sad and miserable were the most frequently reported symptoms of depression. These women were also more likely to be experiencing sleep difficulty (p = 0.029) compared to women without maternal complications. Conclusion: While socio-demographic risk factors are well studied in the PPD literature, there is much less information on the impact of maternal complications on the psychological status of postpartum women. Postpartum women, especially those with maternal complications, need close screening and have quick access to mental healthcare within integrated reproductive health services.

N2  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are currently diagnosed in the presence of impairments in social interaction and communication, and a restricted range of activities and interests. However, there is considerable variability in the behaviors of different individuals with an ASD diagnosis. The heterogeneity spans the entire range of IQ and language abilities, as well as other behavioral, communicative, and social functions. While any psychiatric condition is likely to incorporate a degree of heterogeneity, the variability in the nature and severity of behaviors observed in ASD is thought to exceed that of other disorders. The current paper aims to provide a model for future research into ASD subgroups. In doing so, we examined whether two proposed risk factors—low birth weight (LBW), and in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)—are associated with greater behavioral homogeneity. Using data from the Western Australian Autism Biological Registry, this study found that LBW and maternal SSRI use during pregnancy were associated with greater sleep disturbances and a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with ASD, respectively. The findings from this “proof of principle” paper provide support for this “bottom-up” approach as a feasible method for creating homogenous groups.

N2  - Background: Poor sleep, common during pregnancy, is associated with negative health risks. The study aimed to identify predictors of clinically significant insomnia among pregnant Latinas. Methods: A total of 1289 pregnant Latinas recruited from obstetric clinics completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISl) and questions about demographics and sleep. Results: Clinically significant insomnia (ISl ≥ 10) was present among 17% of participants. Significant correlates of clinically significant insomnia were higher scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) after removing the sleep item (47% of women with EPDS ≥ 9 and 9% with EPDS < 9), completing measures in English (rather than Spanish: 26% versus 13%), and income but not pregnancy week, age, highest education level, or marital status. The highest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (59%) was experienced by women with EPDS ≥ 9 who completed measures in English. The lowest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (6.2%) was experienced by women with EPDS < 9 who completed measures in Spanish. Conclusions: In this sample of low-income, mostly Spanish-speaking pregnant Latinas, rates of clinically significant insomnia appear to be higher than rates among nonpregnant Latinas. Rates of clinically significant insomnia are particularly high among Latinas with elevated depressive symptom severity, a known risk for insomnia. Acculturation, as indicated by completing measures in English, may be another risk specific to Latinas, possibly owing to loss of some ethnicity-specific protective factors (e.g., social support, strong family ties, and group identity). It will be important to directly test this explanation in future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Despite warnings about the dangers of drinking during pregnancy, little progress has been made in reducing alcohol drinking among women of childbearing age. Even after the recognition of pregnancy, 15% of women continue to drink, 3% of which admit to binge drinking. Because we cannot stop women from drinking during pregnancy, and many children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are adopted, there is a significant need to develop postnatal interventions that can improve the long-term outcome of children adversely affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This thesis aims to evaluate one promising new treatment in the rehabilitation or rescue of specific learning deficits long after the damage has occurred. The treatment evaluated herein (40µg D-NAP + 40µg D-SAL) has long been used in the prevention of the detrimental effects of long-term and binge-like alcohol exposures in rodent models of fetal alcohol syndrome and FASD. Until recently this peptide treatment had only been shown to be effective in preventing some of the consequences of alcohol exposure when administered concurrently with the prenatal alcohol exposure. A recent report by Incerti and colleagues (2010c), however, reported that these peptides could completely reverse a profound spatial learning deficit induced by one episode of a heavy binge-like alcohol exposure (5.9g.kg in a single intraperitoneal injection) on gestational day 8 (G8) in C57BL/6 mice. In that report, the peptide treatment was administered starting in late adolescence, beginning three days prior to and throughout water maze training, and the profound deficits in their alcohol-placebo group were completely eliminated in the alcohol-peptide group. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for FASD. An effective treatment for the cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions suffered by the 1% of people born today could potentially improve the lives of millions of children and adults. The first aim of this thesis was to determine whether the peptide treatment could reverse the significant spatial learning deficits we have demonstrated in adult C57BL/6 mice given high-dose binge-like alcohol exposure (2.5 g/kg in each of two intraperitoneal injections separated by two hours) on postnatal day (P)7. When administered three days prior to and throughout water maze testing (P67-76), the peptide treatment had no effect on spatial learning. The second aim sought to determine whether the same peptide treatment could reverse water maze spatial learning deficits in G8 binge-like exposure models, as reported by Incerti et al. (2010c). For this analysis, the first study used a different binge-like alcohol exposure model that is more commonly used than that employed by the Incerti et al. (2010c) study, namely administration of 2.8g/kg in each of two intraperitoneal injections separated by four hours (Sulik et al., 1981). This model has been shown to produce high peak blood alcohol concentrations and neuroanatomical aberrations in the hippocampal formation and septal regions (Parnell et al., 2009), which have been implicated in learning and memory. Surprisingly, this G8 binge-like alcohol exposure failed to produce a spatial learning deficit, undermining the usefulness of this model in evaluating the peptide effects. In direct contrast to the outcomes of Incerti et al. (2010c), the G8 Webster alcohol exposure was also unable to produce any deficits in acquisition of spatial learning in the Morris water maze. Surprisingly, neither of the heavy binge-like alcohol exposures on G8 were able to produce spatial learning deficits in the Morris water maze. The binge-like alcohol exposure on P7 did yield the expected spatial learning deficit, but the peptide treatment was unsuccessful in recovering water maze learning. These findings fail to support oral administration of 40µg D-NAP and 40 µg D-SAL as a potential therapy for postnatal alcohol-induced spatial learning deficits in adult mice.

N2  - Epilepsy affects approximately 1% of children under the age of 15, making it a very common neurological disorder in the pediatric population (Russ et al., 2012 [1]). In addition, ~0.4–0.8% of all pregnant women have some form of epilepsy (Hauser et al., 1996a,b; Borthen et al., 2009; Krishnamurthy, 2012 [2–5]). Despite the potential deleterious effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on the developing brain, their use is still required for seizure control in pregnant women (Krishnamurthy, 2012 [5]), and they represent the standard approach for treating children with epilepsy (Chu-Shore and Thiele, 2010; Quach et al., 2010; Verrotti et al., 2011 [6–8]). Even when AEDs are effective, there are potential side effects, including cognitive and affective changes or altered sleep and appetite. The consequences of AED exposure in development have been studied extensively (Canger et al., 1999; Modi et al., 2011a,b; Oguni, 2011 [9–12]). Despite intensive study, there is still debate about the long-term consequences of early life AED exposure. Here, we consider the evidence to date that AED exposure, either prenatally or in early postnatal life, has significant adverse effects on the developing brain and incorporate studies of laboratory animals as well as those of patients. We also note the areas of research where greater clarity seems critical in order to make significant advances. A greater understanding of the impact of AEDs on somatic, cognitive and behavioral development has substantial value because it has the potential to inform clinical practice and guide studies aimed at understanding the genetic and molecular bases of comorbid pathologies associated with common treatment regimens. Understanding these effects has the potential to lead to AEDs with fewer side effects. Such advances would expand treatment options, diminish the risk associated with AED exposure in susceptible populations, and improve the quality of life and health outcomes of children with epilepsy and children born to women who took AEDs during pregnancy.

N2  - Agomelatine is a novel antidepressant acting as an MT₁/MT₂ melatonin receptor agonist/5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonist. Because of its peculiar pharmacological profile, this drug caters the potential to correct the abnormalities of circadian rhythms associated with mood disorders, including abnormalities of the sleep/wake cycle. Here, we examined the effect of chronic agomelatine treatment on sleep architecture and circadian rhythms of motor activity using the rat model of prenatal restraint stress (PRS) as a putative 'aetiological' model of depression. PRS was delivered to the mothers during the last 10 d of pregnancy. The adult progeny ('PRS rats') showed a reduced duration of slow wave sleep, an increased duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, an increased number of REM sleep events and an increase in motor activity before the beginning of the dark phase of the light/dark cycle. In addition, adult PRS rats showed an increased expression of the transcript of the primary response gene, c-Fos, in the hippocampus just prior to the beginning of the dark phase. All these changes were reversed by a chronic oral treatment with agomelatine (2000 ppm in the diet). The effect of agomelatine on sleep was largely attenuated by treatment with the MT₁/MT₂ melatonin receptor antagonist, S22153, which caused PRS-like sleep disturbances on its own. These data provide the first evidence that agomelatine corrects sleep architecture and restores circadian homeostasis in a preclinical model of depression and supports the value of agomelatine as a novel antidepressant that resynchronizes circadian rhythms under pathological conditions.

N2  - Women are at increased risk of developing mood disorders during the postpartum period, and poor postpartum sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for the development of depression. This longitudinal study investigated the relationship between sleep variables and postpartum depression symptoms using wrist actigraphy and self-report surveys. Twenty-five healthy primiparous women were recruited from their outpatient obstetricians’ offices from July 2009 through March 2010. Subjects wore wrist actigraphs for 1 week during the third trimester of pregnancy and again during the 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th weeks postpartum while completing sleep logs and sleep surveys. Subjective assessments of mood were collected at the end of each actigraph week. Subjective sleep assessments were strongly predictive of depression severity scores as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) across all weeks (p < 0.001). Actigraphic measures of sleep maintenance, such as sleep fragmentation, sleep efficiency, and wake time after sleep onset, were also significantly correlated with EPDS scores postpartum. However, there was no relationship between nocturnal sleep duration and EPDS scores. This study provides additional evidence that poor sleep maintenance as measured by wrist actigraphy, rather than lesser amounts of sleep, is associated with EPDS scores during the postpartum period and that subjective assessments of sleep may be more accurate predictors of postpartum depression symptoms than wrist actigraphy. It also supports the hypothesis that disrupted sleep may contribute to the development and extent of postpartum depression symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Perinatal changes in maternal sleep patterns may modify circadian phase. Our objectives were to (a) measure changes in circadian phase and phase angle between salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and sleep onset across the perinatal period; and (b) prospectively examine associations between circadian measures and depressed mood in women with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Twelve women (age ± SD = 26.9 ± 5 years) who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) were studied from third trimester of pregnancy through postpartum week 6. Participants completed sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs and light sensors, and had mood assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) during 3 separate weeks of the perinatal period; they gave saliva samples at 33 weeks gestation and 6 weeks postpartum to determine DLMO phase. Results: Nine women had DLMO phase shifts ≥30 min. On average ± SD, new mothers phase delayed 42 ± 80min (range = 163 min phase delay to 144 min phase advance). The time interval between average actigraphic sleep onset and DLMO was shorter at 6 weeks postpartum compared to 3rd trimester in 9 of 12 women, indicating that most new mothers were going to bed closer to the onset of endogenous melatonin secretion. Circadian measures were associated with depressed mood at postpartum weeks 2 and 6. Limitations: These data are preliminary findings from a small sample and require replication. Conclusions: We observed individual differences in magnitude and direction of circadian phase shifts and their timing relative to sleep across the perinatal period. These measures were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms. These preliminary data indicate that changes in perinatal circadian rhythms may contribute to the development of postpartum mood disorders.

N2  - Mood disorders are a major public health problem and are associated with considerable burden of disease, suicides, physical comorbidities, high economic costs, and poor quality of life. Approximately 30%–40% of patients with major depression have only a partial response to available pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been used either alone or in combination with conventional therapies in patients with mood disorders. This review of the literature examines evidence-based data on the use of CAM in mood disorders. A search of the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Quertile databases using keywords was conducted, and relevant articles published in the English language in the peer-reviewed journals over the past two decades were retrieved. Evidence-based data suggest that light therapy, St John’s wort, Rhodiola rosea, omega-3 fatty acids, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness therapies, exercise, sleep deprivation, and S-adenosylmethionine are effective in the treatment of mood disorders. Clinical trials of vitamin B complex, vitamin D, and methylfolate found that, while these were useful in physical illness, results were equivocal in patients with mood disorders. Studies support the adjunctive role of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid in unipolar and bipolar depression, although manic symptoms are not affected and higher doses are required in patients with resistant bipolar depression and rapid cycling. Omega-3 fatty acids are useful in pregnant women with major depression, and have no adverse effects on the fetus. Choline, inositol, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, and N-acetylcysteine are effective adjuncts in bipolar patients. Dehydroepiandrosterone is effective both in bipolar depression and depression in the setting of comorbid physical disease, although doses should be titrated to avoid adverse effects. Ayurvedic and homeopathic therapies have the potential to improve symptoms of depression, although larger controlled trials are needed. Mind-body-spirit and integrative medicine approaches can be used effectively in mild to moderate depression and in treatment-resistant depression. Currently, although CAM therapies are not the primary treatment of mood disorders, level 1 evidence could emerge in the future showing that such treatments are effective.

N2  - We prospectively examined the associations of nighttime and daytime sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy with labor duration and risk of cesarean deliveries in a convenience sample of 120 nulliparous women who completed sleep‐related questionnaires and wore wrist actigraphs for up to 7 days. Nap duration and 24‐hour sleep duration were inversely associated with labor duration in women with vaginal delivery. Neither actigraphy‐derived nor self‐reported sleep variables were associated with type of delivery (e.g., vaginal, cesarean). Results showed a beneficial effect of sleep on labor duration and suggest that studies of sleep duration effects on labor and pregnancy outcomes require a consideration of the amount of both daytime and nighttime sleep.

N2  - Objective: Disturbed sleep and depression are potential risk factors for pregnancy complications. Both conditions are known to dysregulate biological pathways responsible for maintaining homeostatic balance and pregnancy health. Depression during pregnancy is associated with poor sleep. Thus, we explored whether disturbed sleep was associated with inflammatory cytokines and risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as whether depression augmented the sleep-cytokine relationship, thereby additively contributing to risk for adverse outcomes. Methods: Interview-assessed sleep and plasma cytokine concentrations were evaluated in a cohort of depressed and nondepressed pregnant women (n = 168) at 20 and 30 weeks’ gestation. Outcomes evaluated included preterm birth, birth weight, and peripartum events. Results: Among depressed women, short sleep duration (p = .001), poor sleep efficiency (p = .006), and daytime naps were associated with higher tumor necrosis factor > (A = 0.105, p = .024). Aspects of poor sleep were associated with having a lower weight baby (p values p = .032). Trends for IL-6 and higher birth weight (β = 105.2, p = .085), interferon-F and lower birth weight (β = -19.92, p p < .083) were observed. Conclusions: Although speculative, disturbed sleep may disrupt normal immune processes and contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Exploratory analyses indicate that depression modifies these relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a common form of epilepsy and a fairly lifelong disorder that may significantly lower a patient's expectations and potential for a full life. Luckily, it is also a highly treatable disorder, and up to 85% of patients with JME will enjoy satisfactory seizure control. Among anticonvulsants, valproate still stands out as the most efficacious drug, but may be poorly tolerated by some, and is considered unsafe for the fetuses of pregnant women. Alternatives have emerged in recent years, especially levetiracetam, but also topiramate, zonisamide or lamotrigine. In some cases, combination therapy may be useful or even required. One should not forget the potential aggravation induced not only by some commonly used anticonvulsants, especially carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, but also, in some patients, by lamotrigine. In special settings, older drugs like benzodiazepines and barbiturates may be useful. But the management of JME should also include intervention in lifestyle, with strict avoidance of sleep deprivation and the management of copathologies, including the cognitive and psychiatric problems that are often encountered. With adequate management, there will only remain a small proportion of patients with uncontrolled epilepsy and all of its related problems. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is a condition in which the clinician has a fair chance of significantly helping the patient with medication and counseling.

N2  - Purpose: This study examined the patterns and psychosocial predictors of sleep quality in Taiwanese pregnant women. Study Design and Methods: A cross-sectional, correlational study design was used. A convenience sample of 400 pregnant women from two urban hospitals in Taiwan participated in this study. Data were collected using six self-report measures: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Attitude to Body Image Scale, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List. Results: Our findings revealed that the prevalence of pregnancy-associated sleep disturbance (PSQI score > 5) was 65.5%, The mean score of the global PSQI was 7.25 ± 3.43, indicating that participant pregnant women in general reported mild sleep disturbance. Trend analyses of PSQI score indicated linear trend, with a gradual decline in the sleep quality as the pregnancy progressed. Sleep latency, habitual sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep quality scores differed significantly by trimesters. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that the best subsets to predict sleep quality were prenatal depression, prepregnancy sleep quality, current body image, and week of gestation for Taiwanese pregnant women. Clinical Implications: These findings offer evidence that healthcare professionals should provide sleep counseling to pregnant women, and incorporate depression and body image into a supportive model of sleep-related prenatal care.

N2  - Socioeconomic status (SES) impacts on both structural and functional brain development in childhood, but how early its effects can be demonstrated is unknown. In this study we measured resting baseline EEG activity in the gamma frequency range in awake 6–9‐month‐olds from areas of East London with high socioeconomic deprivation. Between‐subject comparisons of infants from low‐ and high‐income families revealed significantly lower frontal gamma power in infants from low‐income homes. Similar power differences were found when comparing infants according to maternal occupation, with lower occupational status groups yielding lower power. Infant sleep, maternal education, length of gestation, and birth weight, as well as smoke exposure and bilingualism, did not explain these differences. Our results show that the effects of socioeconomic disparities on brain activity can already be detected in early infancy, potentially pointing to very early risk for language and attention difficulties. This is the first study to reveal region‐selective differences in functional brain development associated with early infancy in low‐income families.

N2  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common childbirth complication, which can have negative effects on both the newly delivered woman and her family. This condition is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated, while a biological diagnostic test is not yet available. Furthermore, postpartum thyroid dysfunction is common among new mothers, and some evidence point to an association between PPD and thyroid function disturbances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between serum levels of thyroid hormones at the time of delivery, and the later development of depressive symptoms, using data from a population based cohort of Swedish women. Blood samples were collected during delivery from 347 participating women, delivering at Uppsala University Hospital. The participating women filled in at least one of three structured questionnaires, containing the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), at five days, six weeks and six months postpartum. A cut-off of 12 or more was applied on the EPDS, to identify cases of self-reported PPD and controls. Using a binary logistic regression model (adjusting for previous psychiatric contact, smoking during pregnancy, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and sleep), having a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level over the clinical cut-off level of 4.0 mU/L was associated with increased risk for depressive symptoms at six months postpartum (OR 11.30, 95% CI 1.93-66.11). A ROC analysis revealed that the predictive variable (PV) had significant predictive ability for PPD at 6 months postpartum, given that the AUC was 0.764, and at a PV cut-off value of 6.33, the sensitivity and specificity were 76.2% and 69.4%, respectively. If these findings are replicated in future studies, they can have important clinical implications, since TSH determination is an inexpensive routine blood test, and its inclusion in a biological screening test for PPD involving other parameters would be tempting.

N2  - A growing body of evidence suggests that immune alterations, especially those related to inflammation, are associated with increased risk of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related brain alterations. Much of this work has focused on the prenatal period, because infections during pregnancy have been repeatedly (albeit inconsistently) linked to risk of schizophrenia. Given that most infections do not cross the placenta, cytokines associated with inflammation (proinflammatory cytokines) have been targeted as potential mediators of the damaging effects of infection on the fetal brain in prenatal studies. Moreover, additional evidence from both human and animal studies suggests links between increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, immune-related genes, and schizophrenia as well as brain alterations associated with the disorder. Additional support for the role of altered immune factors in the etiology of schizophrenia comes from neuroimaging studies, which have linked proinflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms with some of the structural and functional abnormalities repeatedly found in schizophrenia. These findings are reviewed and discussed with a life course perspective, examining the contribution of inflammation from the fetal period to disorder presentation. Unexplored areas and future directions, such as the interplay between inflammation, genes, and individual-level environmental factors (e.g., stress, sleep, and nutrition), are also discussed.

N2  - Little is known about modifiable lifestyle factors beyond quitting smoking that could prevent preterm delivery (PTD,8 h vs. 7–8 h). When sleep and exercise variables were modeled together along with pre-pregnancy BMI, only moderate exercise (OR = 0.91; 95 % CI 0.85–0.98) continued to be associated with reduced odds of PTD. The benefits of moderate exercise appeared strongest for women with BMI greater than 24 kg/m² (OR = 0.85; 95 % CI = 0.79–0.93) and weakened with decreasing BMI. No other interactions were found. Moderate exercise is associated with reduced PTD, particularly for women with BMI above the normal range. The results are of public health relevance given that these risk factors are potentially modifiable both preconceptionally and during pregnancy and rates of PTD are still high in the United States.

N2  - Background: Napping is highly prevalent in pregnant women, but the relation between nighttime sleep and daytime naps in pregnant women is poorly understood. Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the temporal association of nighttime sleep quality and quantity with subsequent daytime naps and the temporal association of daytime naps with sleep quality and quantity the following night in women during the third trimester of pregnancy in Taiwan. Methods: Sleep was assessed in 80 Taiwanese nulliparous women aged 31.70 years (SD = 4.58 years) using actigraphy and diaries for 7 consecutive days. Subjective sleep quality was examined using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Multiple linear regressions with generalized estimating equations were used to examine the temporal associations of nighttime sleep and daytime naps. Results: All women napped sometime during the study week, and mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score was 6.6, indicating poor sleep quality. Fewer weekly work hours and shorter sleep duration the preceding night were associated with longer nap duration the next day. More work hours, longer nap duration, and more intense fatigue were associated with shorter sleep duration the following night. Discussion: Naps during pregnancy might indicate insufficient nighttime sleep, and longer daytime naps could compromise subsequent nighttime sleep. Further research is needed to determine if short sleep duration and longer daytime naps are associated with negative pregnancy outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study investigated episodic and procedural memory retention in early and late pregnancy and whether memory retention was related to sleep disruption. Twenty-six women in the third trimester of pregnancy, 20 women in the first trimester of pregnancy, and 24 non-pregnant controls were administered a battery of verbal and visual episodic memory tasks and two procedural memory tasks before undergoing an overnight sleep study. Memory retention was assessed the following morning. Results indicated that as compared with controls, both pregnant groups had reduced retention in verbal episodic memory but were unimpaired on visual and procedural memory tasks. The pregnant women also demonstrated significant disruption of sleep patterns. Reduced verbal memory retention during pregnancy was not attributable to any measure of sleep; however, small correlations between some indices of sleep and memory do not allow full dismissal of the sleep-dependent memory consolidation hypothesis.

N2  - Knowledge translation has relied on research products that take years to disseminate, losing relevance for intended users. We used a mixed-methods approach to determine women’s preferences for research results and format, intention to share results, and potential benefits. We sampled healthy, pregnant women who completed survey data during their third trimesters and wanted access to results. Mothers preferred results about sleep, fears, and anxieties during later pregnancy to benefit from reassurance that their experiences were shared. Women mostly intended to share results with their social networks. Organizational contacts increased dissemination of the women’s preferred information to nonstudy participants.

N2  - We have investigated if biological rhythms, which affect many physiological and pathological events, influence the time of birth. Two hundred and sixty-three cases who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of active labor and who delivered vaginally were enrolled in the study. Information about the age, gravidity, parity, gestational age on admission, and time of onset of labor and birth was registered. A Morningness– Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) was administered for determining the patients’ chronotypes and dividing them into a morning- or evening-type group. While 20 (35%) of the morning-types delivered between 18:00 and 24:00 h, only 11 (19%) of them delivered between 06:00 and 12:00 h. From the evening types, 6 (33%) delivered between 18:00 and 24:00 h and 3 (17%) between 06:00 and 12:00 h. We conclude that there was no statistically significant difference between the chronotypes in terms of delivery time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study compared self-reported sleep latency (SL) and total sleep time (TST) to objective measures on polysomnography (PSG) during pregnancy. Thirty-three women in the third trimester (T3) of pregnancy, 16 women in the first trimester (T1) of pregnancy, and 15 non-pregnant women underwent overnight PSG, and shortly after awakening reported their perceived SL and TST. Results showed that, on average, the T3 group slightly overestimated their TSTs, whereas the T1 and non-pregnant groups underestimated TSTs when compared with objective measurement. All groups overestimated SL, and perceived SL was closest to the first epoch of 10 min of uninterrupted sleep or the first epoch of slow-wave sleep, rather than the first epoch of sleep (the current definition used for diagnostic sleep studies). The wide variation in discrepancies between estimation and PSG measurement for both TST and SL shows that self-reports made by both pregnant and non-pregnant women tend to be unreliable, which has important implications both clinically and for the many studies based on self-reported sleep patterns in pregnancy.

N2  - Serotonergic neurotoxicity following MDMA is well-established in laboratory animals, and neuroimaging studies have found lower serotonin transporter (SERT) binding in abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users. Serotonin is a modulator for many different psychobiological functions, and this review will summarize the evidence for equivalent functional deficits in recreational users. Declarative memory, prospective memory, and higher cognitive skills are often impaired. Neurocognitive deficits are associated with reduced SERT in the hippocampus, parietal cortex, and prefrontal cortex. EEG and ERP studies have shown localised reductions in brain activity during neurocognitive performance. Deficits in sleep, mood, vision, pain, psychomotor skill, tremor, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status, have also been demonstrated. The children of mothers who take Ecstasy/MDMA during pregnancy have developmental problems. These psychobiological deficits are wide-ranging, and occur in functions known to be modulated by serotonin. They are often related to lifetime dosage, with light users showing slight changes, and heavy users displaying more pronounced problems. In summary, abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users can show deficits in a wide range of biobehavioral functions with a serotonergic component. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Aim: To evaluate the impact of moderate noise on the sleep of very early preterm infants (VPI). Methods: Observational study of 26 VPI of 26–31 weeks’ gestation, with prospective measurements of sound pressure level and concomitant video records. Sound peaks were identified and classified according to their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above background noise. Prechtl’s arousal states during sound peaks were assessed by two observers blinded to the purpose of the study. Changes in sleep/arousal states following sound peaks were compared with spontaneous changes during randomly selected periods without sound peaks. Results: We identified 598 isolated sound peaks (5 ≤ SNR < 10 decibel slow response A (dBA), n = 518; 10 ≤ SNR < 15 dBA, n = 80) during sleep. Awakenings were observed during 33.8% (95% CI, 24–43.7%) of exposures to sound peaks of 5–10 dBA SNR and 39.7% (95% CI, 26–53.3%) of exposures to sound peaks of SNR 10–15 dBA, but only 11.7% (95% CI, 6.2–17.1%) of control periods. The proportions of awakenings following sound peaks were higher than the proportions of arousals during control periods (p < 0.005). Conclusions: Moderate acoustic changes can disrupt the sleep of VPI, and efficient sound abatement measures are needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Humans have an innate requirement for sleep that is intrinsically governed by circadian and endocrine systems. More recently, reduced sleep duration has gained significant attention for its possible contribution to metabolic dysfunction. Significant evidence suggests that reduced sleep duration may elevate the risk for impaired glucose functioning, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, to date, few studies have determined the implications of reduced sleep duration with regard to glucose control during pregnancy. With the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age, the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing. GDM results in elevated risk of maternal and fetal complications, as well as increased risk of type 2 diabetes postpartum. Infants born to women with GDM also carry a life-long risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The impact of reduced sleep on glucose management during pregnancy has not yet been fully assessed and a paucity of literature currently exits. Herein, we review the association between reduced sleep and impaired carbohydrate metabolism and propose how reduced sleep during pregnancy may result in further dysfunction of the carbohydrate axis. A particular focus will be given to sleep-disordered breathing, as well as GDM-complicated pregnancies. Putative mechanisms of action by which reduced sleep may adversely affect maternal and infant outcomes are also discussed. Finally, we will outline important research questions that need to be addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Gestational hypertension (GH) is a newly recognized risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events later in life. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is an established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events. Recent research has suggested that women with GH may have an increased rate of SDB during pregnancy, but it is not known if this higher rate of SDB persists into the postpartum state. Objective: To assess whether women with GH continue to have an increased rate of SDB compared to healthy pregnant women, after the physiologic changes of pregnancy resolve. Methods: We previously studied women with GH and uncomplicated pregnancies with sleep questionnaires and level 1 polysomnography. Participants were invited to participate in repeat testing 1-2 years postpartum. Respiratory disturbance index (RDI) differences were assessed. Results: Eighteen subjects (11 GH and 7 healthy) had complete follow-up data available for comparison with antepartum data. This group was representative of the initial antepartum cohort. Women with GH experienced a decrease in mean RDI from antepartum to postpartum (12.0 ± 12.3 vs 2.9 ± 2.9; P = 0.02). Healthy women did not experience the same change (2.8 ± 5.3 vs 2.1 ± 3.2; P = 0.81). Postpartum comparisons showed the mean RDI of women with GH had decreased to be similar to that of healthy women (P = 0.75). Conclusions: SDB in women with gestational hypertension improved in the postpartum state to levels indistinguishable from our healthy subjects. This suggests that the physiologic effects of pregnancy may have had a pathologic role in the development of antepartum SDB in women with GH.

N2  - Somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, appetite changes, and sleep disruption) are common to both pregnancy and depression. The goal of the present study was to examine the validity of somatic symptoms as indicators of depression during pregnancy. The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) was administered to a cross-sectional sample of 255 pregnant women as well as 820 women from five community-based samples, who served as a control group. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the fit of a single-factor model of depression in pregnant and community samples. Multigroup CFA was used to test the invariance of the factor loadings of eight depression-related symptom scales. The fit for a one-factor model was adequate for both the pregnant and community samples. All eight IDAS scales were valuable indicators of depression in the community group; however, Appetite Loss and Appetite Gain were poor indicators of depression among the pregnant women. The factor loadings for Lassitude and Appetite Gain were significantly weaker amongst the pregnant women than community women. The magnitude of the factor loadings for Insomnia and Well Being were significantly greater for the pregnant group. With the exception of appetite disturbance, somatic symptoms, though a common occurrence during pregnancy, are valid indicators of depression during pregnancy. When assessing for prenatal depression, somatic symptoms should not necessarily be dismissed as normative pregnancy experiences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is reported commonly during pregnancy and is associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, but the majority of these data are based upon self-report measures not validated for pregnancy. This study examined the predictive value of screening questionnaires for SDB administered at two time-points in pregnancy, and attempted to develop an ‘optimized predictive model’ for detecting SDB in pregnancy. A total of 380 women were recruited from an antenatal clinic in the second trimester of pregnancy. All participants completed the Berlin Questionnaire and the Multivariable Apnea Risk Index (MAP Index) at recruitment, with a subset of 43 women repeating the questionnaires at the time of polysomnography at 37 weeks’ gestation. Fifteen of 43 (35%) women were confirmed to have a respiratory disturbance index (RDI) > 5 h−1. Prediction of an RDI > 5 h−1 was most accurate during the second trimester for both the Berlin Questionnaire (sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.50, positive predictive value 0.50 and negative predictive value 0.93), and the MAP Index [area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.768]. A stepwise selection model identified snoring volume, a body mass index (BMI) ≥32 kg m−2 and tiredness upon awakening as the strongest independent predictors of SDB during pregnancy; this model had an area under the ROC curve of 0.952. We conclude that existing clinical prediction models for SDB perform inadequately as a screening tool in pregnancy. The development of a highly predictive model from our data shows promise for a quick and easy screening tool to be validated for future use in pregnancy.

N2  - Aims: This paper aimed to review how scientific knowledge about the human psychobiology of MDMA has developed over time. Methods: In this paper, the empirical findings from earlier and later studies will be reviewed. Results: When MDMA was a ‘novel psychoactive substance’, it was not seen as a drug of abuse, as it displayed loss of efficacy. However, recreational users display a unique pattern of increasing doses, deteriorating cost–benefit ratios, and voluntary cessation. MDMA increases body temperature and thermal stress, with cortisol levels increased by 800% in dance clubbers. It can be extremely euphoric, although negative moods are also intensified. MDMA causes apoptosis (programmed cell death) and has been investigated for cancer therapy because of its anti-lymphoma properties. Recreational users show deficits in retrospective memory, prospective memory, higher cognition, problem solving, and social intelligence. Basic cognitive skills remain intact. Neuroimaging studies show reduced serotonin transporter levels across the cerebral cortex, which are associated with neurocognitive impairments. Deficits also occur in sleep architecture, sleep apnoea, complex vision, pain, neurohormones, and psychiatric status. Ecstasy/MDMA use during pregnancy leads to psychomotor impairments in the children. Conclusions: The damaging effects of Ecstasy/MDMA are far more widespread than was realized a few years ago, with new neuropsychobiological deficits still emerging.

N2  - There is evidence for the reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillation and reproduction, and disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with impaired menstrual functions and reduced fertility in women. However, only little information is available on the relationship between reproduction and chronotype. The aim of the present study is to better assess this relationship. The participants (aged 25 to 74 yrs) were selected randomly from the Finnish Population Information System. The data from 2672 female participants of the National FINRISK Survey 2007 were analyzed to test the associations between chronotype (morning, intermediate, or evening) and reproductive features. Of the participants, 139 (5.6%) were evening, 1217 (48.7%) intermediate, and 1145 (45.8%) morning chronotypes. Among the participants aged 25 to 54 yrs, the duration of menstrual cycle was longer among evening chronotypes (28.8 4.4 d) than among morning (27.7 ± 2.6 d; p  0.01) and intermediate (27.8 ± 3.3 d; p = 0.05) chronotypes. Significant correlations were found between the higher morningness-eveningness scores (the more of morning chronotype) and the shorter durations of menstrual bleeding, both in the whole sample (p  0.001) and after limiting the analyses to women younger than 55 yrs (p  0.05). In multivariable analyses on the whole sample, as compared with morning chronotypes, intermediate chronotypes had a significantly longer duration of menstrual bleeding (B = 0.160, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.044 to 0.276; p p  0.01). Our findings suggest that chronotype is related to the reproductive function in women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a substantial risk of subsequently developing type 2 diabetes. This risk may be mitigated by engaging in healthy eating, physical activity, and weight loss when indicated. Since postpartum depressive symptoms may impair a woman’s ability to engage in lifestyle changes, we sought to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms in the early postpartum period among women with recent GDM. The participants are part of the baseline cohort of the TEAM GDM (Taking Early Action for Mothers with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) study, a one-year randomized trial of a lifestyle intervention program for women with a recent history of GDM, conducted in Boston, Massachusetts between June 2010 and September 2012. We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 4–15 weeks postpartum to women whose most recent pregnancy was complicated by GDM (confirmed by laboratory data or medical record review). An EPDS score ≤ 9 indicated depressive symptoms. We measured height and thyroid stimulating hormone, and administered a questionnaire to collect demographic data and information about breastfeeding and sleep. We calculated body mass index (BMI) using self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and measured height. We reviewed medical records to obtain data about medical history, including history of depression, mode of delivery, and insulin use during pregnancy. We conducted bivariable analyses to identify correlates of postpartum depressive symptoms, and then modeled the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms using multivariable logistic regression. Our study included 71 women (mean age 33 years ± 5; 59 % White, 28 % African-American, 13 % Asian, with 21 % identifying as Hispanic; mean prepregnancy BMI 30 kg/m² ± 6). Thirty-four percent of the women scored ≤ 9 on the EPDS at the postpartum visit. In the best fit model, factors associated with depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum included cesarean delivery (aOR 4.32, 95 % CI 1.46, 13.99) and gestational weight gain (aOR 1.21 [1.02, 1.46], for each additional 5 lbs gained). Use of insulin during pregnancy, breastfeeding, personal history of depression, and lack of a partner were not retained in the model. Identifying factors associated with postpartum depression in women with GDM is important since depression may interfere with lifestyle change efforts in the postpartum period. In this study, cesarean delivery and greater gestational weight gain were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms among women with recent GDM (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01158131).

N2  - For many psychiatric illnesses, the onset of symptoms begins during the late teens to the early thirties. This is especially concerning in women as it coincides with the childbearing years. Pregnancy was once thought to be protective from psychiatric illness. However, as the recent explosion of literature addressing the safety of psychotropic agents in pregnancy illustrates, the puerperal period is not exempt from mental illness. The presence of mental illness in pregnancy is associated with poor compliance with prenatal care; increased tobacco, alcohol, and illicit substance use; inadequate maternal nutrition; poor mother-infant bonding; and disruption of the home environment. While the diagnostic criteria are the same as in nonpregnant patients, many symptoms common in mental illness, such as fatigue, low energy, and disrupted sleep, are also normal for pregnancy. Medication treatment is a controversial issue: in the case of the pregnant patient, there are at least two (or more!) patients, mother and unborn child, and many of the treatments available to address mental illness can potentially harm the fetus. This chapter will present the major mental health topics of concern in pregnant patients and offer guidelines in the management of these patients in the emergency setting.

N2  - Study Objective: This cohort study examined the impact of maternal snoring on key delivery outcomes such as mode of delivery, infant birth centile, and small-for-gestational age. Design: Cohort study. Setting: A large tertiary medical center. Patients or Participants: Pregnant women in their third trimester were recruited between March 2007 and December 2010. Measurements and Results: Women were screened for habitual snoring, as a known marker for sleep disordered breathing. Outcome data were obtained from medical records following delivery and birth centiles were calculated. Of 1,673 women, a total of 35% reported habitual snoring (26% with pregnancy-onset snoring and 9% with chronic snoring). After adjusting for confounders, chronic snoring was associated with small-for-gestational age (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.02-2.66, P = 0.041) and elective cesarean delivery (OR 2.25, 95%CI 1.22-4.18, P = 0.008). Pregnancy-onset snoring was associated with emergency cesarean delivery (OR 1.68, 95%CI 1.22-2.30, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Maternal snoring during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse delivery outcomes including cesarean delivery and small-for-gestational age. Screening pregnant women for symptoms of SDB may provide an early opportunity to identify women at risk of poor delivery outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Mental health is an important medical issue in perinatal care, and there is increasing evidence that insomnia during pregnancy is associated with postpartum depression (PPD). Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of insomnia treatment during the third trimester of pregnancy on PPD symptoms. Fifty-four pregnant women with insomnia were randomly assigned to trazodone, diphenhydramine, or placebo treatment. Sleep quality was measured by actigraphy at baseline, and after 2 and 6 weeks of treatment. In addition, depression was assessed 2 and 6 weeks after delivery. Trazodone and diphenhydramine improved sleep profile compared to placebo after 6 weeks of treatment. Further, depressive symptoms were reduced 2 and 6 weeks after delivery in trazodone and diphenhydramine groups compared to placebo. No differences in depressive symptoms were observed between the trazodone and diphenhydramine groups. These findings indicate that insomnia treatment with trazodone or diphenhydramine during the third trimester of pregnancy may prevent PPD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep disorders, prevalent in industrialized countries, are associated with adverse health outcomes such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is frequently overlooked by health care providers, yet recent studies suggest there is an association between sleep disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, elevated serum glucose, depression, prolonged labor, and cesarean birth. Growing evidence indicates that the recognition and management of prenatal sleep disorders may minimize adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve maternal and fetal well‐being. This focused review of prenatal sleep disturbance literature suggests there are 3 main sleep disorders of interest: breathing‐related sleep disorders (ie, habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnea), restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. These sleep disorders are common in pregnancy and have maternal and fetal consequences if left untreated. This article describes sleep disorders of pregnancy, elucidates their relationship with maternal and neonatal outcomes, and presents current evidence regarding diagnostic and management strategies.
