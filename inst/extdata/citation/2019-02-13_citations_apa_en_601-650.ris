N2  - Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with significant changes in sleep architecture and the subjective quality of sleep. These changes are caused by the many physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy (eg, altered hormone levels, increased urination at night, changes in body size) and post partum, especially with a newborn to tend. Although most women negotiate the disruption to their sleep very well, others may experience such severe disruption to sleep that it compromises their physical well-being and mental health. Physicians providing care for pregnant women must inquire about sleep patterns; if a woman is reporting significant difficulty coping with the disruption, a thorough history should be taken. Primary sleep disorders are common in pregnancy and further investigation and treatment may be warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Hyperprolactinaemia is the commonest endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and can lead to both short-term sexual dysfunction and galactorrhoea, and long-term loss of bone mineral density. Prolactin is secreted from the anterior pituitary gland under the influence of dopamine, which exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on prolactin secretion. Physiological regulators of prolactin secretion include many different types of 'stress' and sleep. Disruption of the normal control of prolactin secretion results in hyperprolactinaemia from pathological and pharmacological causes. The administration of antipsychotic medication is responsible for the high prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia in people with severe mental illness. Physiological hyperprolactinaemia, such as pregnancy and lactation, should be distinguished from pathological causes to prevent unnecessary investigation and treatment. The causes, consequences and management of hyperprolactinaemia are discussed in this article. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - During pregnancy several physical and hormonal alterations may affect normal sleep and the respiratory system and predispose pregnant women to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) or worsen pre-existing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). SDB has been associated with several complications of pregnancy affecting maternal and fetal health. Clinicians should evaluate more closely obese pregnant women and those who develop hypertension. Early recognition and treatment of SDB may improve the outcome of pregnancy but the indications for treatment of OSAS need to be investigated. The diagnosis of OSAS in pregnancy requires a high index of suspicion and prevention of suspected SDB should be incorporated in the management of pregnancy.

N2  - The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in late pregnancy is as high as 15%, a result of normal physiologic processes occurring during pregnancy, and its prevalence in pre-eclampsia is even higher. The cardiovascular risks associated with SDB have an even stronger association in pregnancy: with SDB in pregnancy there is an eightfold relative risk of developing systemic hypertension, primarily because the vascular inflammatory processes leading to endothelial dysfunction that occur in SDB are increased during pregnancy. The fetal effects of maternal cardiovascular compromise arising from SDB include growth restriction and impaired movement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Women seem to have a heightened risk for developing sleep disorders compared with men; women also show a greater risk for developing some psychiatric problems including mood and anxiety disorders. The modulatory effects of sex hormones on sleep-wake behaviors and mood may contribute to this compounded risk and to the emergence of symptoms throughout the female reproductive life cycle. This article focuses on the clinical evidence for sleep disorders in women. Particular attention is paid to the hormonal and mood interactions with sleep disorders (sleep initiation and sleep maintenance) in the context of menstrual cycle changes, pregnancy, and in the menopausal years. Lastly, management strategies for sleep disorders in women are critically discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that disturbances in levels of plasma melatonin differentiate pregnant and postpartum women with major depression from matched pregnant and postpartum healthy comparison women. Method: Participants were 25 pregnant women (10 with major depression, 15 healthy) and 24 postpartum women (13 with major depression, 11 healthy). Healthy comparison women were matched on the number of weeks pregnant or postpartum. Plasma melatonin levels for each subject were measured every 30 minutes, in dim light (<30 lux), from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m. The values of plasma melatonin levels were log-transformed, and calculations were determined for the following measures: baseline and synthesis onset and offset times, duration, peak concentration, and area under the curve. Groups were compared by analyses of covariance, with age, number of weeks pregnant or postpartum, breast-feeding status, and body mass index as covariates. Results: Morning melatonin levels from 2:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. were significantly lower in pregnant women with major depression relative to healthy pregnant women. However, these levels were significantly higher in postpartum women with major depression across time intervals relative to postpartum healthy women. Pregnant but not postpartum women with a personal or family history of depression, regardless of their current diagnosis, had significantly earlier melatonin synthesis and baseline offset times relative to women without a family history of depression. In pregnant healthy women but not pregnant women with major depression, melatonin levels increased during the course of pregnancy. This association was not found among postpartum women with major depression or postpartum healthy women. Conclusions: Plasma nocturnal melatonin concentrations, particularly during morning hours, were lower in depressed pregnant women but elevated in depressed postpartum women relative to matched healthy comparison women. In addition, melatonin timing measures were advanced in pregnant women with a personal or family history of depression. These findings implicate disturbances in the regulation of the melatonin generating system in pregnancy and postpartum depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - To identify the concordance in assessments of health and social care needs of pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness as assessed by patients themselves and their mental healthcare professionals. Thirty-five staff-patient pairs were recruited from inpatient and community services. Staff and patients completed the Camberwell Assessment of Need--Mothers Version. There were significant differences in the total number of needs (p < 0.01) and total number of unmet needs (p < 0.001) reported by staff and patients themselves. There was moderate or better agreement on the presence of an unmet need in eight of 26 life domains. Agreement was low in several domains relevant to being a mother-notably pregnancy care, safety to child/others, and practical and emotional childcare domains. Unmet needs were particularly common in the areas of daytime activities, sleep, psychological distress and violence and abuse. Staff and pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness moderately agree about health and social care needs but agree less often on which needs are unmet. This highlights the importance of the views of the mothers themselves, as well as assessments by staff. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Pregnancy impacts common symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), such as energy, appetite, weight change, and sleep and somatic complaints. However, it is not known whether the presentation of depression during pregnancy is different from that at other times in women's lives. This study compares the severity of symptoms of depression in 61 pregnant women with MDD (PD), 50 nonpregnant women with MDD (D), and 41 pregnant women without MDD (P). Despite equivalent overall depression severity, PD women had lower scores on suicidality, guilt, and early insomnia and higher scores on psychomotor retardation than D women. The severity of other depressive symptoms was similar in the two depressed groups. As expected on the basis of the selection criteria, overall depression severity and the severity of individual symptoms were significantly higher in the PD group than in the P group but effect sizes for somatic symptoms were smaller than for psychological symptoms. The results suggest that the profile of depression symptoms of women with MDD who are pregnant does not differ much from that of depressed nonpregnant women. Depressive symptoms, particularly psychological symptoms of depression, during pregnancy should be taken seriously and not be dismissed as a normal part of the pregnancy experience.

N2  - Pregnant black depressed women were compared to pregnant black non-depressed women on self-report stress measures and cortisol levels at mid and late pregnancy and on neonatal outcomes. The depressed women had higher anxiety, anger, daily hassles, sleep disturbance scores and cortisol levels at both prenatal visits. These higher stress levels may have contributed to the greater incidence of prematurity and low birthweight neonatal outcomes noted in the depressed group, and they may partially explain the higher rate of prematurity and low birthweight among black women.

N2  - Objective: To identify factors predictive of either lateral or prone infant sleep positioning. Study design: We used data for 11 340 mother-infant pairs from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for infants born in Washington State, 1996 to 2002. We used predictive modeling to identify statistically significant (P < .05) predictors of lateral and prone sleep positioning. Results: Factors associated with both high-risk sleep positions included infant's year of birth, maternal race and ethnicity, maternal county of residence, and maternal parity. Mother's being US-born (versus foreign-born) and male infant sex were predictive only of prone sleep positioning. Having Medicaid as primary insurance, receipt of government benefits, low infant gestational age, and low birth weight were predictive only of lateral sleep positioning. Conclusions: Factors predictive of either high-risk sleep position should be considered when devising public health intervention strategies for the prevention of SIDS.

N2  - Restless-legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder, characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations. It begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, is partially or totally relieved by movements and is exacerbated or occurs at night and in the evening. RLS sufferers represent 2 to 3% of the general population in Western countries. Supportive criteria include a family history, the presence of periodic-leg movements (PLM) when awake or asleep and a positive response to dopaminergic treatment. The RLS phenotypes include an early onset form, usually idiopathic with a familial history and a late onset form, usually secondary to peripheral neuropathy. Recently, an atypical RLS phenotype without PLM and L-DOPA resistant has been characterized. RLS can occur in childhood and should be distinguished from attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, growing pains and sleep complaints in childhood. RLS should be included in the diagnosis of all patients consulting for sleep complaints or discomfort in the lower limbs. It should be differentiated from akathisia, that is, an urge to move the whole body without uncomfortable sensations. Polysomnographic studies and the suggested immobilization test can detect PLM. Furthermore, an L-DOPA challenge has recently been validated to support the diagnosis of RLS. RLS may cause severe-sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, depressive and anxious symptoms and may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In most cases, RLS is idiopathic. It may also be secondary to iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, peripheral neuropathy and drugs, such as antipsychotics and antidepressants. The small-fiber neuropathy can mimic RLS or even trigger it. RLS is associated with many neurological and sleep disorders including Parkinson's disease, but does not predispose to these diseases. The pathophysiology of RLS includes an altered brain-iron metabolism, a dopaminergic dysfunction, a probable role of pain control systems and a genetic susceptibility with nine loci and three polymorphisms in genes serving developmental functions. RLS treatment begins with the elimination of triggering factors and iron supplementation when deficient. Mild or intermittent RLS is usually treated with low doses of L-DOPA or codeine; the first-line treatment for moderate to severe RLS is dopaminergic agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). In severe, refractory or neuropathy-associated RLS, antiepileptic (gabapentin, pregabalin) or opioid (oxycodone, tramadol) drugs can be used.

N2  - This chapter discusses the author's struggle with her father with bipolar disorder. During my second year of college, I went to the university counseling center with what I presumed to be a fairly simple question: "Am I bipolar?" The counselor who had been assigned to me, probably a pre-doctoral clinical psych intern, looked at me askance and asked me to slow down and back up. I had been having what I considered to be mood swings. Sometimes I was really, really cranky, and sometimes nothing could get me down, I usually needed about 9 or 10 hours of sleep to feel rested, but every once in awhile there was a week or two in which I really only needed 5, I cried more easily than other people. Oh, and I was the youngest child of a father who had bipolar disorder. I had been reading and rereading my introductory psychology text: "The age of onset of bipolar disorder is typically in the late teens or early twenties." I was 19, almost 20, I burned the paragraph about the high heritability of bipolar disorder and its cardinal symptoms into my brain. Would I get 'lucky" and only have bipolar type II, without any of the psychosis associated with bipolar I? Or maybe cyclothymia, the low-grade, chronic form of bipolar disorder? Questions such as these peppered my thoughts for weeks. The counselor asked me a lot of questions, trying to determine some other area of stress in my life. I tried valiantly to convince him that classes weren't stressful, that I wasn't pregnant or having unsafe sex and that I wasn't having a fight with my boyfriend. "Isn't there some kind of test?" I asked, still completely naive to how crude the psychological diagnostic system actually remains, "Can't you just check to see if maybe I have it?" He gave me the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, an extremely long personality test used to assess for many areas of psychological functioning, and told me to come back the following week for a consultation.

N2  - Objective: The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence, duration and risk factors for benign neonatal sleep myoclonus (BNSM) in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) treated with opioids or sedatives, compared with control infants. Methods: This is a single centre observational case control study. Seventy-eight near term and term infants with neonatal opiate abstinence syndrome confirmed by meconium analysis were included. Exclusion criteria were cerebral malformation, intracranial hemorrhage and perinatal asphyxia. The babies were assessed eight hourly with a modified Finnegan score that included sleep myoclonus. Seventy-eight infants not exposed to opiates during pregnancy, hospitalized for at least 14 days and matched for gestational age were used as controls. Results: The median gestational age was 38 1/7 (95% CI: 35 3/7–41 2/7) weeks, birth weight 2730 (95% CI: 1890–3600) g, umbilical artery pH 7.25 (CI 7.10–7.37) and Apgar score at 5 minutes 9 (95% CI: 7–10). The control infants did not differ in these characteristics. Sleep myoclonus was diagnosed in 52 (67%) of the infants with NAS and 2 (2.6%) of the controls (OR 26 [95% CI: 7–223], p2.5 mmol/L at first occurrence. The neurological examinations as well as cerebral ultrasound scans were normal. An electroencephalogram (EEG) carried out in 18 infants showed no signs of epileptic activity. Conclusion: BNSM has a high incidence in infants with NAS. The diagnosis can be made clinically. In the absence of other neurological symptoms further investigations such as EEG are not necessary and anticonvulsive treatment is not indicated.

N2  - Objective: This study was conducted to clarify the prevalence of alcohol consumption among pregnant women in Japan and its associated factors. Method: 344 institutions participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2006. Each subject was requested to fill out a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy were examined using the chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis. Results: The number of effective responses was 18,965. The prevalence of alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy and during pregnancy was 44.6% and 4.6% respectively. The following items were recognized as being associated with promoting alcohol consumption during pregnancy: greater number of weeks of pregnancy, more pregnancies, fewer years of schooling, being employed, an alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, ignorance about the effects of alcohol consumption on fetuses, receiving advice regarding alcohol abstention, difficulty maintaining sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Conclusion: It is important to have a more comprehensive understanding of the factors associated with the alcohol consumption behavior of pregnant women, as revealed in the present study, in order to develop future policies for preventing alcohol consumption among pregnant women.

N2  - Study Objectives: Pregnant women have an increased risk of experiencing restless legs syndrome (RLS). Aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between pregnancy-related hormonal and metabolic changes and RLS symptomatology. Design: Blood measurements and overnight polysomnography were performed during the third trimester of pregnancy and again 3 months after delivery. We investigated blood hormonal levels (estradiol, prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], iron, ferritin, hemoglobin) and polysomnographic sleep parameters. Subjective sleep quality and RLS symptoms were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the International RLS study group (IRLSSG) rating scale. Setting: Sleep laboratory. Participants: Ten pregnant women fulfilling the IRLSSG criteria for RLS diagnosis and 9 pregnant healthy controls underwent the protocol. Interventions: N/A. Results: Women with RLS showed higher levels of estradiol during pregnancy compared to controls (34,211±6,397 pg/mL vs. 25,475±7,990 pg/mL, P<0.05). Patients also showed more periodic limb movements (PLMs) before and after delivery, particularly during sleep stage 1 and wakefulness (P<0.05). PLMs decreased postpartum in subjects with RLS only (P<0.05); sleep efficiency increased in women without RLS and remained unchanged in patients (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between groups before or after delivery in plasma concentrations of prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, FSH, LH, iron, ferritin or hemoglobin. Conclusions: RLS in pregnant women goes along with transiently increased estradiol levels and PLM indices suggesting that estrogens play a pathophysiological role for triggering RLS symptoms during pregnancy.

N2  - This study explored self-care needs, practices and relevant contextual factors (e.g., work, infant needs, support and ideas about the mother role), and associations between self-care and mood, among middle-class Euro-American mothers (n = 20). Data were drawn from a larger study of parenting and infant development (C. Super and S. Harkness, Principal Investigators). Data from the third trimester of pregnancy, five days, two weeks, two months and six months postpartum were used. Self-care is understudied in terms of its meanings and the factors that influence it, particularly among non-clinical samples. Self-care may benefit mothers regardless of clinical status. This knowledge contributes to a theoretical understanding of maternal experience and well-being during a period that poses many personal, social and familial challenges for women. The findings also offer information useful to practitioners and programs that serve expectant or early postpartum mothers. The measures consisted of a semi-structured interview and a checklist of 30 mood descriptors, positive and negative, that was administered in mothers' homes at each time point. Interviews focused on daily routines, social support and contacts, general experiences of motherhood, and important things to do for the infant and oneself. The mood checklist included a range of feelings; mothers indicated at the end of each of three daily time allocation diaries the extent to which they had experienced each of the 30 mood states. Results indicated that physical self-care (e.g., sleep) and social engagement were the most common need across time. A diverse range of practices were discussed, but social activities and going "out" were the most widely cited practices. Mothers managed to enact these despite the presence of constraints related to physical and social settings, and employed strategies such as taking the infant along to facilitate social involvement. Physical self-care and quiet or alone time were two needs that in some cases appeared to be unmet. Self-expectations related to the mother role appear likely to have influenced self-care in a negative manner. Physical self-care practices at five days postnatal bore the most prominent associations to positive mood at the group level and when individual mothers were grouped.

N2  - Background and Purpose: Sleep quality seems to be an antecedent to depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We sought to 1) examine the psychometrics of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in pregnancy; 2) examine whether sleep quality predicted increases in depressive symptoms; and 3) compare PSQI scores across 3 or 2 levels of depressive symptoms. Methods: Each of the 252 participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (short form) and a sleep quality measure at mid and late pregnancy. Results: PSQI total scores showed good internal consistency and construct validity. An improved model of the internal structure of the PSQI in pregnancy was found with 1 factor labeled Sleep Efficiency, a second labeled Night and Daytime Disturbances, and an Overall Sleep Quality component associated with, but separate from, both of these 2 factors. Although PSQI scores showed moderate stability over time, sleep disturbance scores increased in late pregnancy. Importantly, PSQI prospectively predicted increases in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the PSQI is useful in pregnancy research. Findings also support the idea that sleep problems are prospective risk factors for increases in depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Practitioners are advised to screen for sleep quality during early pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is common in asthma patients and can contribute to sleep disruption. The aim of the present study was to determine the time-related distribution of GER events together with their impact on sleep in asthmatic subjects with GER disease symptoms. The inclusion criteria were: 18-65 years, controlled moderate to severe asthma and GER-compatible clinical evidence. The exclusion criteria were: chronic obstructive lung disease, smoking, infections of the upper airways, use of oral corticosteroids, other co-morbidities, pregnancy, sleep-related disorders, night-time shift work, and the use of substances with impact on sleep. Asthmatic patients with nocturnal symptoms were excluded. All-night polysomnography and esophageal pH monitoring were recorded simultaneously. Of the 147 subjects selected, 31 patients and 31 controls were included. Seventeen patients were classified as DeMeester positive and 14 as DeMeester negative. Both groups displayed similar outcomes when general variables were considered. Sleep stage modification one minute prior to GER was observed in the DeMeester-positive group. Awakening was the most frequent occurrence at GER onset and during the 1-min period preceding 38% of the nocturnal GER. Sleep stage 2 was also prevalent and preceded 36% of GER events. In the DeMeester-negative group, awakening was the most frequent response before and during GER. Modifications in sleep stages, arousals or awakenings were associated with 75% of the total GER events analyzed during the period of one minute before and after the fall of esophageal pH below 4 in the DeMeester-positive group. These data provide evidence that sleep modifications precede the GER events in asthmatic patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate relationships among women's body attitudes, physical symptoms, self-esteem, depression, and sleep quality during pregnancy. Pregnant women (N = 215) at 15-25 weeks gestation completed a questionnaire including four body image subscales assessing self-reported feeling fat, attractiveness, strength/fitness, and salience of weight and shape. Women reported on 29 pregnancy-related physical complaints, and completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. In regressions, controlling for retrospective reports of body image, more frequent and intense physical symptoms were related to viewing the self as less strong/fit, and to poorer sleep quality and more depressive symptoms. In a multi-factorial model extending previous research, paths were found from sleep quality to depressive symptoms to self-esteem; self-esteem was found to be a mediator associated with lower scores on feeling fat and salience of weight and shape, and on higher perceived attractiveness.

N2  - Pre-eclampsia is a life threatening disease that is specific for pregnancy. It affects 9% of pregnant population and it has negative implications on the health of the mother and the fetus. It is characterized by high Blood Pressure (equal or above to 140/80mmHg), increased protein in the urine (equal or above .03g/24 hour collection), and general edema. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep breathing disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of breathing cessation accompanied by oxygen desaturation and/or arousal. It occurs in 4% in women and 9% in men and is under diagnosed especially among women. Both pre-eclampsia and OSA share a significant overlap in risk factors especially hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases in general. The objective of this study is to examine the association between pre-eclampsia and OSA and the specific aim is to test the hypothesis that the pre-eclamptic women are at higher risk of OSA than women with normal uncomplicated pregnancies. It is a clinic-based case control study. Cases were all pre-eclamptic patients admitted to University of Louisville (UofL) hospital or attending the high risk maternity clinic between August20-November30, 2007. Controls were healthy pregnant women attending UofL continuity clinic during the same period. Patients were asked to complete three questionnaires: the Berlin questionnaire, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Fatigue Severity Scale. Demographic data was also collected. Distributions of study subjects with respect to the different variables were calculated. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated for risk of OSA, excessive daytime sleepiness, and fatigue. The results show that pre-eclamptic women are at higher risk of having OSA, excessive daytime sleepiness, and fatigue than healthy pregnant women. Most demographic characteristics like age, race, height, BMI, weight gain, family history of OSA, previous history of OSA, smoking, and alcohol use were not significant except for county of residence and pre-existing medical condition(s). Large epidemiologic studies with overnight polysomnographic studies (PSG) are needed to confirm this association. If the association is further confirmed by future studies then screening for OSA in pre-eclamptic women may become a part of the routine prenatal check up.

N2  - The main concerns associated with epilepsy during pregnancy consist of maternal and fetal risks from uncontrolled seizures, and harmful effects of the treatment on the development of the offspring. Although seizure control is maintained in the majority, worsening occurs in a fraction of childbearing women with epilepsy. As multiple factors associated with pregnancy may have a negative impact on epilepsy, a careful analysis of the situation should be performed in those who deteriorate. Emotional and behavioural influence, including insufficient sleep and treatment non-compliance, as well as physical factors, such as emesis and pelvic distortion, should receive attention. The serum concentrations of almost all antiepileptic drugs decrease during pregnancy, particularly those which are metabolised by glucuronidation. The inter-individual variability is pronounced. In highly protein-bound drugs, such as phenytoin and valproate, unbound drug is less affected than total concentrations. Lamotrigine and levetiracetam concentrations may decrease by more than 50% in the course of pregnancy; monohydroxyoxcarbazepine by up to 30-40%. Appropriate clinical follow-up tailored to individual needs and supported by therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed in pregnant women with epilepsy. Education concerning reproductive issues is an essential part of the epilepsy service to fertile women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is clinically defined by the presence of (i) an urge to move the legs with or without an actual paraesthesia; (ii) a worsening of symptoms with inactivity; (iii) improvement with activity; and (iv) a worsening of symptoms in the evening and at night. Patients may use a variety of semantic phrases to describe their symptoms but all must have an urge to move. Most people with RLS also have periodic limb movements during sleep, although this is not part of the clinical diagnostic criteria. RLS is very common. About 10% of all Caucasian populations have RLS, although it may be mild in the majority of cases. Women generally outnumber men by about 2:1. As a general rule, RLS severity worsens through the first seven to eight decades of life, but may actually lessen in old age. The aetiology of RLS is only partly understood. There is a strong genetic component, and several genetic linkages and three causative genes have been identified worldwide. Several medical conditions, including renal failure, systemic iron deficiency and pregnancy, and possibly neuropathy, essential tremor and some genetic ataxias, are also associated with high rates of RLS. In all cases to date, the actual CNS pathology of RLS demonstrates reduced iron stores, in a pattern that suggests that the homeostatic control of iron is altered, not just that there is not enough iron entering the brain. The relationship between reduced CNS iron levels and the clinical phenotype or treatment response to dopaminergics is not known but generates promising speculation. Treatment of RLS is usually rewarding. Most patients respond robustly to dopamine receptor agonists. Over time, response may lessen, or the patients may develop 'augmentation', whereby they have a worsening of symptoms, usually in the form of an earlier onset. Other treatment options include gabapentin, or similar antiepileptic drugs, and opioids. High-dose intravenous iron is a promising but still experimental approach.

N2  - Research suggests that the attitude of men towards pregnancy, childbirth and child-caring is different from that of women. Up to now, research has focused mainly on motherhood. The aim of this study was to explore first-time fathers' experiences during early infancy of their children. Grounded theory and constant comparative method were used and 20 fathers aged 20-48 participated. Interviews were carried out in 2002-2003. 'Changing life' emerged as the core category consisting of the categories: becoming a father, alternating between work and home, changing relationship towards partner and developing relationship with their child. Changing life implied that they have left bachelor life and become responsible for a child. Becoming a father was much more fantastic than they could have imagined and they suggested that they performed childcare to the same extent as the mother when both parents were at home. Still fathers viewed the mother as the main parent, partly because of their alternating between work and home and because the mothers breast-feed the infants. Fathers' attitude towards breastfeeding seemed to be ambiguous; it was a matter of necessity, but made them feel insignificant. Changing relationship towards partner was common but it was not necessarily for the worst and often resulted in a more closely united relationship. However, tiredness because of lack of sleep could result in increased irritability towards problems. Developing relationship with their child implied increasing possibilities to learn to know the infant's signals. Fathers are one of two parents, and hence are important for their child's growth and development, emotional health and cognitive development. Knowledge about first-time fathers' experiences during the early infancy of their children may bring about increased support from midwives and child health nurses.

N2  - Background: Infants exposed prenatally to alcohol are at increased risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Aim: To examine the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure, sleep, arousal and sleep-related spontaneous motor movements in early infancy. Study design: Low-income women (N = 13) were interviewed regarding pre- and pregnancy rates of alcohol, cigarette smoking and other substance use in the perinatal period. Infants were examined in a laboratory nap study using EEG, videography and actigraphy at 6–8 weeks of age. Estimates of maternal pre- and pregnancy alcohol use were used to divide infants into high vs. low maternal alcohol use groups. Subjects: Mother–infant dyads recruited from a family practice clinic. Outcome measures: Sleep-related spontaneous movements, behavioral state, and maternal assessments of infant alertness and irritability. Results: Pre-pregnancy rates of alcohol consumption including binge drinking correlated with maternal report of poor infant alertness, and increased irritability. High maternal exposure groups showed increased sleep fragmentation, e.g. frequency and duration of wakefulness following sleep onset and decreased active sleep. Bout analysis of the temporal structure of sleep-related spontaneous movements showed significantly reduced bout duration associated with high maternal alcohol use. Conclusion: These results present evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts postnatal sleep organization and suppresses spontaneous movements during sleep, and increased sleep fragmentation promotes sleep deprivation. Results are consistent with the SIDS model of chronic sleep debt and suggest that attenuated sleep-related movements should be examined as an important modulator of cardiorespiratory functions during sleep in high-risk groups.

N2  - Background: Pregnant women's sleep disturbance due to fetal movement is well known. Fetal movement is thought to be an index of fetal well-being. However, as there has never been a way to easily and reliably record fetal movement, psychophysiological studies of pregnant women's sleep disturbance and fetal well-being have not been done. Aims: To solve these methodological issues, we developed a new sensor with electrostatic capacity that can pick up acceleration of fetal movement. Methods and results: Experiment I: We verified the reliability of our fetal movement recording system. Thirty-two pregnant women (from 19 to 39 weeks of gestation) were asked to lie down on a bed for about 1 h and to press a button as a subjective marker when they felt fetal movement. We simultaneously recorded maternal polysomnograms and fetal movement from the mothers' abdomens using a Medilog recorder. The mean of prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa for agreements, based on time between fetal movement signals recorded and subjective maternal markers, was substantial at 0.75. Experiment II: We recorded seven pregnant women's polysomnograms and fetal movement simultaneously during all-night sleep at home using our sensor during weeks 33 and 36 of gestation. We succeeded in recording maternal micro-arousals evoked by fetal movement. The mean value of the number of micro-arousals at 33 weeks was slightly larger than that at 36 weeks. Conclusions: There was a high agreement between subjective maternal markers and fetal movement. Our recording system using the new sensor can be used for home monitoring of fetal movement.

N2  - Choline supplementation of the maternal diet has long-term facilitative effects on spatial and temporal memory processes in the offspring. To further delineate the impact of early nutritional status on brain and behavior, we examined effects of prenatal-choline availability on hippocampal oscillatory frequency bands in 12 month-old male and female rats. Adult offspring of time-pregnant dams that were given a deficient level of choline (DEF = 0.0 g/kg), sufficient choline (CON = 1.1 g/kg) or supplemental choline (SUP = 3.5 g/kg) in their chow during embryonic days (ED) 12-17 were implanted with an electroencephalograph (EEG) electrode in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in combination with an electromyograph (EMG) electrode patch implanted in the nuchal muscle. Five consecutive 8-h recording sessions revealed differential patterns of EEG activity as a function of awake, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep states and prenatal choline status. The main finding was that SUP rats displayed increased power levels of gamma (30-100 Hz) band oscillations during all phases of the sleep/wake cycle. These findings are discussed within the context of a general review of neuronal oscillations (e.g., delta, theta, and gamma bands) and synchronization across multiple brain regions in relation to sleep-dependent memory consolidation in the hippocampus.

N2  - Aims: Prenatal exposure to alcohol can have adverse effects on the developing fetus. Two of the hallmarks of children exposed to alcohol prenatally are attention deficits and hyperactivity. While hyperactivity has been observed in rats following prenatal ethanol exposure, few studies have examined these effects in mice. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on activity in mice from three inbred strains: C57BL6 (B6), Inbred Long Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short Sleep (ISS). Methods: On Days 7 through 18 of gestation, mice were intragastrically intubated twice daily with either 3.0 gkg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltosedextrin (MD); non-intubated control (NIC) litters were also generated. Offspring activity was monitored at 30, 60, 90 and 150 days of age. Results: While results showed no effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on any measures of activity, we did observe differences in baseline activity among the strains. ISS mice were more active than B6 and ILS for all activity measures except stereotypy; B6 mice had higher measures of stereotypy than ILS and ISS. Younger mice were more active than older mice. The only sex effects were on measures of stereotypy, where males had higher scores. Conclusions: Mice are an excellent organism to study genetic influences on many phenotypes. However, our study and others have shown few effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on behavior in mice. It appears as if the prenatal period in mice, corresponding to organogenesis, is not a sensitive period for producing behavioral deficits following ethanol exposure. It is likely that the first 2 weeks postnatally, corresponding to the brain growth spurt, are more sensitive for producing behavioral effects.

N2  - The treatment of bipolar disorder (BPD) in women is complicated by reproductive life events such as pregnancy and breastfeeding. This presents a clinical challenge to clinicians and patients who must balance risk of recurrent mood episodes against risks of potential teratogenic and adverse side effects of medications. It is important for the clinician and patient to develop an individualized plan of care during conception, pregnancy, delivery and postpartum to ensure maximum safety and minimal risks. Pregnant women with BPD have the same risk of mood episodes as women who are not pregnant. There is clearly an increased risk for the development of mood episodes in the postpartum period — approximately 22—50% of women with BPD will develop postpartum depression (PPD). Risk factors for PPD in women with BPD include having a family history of PPD and depressive symptoms during pregnancy, but this risk can be significantly reduced with prophylactic medications. The risk for postpartum psychosis (PPP) is also significant, and most cases occur in the first 3 days following delivery. Risk factors include a history of an index manic episode, positive family history, and sleep deprivation during delivery. Lithium is the first choice for mood stabilization during pregnancy for women with severe illness. The typical antipsychotics also appear to be relatively safe during pregnancy. Venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazepine, and the tricyclic antidepressants also all appear to be relatively safe in pregnancy. Patients should be monitored carefully during pregnancy. As the pregnancy progresses physiologic changes occur that alter the excretion of drugs and drug levels may change significantly, necessitating dose adjustments. In addition, factors such as vomiting due to morning sickness must be taken into account. Postpartum, women should be closely monitored, in labor and delivery, and at home. Medication changes made during pregnancy may have to be reversed as physiology changes. If women choose to breastfeed, the pediatrician should be part of the clinical team. It is important to use a team approach when treating BPD during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: In utero exposure to smoking is known to adversely affect brain regions involved in behavioral state organization and could therefore interact with the neurophysiological development of neonates. Study Objectives: The present study investigated the effects of prenatal smoking exposure on sleep patterns in the preterm neonate. Design: Overnight sleep patterns were polysomnographically assessed at thermoneutrality. Sleep continuity and structure were scored for the respective frequencies, durations and percentages of active, quiet, and indeterminate sleep and wakefulness after sleep onset. The number and duration of body movements were also analyzed. Setting: The neonatal intensive care unit at Amiens University Medical Center (France). Participants: Healthy preterm neonates (postconceptional age: 33.9 ± 6.0 weeks) were enrolled according to whether their mothers had not smoked at all during pregnancy (control group, n = 19), smoked less during pregnancy (low-smoking group, Slow, n = 10), or smoked more (heavy-smoking group, Sheavy, n = 10) than 10 cigarettes per day throughout pregnancy. Measurements and Results: Neonates born to heavy-smoking mothers had a significantly lower mean birth weight than controls (–21%) and displayed disrupted sleep structure and continuity: they slept less overall (with a higher proportion of active sleep and a lower proportion of quiet sleep) and had more wakefulness after sleep onset. Compared with controls, neonates from both smoking groups displayed more body movements and, as a result, more disturbed sleep. Conclusions: High prenatal smoking exposure modifies sleep patterns in preterm neonates by disrupting sleep organization and increasing nocturnal body movements. These findings raise the question of the repercussions of these sleep disturbances (at what is a critical stage in brain development) on the child's physiological and neurobehavioral outcomes.

N2  - Maternal psychological functioning during pregnancy affects both maternal and fetal well-being. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis provides one mechanism through which maternal psychosocial factors may be transduced to the fetus. However, few studies have examined maternal psychological factors or birth outcomes in relation to the diurnal pattern of cortisol across the day. The current study examined maternal psychological well-being, parity status, and birth weight in relation to the maternal cortisol diurnal rhythm in a group of 98 low-risk pregnant women (51 primiparae). At 36 weeks gestation, participants completed both pregnancy-specific and general self-report measures of psychological functioning and provided saliva samples at 8:00, 12:00, and 16:00 h on 2 consecutive working days for the assay of cortisol. The expected diurnal decline in salivary cortisol was observed. Higher trait anxiety was associated with a flatter afternoon decline for all mothers. For primiparae, steeper morning cortisol declines were associated with lower infant birth weight. The findings suggest that regulation of the HPA axis may differ by parity status with downstream implications for fetal growth and development.

N2  - Four hundred and thirty pregnant women were recruited at approximately 22 weeks gestation at prenatal clinics. Of these, 86 (20%) were diagnosed as depressed. The women were seen again at approximately 32 weeks gestation and after delivery. Chronicity of depression was evidenced by continuing high depression scores in those women diagnosed as depressed. Comorbid problems were chronically high anxiety, anger, sleep disturbance, and pain scores. Less optimal outcomes for the depressed women included lower gestational age and lower birthweight of their newborns. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Synchrony--a construct used across multiple fields to denote the temporal relationship between events--has been applied to the study of mother-infant interaction and is suggested here as a framework for the study of interpersonal relationships. Defined as the temporal coordination of micro-level social behavior, parent-infant synchrony is charted in its development across infancy from the initial consolidation of biological rhythms during pregnancy to the emergence of symbolic exchange between parent and child. Synchrony is shown to depend on physiological mechanisms supporting bond formation in mammals--particularly physiological oscillators and neuroendocrine systems such as those involving the hormone oxytocin. Developmental outcomes of the synchrony experience are observed in the domains of self-regulation, symbol use, and the capacity for empathy across childhood and adolescence. Specific disruptions to the parameters of synchrony that may be observed in various pathological conditions, such as prematurity or maternal affective disorder, are detailed. A time-based, micro-analytic behavioral approach to the study of human relationship may offer new insights on intersubjectivity across the lifespan.

N2  - Objective: To identify biological and socioeconomic factors associated with the neurological development of Mexican infants born at term, as measured by brainstem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEPs). Subjects and Methods: We conducted a cohort study among 76 women with low risk pregnancies recruited in their third trimester of pregnancy and followed their infants until 12 months of age. BAEP tests were conducted on the infants before 3 months of age during physiologic sleep, using 100 msec bipolar clicks. Maternal dietary intake was evaluated by food frequency questionnaire. Two BAEP groups (short latency, long latency) were identified by cluster analysis. The association between BAEP group and maternal PUFAs was estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for socioeconomic and biological factors. Results: Short latency BAEPs were associated with a maternal diet rich in arachidonic acid (OR = 3.63, 95% CI 1.23-10.67) after adjusting for age (in days) sex, head circumference and gestational age but was not significantly associated to a maternal diet rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Conclusions: Our results suggest the importance of arachidonic acid intake during pregnancy for short latency BAEPs and adequate fetal myelination.

N2  - Over the past 40 years, it has been recognised that the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis undergoes adaptations through pregnancy and lactation that might contribute to avoidance of adverse effects of stress on the mother and offspring. The extent of the global adaptations in the HPA axis has been revealed and the underlying mechanisms investigated within the last 20 years. Both basal, including the circadian rhythm, and stress-induced adrenocorticotrophic hormone and glucocorticoid secretory patterns are altered. Throughout most of pregnancy, and in lactation, these changes predominantly reflect reduced drive by the cortico-tropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurones in the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pPVN). An accompanying profound attenuation of HPA axis responses to a wide variety of psychological and physical stressors emerges after mid-pregnancy and persists until the end of lactation. Central to this suppression of stress responsiveness is reduced activation of the pPVN CRF neurones. This is consequent on the reduced effectiveness of the stimulation of brainstem afferents to these CRF neurones (for physical stressors) and of altered processing by limbic structures (for emotional stressors). The mechanism of reduced CRF neurone responses to physical stressors in pregnancy is the suppression of noradrenaline release in the PVN by an up-regulated endogenous opioid mechanism, which is induced by neuroactive steroid produced from progesterone. By contrast, in lactation suckling the young provides a neural stimulus that dampens the HPA axis circadian rhythm and reduces stress responses. Reduced noradrenergic input activity is involved in reduced stress responses in lactation, although central prolactin action also appears important. Such adaptations limit the adverse effects of excess glucocorticoid exposure on the foetus(es) and facilitate appropriate metabolic and immune responses.

N2  - Maternal experience of stress during pregnancy can have a lasting impact on infant regulation development. Research suggests that the Hypothalamic Adrenal (HPA) axis transmits maternal stress to the fetus and that these effects can be observed in infant regulatory behaviors such as temperament and sleep patterns. However, examining prenatal maternal cortisol as a mediator of prenatal maternal stress and infant regulation has not been observed in human populations. Therefore, the present study investigated this relationship using a prospective design with a community sample of 92 participants in the 3rd trimester of their pregnancies. Participants were interviewed a second time when the infants were 3 months old. A.M. and P.M. salivary maternal cortisol and self report measures for prenatal stress (depression, anxiety, life stress, daily hassles, and perceived stress) and pregnancy related conditions were examined at Time 1. At Time 2, self report measures of postnatal stress (depression, anxiety, life stress, daily hassles, and perceived stress), general health, infant sleep and temperament with the Infant Behavior Scale were completed. Hierarchical Linear Regression controlling for postnatal stress, showed that cortisol was not a significant mediator. However, prenatal stress did predict aspects of infant regulation. Specifically, mental stress predicted infant activity (beta = -.24, p<.05) and sleep (beta = .40, p<.05) and life stress predicted attention (beta = -.24, p<.05). Postnatal analyses (controlling for prenatal stress) showed that, perceived stress experienced by the mother directly (beta = .21, p <.05) and indirectly through parenting effects (beta = -.24, p<.05) attention. Implications from this study not only highlight the need for further research on the role of cortisol as a mediator of prenatal stress and infant regulation, but also the need to incorporate these findings into clinical and physical assessments for earlier identification of pregnant women whose children may be at risk for possible negative developmental consequences.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a "mindful-yoga" intervention for healthy pregnant women that blended elements of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Iyengar style prenatal yoga, on stress, anxiety, sleep, and pain; to estimate statistical power and sample size for a larger study; and to establish whether the treatment is effective for second or third trimester women. The effects of variables on mindful-yoga were studied over time, comparing baseline (Time1) and post-intervention (Time2) data in a single treatment group of 19 English-speaking nulliparous women with healthy pregnancies, 17 of whom adhered to the intervention that met for seven weekly sessions. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, correlations, parametric and nonparametric paired comparisons, and effect sizes. Participants were well-educated, middleclass, and planning vaginal birth. Although no one was currently being treated for psychiatric disorders, nearly 30% had a history of depression or anxiety. The intervention resulted in higher scores for two facets of mindfulness (Observing and Nonreacting). From Time1 to Time2, third trimester participants demonstrated significant reductions in perceived stress and trait anxiety. Second trimester women demonstrated improvements in pain and sleep. In contrast, the third trimester group experienced worse pain and sleep as pregnancy progressed. To control for gestation, Time1 data for the 8 women who began mindful-yoga in the third trimester (26.5 weeks +2.3) were compared with Time2 data for the 9 women who began mindful-yoga in the second trimester (27.1 weeks +4.1). Second trimester women at Time2 experienced improved sleep (fewer night awakenings and less wake time during the night) as measured by wrist actigraphy compared to third trimester group baseline data. This study demonstrated important clinical improvements in sleep and pain for women who began mindful-yoga in their second trimester. Mindful-yoga intervention merits further research for reducing perceived stress and anxiety and second trimester sleep enhancement and pain reduction. The mechanisms of mindful-yoga on stress appraisal, anxiety, sleep, and pain were not clearly linked to mindfulness, and further studies are required to develop theoretical linkages between mindful-yoga and symptom reduction during pregnancy.

N2  - This descriptive correlation study had four purposes: describe depressive and anxiety symptom levels in pregnant and non-pregnant African American (AA) HIV-positive women, examine the association between underlying vulnerabilities and depressive symptoms in HIV-positive AA women, determine the association between underlying vulnerabilities and anxiety symptoms in AA HIV-positive women, and determine the predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms among African American HIV-positive women. A convenience sample of 80 African American HIV-positive women was recruited from university-based obstetrics/-gynecology and infectious disease practices in a large metropolitan city in the Mid-South. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Edinburgh Postnatal depression Scale (EPDS). Anxiety symptoms were measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). An investigator-developed demographic data form was used to obtain patient characteristics including data about inherited and acquired vulnerabilities. Inherited vulnerabilities included family history of mood disorders and family history of alcohol and/or drug use. Acquired vulnerabilities included educational level, income level, alcohol and/or use, HIV disclosure status, sleep quality, and history of sexual assault. The stress diathesis theory provided the conceptual basis for the study. The sample consisted of both pregnant (n = 20) and non-pregnant (n = 60) women. Participants were typically single (57.5%), middle-aged (33.21 + 10.7 years), and had completed high school (30%) or some college (35%). Poverty was prevalent in the sample, with 70.5% reporting annual household incomes below $10,000. Most women (92.5%) had disclosed their HIV status. Almost half of the sample (42%) reported a history of sexual assault. Substance abuse was higher in the non-pregnant group of women (40%) than the non-pregnant group (5%) of women. Median depressive symptom scores for the total sample were mildly elevated. Median anxiety symptom scores for the total sample illustrated little or no anxiety symptoms. Poor sleep quality was prevalent in both groups and was associated with elevated CES-D, EPDS, and BAI scores in both groups of women. Family history of mood disorders was associated with elevated CES-D scores in the group of pregnant women, and elevated BAI scores in both groups. HIV disclosure was associated with elevated CES-D scores in the pregnant group, and substance use with elevated CES-D scores, in the non-pregnant group. Non-pregnant HIV-positive women had higher depressive symptom scores on both the CES-D and EPDS when compared to pregnant HIV-positive women. Regression analyses were performed to determine which independent variables predicted elevated depressive and anxiety symptom scores. Substance use and poor sleep quality were statistically significant predictors, ac counting for 55% of the variance in CES-D scores, 43% of the variance in EPDS scores, and 53% of the variance in BAI scores. Future studies should include testing interventions that improve sleep quality. Untreated mood disorders are problematic in HIV-positive patients, as depression is associated with decreased adherence to highly active antiretroviral medications. Ongoing assessments of depressive and anxiety symptoms are necessary, as clinically significant levels resulting in referrals were warranted.

N2  - For the first time, the relationship between depressive symptoms and sleep quality was explored prospectively during pregnancy. Participants (n = 273) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Beck Depression Inventory at three 8-week intervals, starting from 15-23 weeks gestation. In addition to sleep quality and depression remaining relatively stable during pregnancy, findings revealed that sleep quality earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms at later stage in pregnancy (after controlling for prior depression levels). In contrast, there was no evidence to suggest that depressive symptoms earlier in pregnancy impacted on sleep quality later on. Given that depressive symptomatology can lead to major depression and given the prevalence of pre- and postnatal depression, our findings suggest that screening for sleep problems during pregnancy may be of clinical significance.

N2  - This study re-examined the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant women in Japan based on the diagnostic criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG), and to epidemiologically clarify factors associated with RLS, including sleep disorders and pregnancy status. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at 344 clinical obstetric institutions in Japan. A total of 19 441 women with a confirmed pregnancy were instructed to complete a self-administered questionnaire during the time they spent waiting for a consultation. univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used. The prevalence of RLS among the women was 2.9%. The prevalence by age group exhibited a U-shaped curve with the value for those in their thirties as the minimum. The prevalence became more than twice higher in the third trimester of pregnancy. There were stronger associations between RLS and the third trimester of pregnancy, multipara, smoking, subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, early morning awakening and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR: 1.92, 0.76, 1.54, 1.68, 2.44, 1.80, 1.89, respectively). The prevalence of RLS among pregnant women in Japan was not as high as previously reported, similar to that for the general Japanese population. As the prevalence of RLS is lower than that in Western countries, genetic backgrounds may contribute more to the observed differences than pregnancy does. In this study, like others, the prevalence of RLS increased during the third trimester of pregnancy, and strong associations were observed between RLS and difficulty initiating sleep and between RLS and difficulty maintaining sleep.

N2  - Objectives: To describe different sleep disorders and daytime sleepiness in a French population of randomly selected young women during pregnancy and to evaluate the frequency of these sleep disorders according to the three trimesters of pregnancy. Methods: Cross-sectional design with retrospective survey of pre-pregnancy, symptoms and prospective survey of current symptoms. Mothers were interviewed during pregnancy with a questionnaire to evaluate their sleep before pregnancy and to assess alterations in their sleep according to the trimester. Results: 871 pregnant women completed the questionnaire. The rate of pregnant women with insomnia with non-refreshing sleep and frequent awakenings increases during the second and the third trimester reaching more than 75% of the women, essentially due to an urge to urinate, movements of the fetus, backache and restless legs syndrome. Snoring also increases throughout the pregnancy with more than 18% of them snoring every night. Conversely, more than 75% of the women complained of a decrease in their vigilance and a need to nap inreased during the pregnancy. Conclusions: The subjective quality of sleep is disturbed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy and increases throughout the pregnancy, except for excessive daytime sleepiness which was more frequent during the first trimester.

N2  - Several modifiable pre- and postnatal determinants of childhood overweight are known, but no one has examined how they influence risk of overweight in combination. We estimated the risk of overweight at age 3 years according to levels of maternal smoking during pregnancy, gestational weight gain, breastfeeding duration, and infant sleep duration. We studied 1,110 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort study. The main outcome measure was child overweight (BMI for age and sex ≥95th percentile) at age 3. We ran logistic regression models with all four modifiable risk factors as well as the covariates maternal BMI and education, child race/ethnicity, and household income. From the model, we obtained the estimated probability of overweight for each of the 16 combinations of the four risk factors. During pregnancy, 9.8% of mothers smoked and 50% gained excessive weight. In infancy, 73% mother-child pairs breastfed for <12m, and 31 % of infants slept <12h/day. Among the 3-year-old children in the cohort, 9.5% were overweight. In the prediction model, the estimated probability of overweight ranged from 0.06 among children exposed to favorable levels of all four risk factors, to 0.29 with adverse levels of all four. Healthful levels of four behaviors during early development predicted much lower probability of overweight at age 3 than adverse levels. Interventions to modify several factors during pregnancy and infancy could have substantial impact on prevention of childhood overweight. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Rationale: Psychological factors are acknowledged to impact on pregnancy, birth, neonatal outcomes and maternal mental health. The importance of psychological well-being is now recognized within maternity care and UK maternity policy advocates choice and control, equating this to increased quality of experience and improved psychological outcomes. There remains, however, lack of substantive and consistent evidence with regard to the psychological benefits of choice in maternity care. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of choice of maternity care on psychological health outcomes. Methods: 165 antenatal women were recruited and sampled according to their choices for care. Women were assessed utilizing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC), SF-36, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Culture Free Self-esteem Inventory (CFSEI) at 12 and 32 weeks pregnant and 14 days and 6 months postnatal. Results: No significant differences between groups were revealed on any of the scales or subscales measured. Significant and corresponding differences were identified within groups over time for CWS socio-medical worries, MHLC 'powerful others', SF-36 bodily pain, vitality personal health and change in health, PSQI global sleep. An interaction effect for CFSEI general and social self-esteem was revealed between birth centre and midwifery-led care/main unit women at 14 days postnatal. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that pregnancy represents a psychological challenge regardless of care type chosen and choice of no one care option confers greater psychological benefit across the maternity experience as a whole. It is possible, however, that differences in experience or environment at critical times can affect psychological status. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Although fatigue is a common experience for pregnant women and new mothers, few measures of fatigue have been validated for use with this population. To address this gap, the authors assessed psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) scale, which was used in 2 independent samples of pregnant women. Results indicated that the psychometric properties of the scale were very similar across samples and time points. The scale possesses a high level of internal consistency, has good convergent validity with measures of sleep quality and depression, and discriminates well from a measure of social support. Contrary to previous evaluations of the MAF, data strongly suggest that the scale represents a unidimensional construct best represented by a single factor. Results indicate that the MAF is a useful measure of fatigue among pregnant and postpartum women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Exposure to hostile conditions results in a series of coordinated responses aimed at enhancing the probability of survival. The activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis plays a pivotal role in the stress response. While the short-term activation of the HPA axis allows adaptive responses to the challenge, in the long run this can be devastating for the organism. In particular, life events occurring during the perinatal period have strong long-term effects on the behavioral and neuroendocrine response to stressors. In male and female rats exposed to prenatal restraint stress (PRS), these effects include a long-lasting hyperactivation of the HPA response associated with an altered circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion. Furthermore, male animals exhibit sleep disturbances. In males, these HPA dysfunctions have been reported in infant, young, adult and aged animals, thus suggesting a permanent effect of early stress. Interestingly, after exposure to an intense inescapable footshock, female PRS rats durably exhibit a blunted corticosterone secretion response to stress. In male PRS rats exposed to an alcohol challenge, the HPA axis is similarly hyporesponsive. Rats exposed to PRS also show behavioral disturbances. Both male and female PRS rats show high anxiety levels and depression-like behavior during adulthood, although some studies suggest that female PRS rats present low anxiety levels. With ageing, male and female PRS rats exhibit memory impairments in hippocampus-dependent tasks, while female PRS rats improve their memory performance during adulthood. The gender effect on behavior seems to be related to a reduction in hippocampal plasticity in male PRS rats, and an increase in female PRS rats. Despite the permanent imprinting induced by early stress, the dysfunctions observed after PRS can be reversed by environmental or pharmacological strategies such as environmental enrichment or antidepressive and neurotrophic treatments. Mechanisms underlying the effects of PRS on the offspring remain largely unknown. However, previous studies have demonstrated that maternal glucocorticoids during pregnancy play an important role in the HPA disturbances reported in male offspring. Finally, gestational stress has long-lasting effects on the HPA axis and on behavior in the dams. Alterations in maternal behavior could thus also make a strong contribution to the long-term effects of PRS, through epigenetic mechanisms.

N2  - Aim: To analyse the importance of mothers’ smoking during pregnancy and/or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in early childhood for children’s health and well-being at the age of 3 years. Methods: Four groups from a population based cohort (n = 8850) were compared: children with nonsmoking mother during pregnancy and nonsmoking parents at the age of 3 years (n = 7091); children with only foetal exposure (n = 149); children exposed only postnatally (n = 895) and children exposed both pre- and postnatally (n = 595). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: Children exposed both pre- and postnatally had more wheezing (1.14; 1.07–1.21) and rhinitis (1.16; 1.06–1.26), used more cough-mixture (1.07 ; 1.01–1.14) and broncodilatating drugs (1.08; 1.02–1.15) and suffered more from excessive crying (1.31; 1.13–1.51) and irritability (1.27; 1.09–1.48) compared to children with nonsmoking parents. Children exposed only postnatally had more rhinitis (1.24; 1.12–1.37), used more cough-mixture (1.14; 1.05–1.29) and suffered more from poor sleep (1.26; 1.07–1.47) than children of nonsmoking parents. Children with prenatal exposure only used more broncodilatating drugs (1.45; 1.03–2.04) and suffered more from poor sleep (2.06; 1.09–3.87). Conclusion: Health differences, small but significant, indicate that prenatal and/or postnatal ETS exposure alone, or in combination, seems to interfere with child health, supporting the importance of zero tolerance. However, as most smoking parents in Sweden try to protect their children from ETS exposure, the results also might indicate that protective measures are worthwhile.

N2  - Objective: The present study was conducted to evaluate serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in newly diagnosed patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Subjects and methods: Between April 2005 and March 2006, a total of 231 consecutive adult habitual snorers underwent polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory. Ninety-seven subjects were found suitable for hs-CRP measurement after application of the following exclusion criteria: patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, congestive cardiac failure, or smoking history, patients who were pregnant, on steroid treatment, on hormone replacement therapy, or with chronic use of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral anticoagulants and lipid-lowering drugs and patients having undergone upper airway surgery. Patients were classified as apneic [apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 5], obese non-apneic [body mass index (BMI) > 25, AHI < 5] and non-obese non-apneic (BMI < 25, AHI < 5). C-reactive protein levels were measured in stored sera by high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassay (Biocheck, Inc. Foster City, CA, USA). After checking normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and using a square-root transformation, Pearson's and partial correlation coefficients were calculated for identified risk factors and confounders. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify variables that were independently associated with hs-CRP. Results: The mean serum levels of hs-CRP were found to be 0.25 ± 0.23, 0.58 ± 0.55, and 0.51 ± 0.37 mg/dl in non-obese non-apneics (n = 23), obese non-apneics (n = 45) and apneics (obese and non-obese, n = 29), respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient of hs-CRP with BMI was found to be 0.25 (p = 0.01), and with AHI 0.16 (p = 0.12). Partial correlation analysis showed that hs-CRP levels correlated significantly with BMI after adjustment for AHI and age (r = 0.22, p = 0.03), while correlation with disease severity as assessed by AHI after adjustment for BMI and age was not significant (r = 0.10, p = 0.33). After stepwise multiple linear regression, only BMI was found to be significantly associated with serum hs-CRP levels (β = 0.02, p = 0.01). Conclusions: In this first comprehensive cross-sectional study on Indian subjects, we found that obesity, and not obstructive sleep apnea, is associated with elevated serum levels of hs-CRP. No independent correlation was found between severity of OSA and hs-CRP in the present study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To examine patterns of postpartum parental sleep and levels of fatigue at 2, 12, and 20 weeks following hospital discharge of newborn twins. Design: Descriptive longitudinal pilot study. Setting: Recruitment from 2 hospital postpartum units. Data collected in parents’ homes. Participants: Eight primiparous parents caring for twins delivered at 33 to 38 weeks gestation. Methods: Home visits to deliver and retrieve study equipment: wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries to measure sleep, standardized instrument to measure fatigue, and an investigator-developed form to measure demographics and related variables. Results: Fathers had significantly less night sleep (5.4 hours) and less 24 hour sleep (5.8 hours) than mothers (6.2 and 6.9 hours, respectively) at 2 weeks after twins were discharged. Sleep efficiency increased significantly over time in a linear fashion for both parents. Morning and evening fatigue levels were not significantly different between parents and remained constant over time. Conclusion: Pilot data suggest that mothers and especially fathers of twins experience sleep disturbances after discharge of their twins. Further study is needed to more fully describe the evolution of sleep patterns and clarify factors that influence sleep in parents of twins.

N2  - This book's 13 chapters offer a step-by-step method of differential diagnosis for some of the most common sleep complaints encountered in today's professional clinical practices. After a brief overview of sleep physiology and pathology, each of the chapters addresses the symptoms, tests, and various behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for a wide range of sleep conditions. The latter chapters discuss sleep disorders in distinct patient demographics—specifically children, women (during pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause) and the increasing population of older adults. The manual also includes a variety of figures and tables throughout, as well as several helpful patient handouts. No other clinical text provides such a breadth of information in such a compact, easy-to-carry volume. By classifying sleep disorders by clinical presentation, patient demographic, and related conditions, the Clinical Manual for Evaluation and Treatment of Sleep Disorders offers clinicians and students a valuable reference tool in diagnosis and treatment.

N2  - Case: Sophia is a 3-year-old girl who was brought to her pediatrician by her parents who were concerned about inconsolable night-time awakening. Her mother indicated that she has frequent (>6), early nocturnal awakenings accompanied by screaming and crying lasting up to 1 hour since her birth. These episodes increased in intensity and frequency in the past year since the birth of her brother. With a bedtime routine (a cup of water by bedside with a washcloth and touching mother's nose, chin, and cheeks), Sophia falls asleep easily; however, within 1 hour she awakes screaming and flailing unaware of her surroundings and unable to be comforted. There are no tonic-clonic movements. Prior interventions, including a sleep coach and "letting Sophia cry it out," did not change her sleep pattern. Sophia's mother reports that she needs to be on a specific daily routine including set times for awakening, activity, snacks, naps, and meals. Diversion from the routine and separation from her mother results in a tantrum (kicking, hitting, screaming, and inconsolability) often lasting more than 30 minutes. Sophia was born after an uncomplicated 37-week gestation. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia required readmission for 24 hours of phototherapy; serum bilirubin levels were performed daily for 3 weeks after discharge. At 6 weeks, daily episodes of screaming, inconsolability, forceful vomiting, and inability to sleep led to a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. Medication trials were not successful, but the symptoms resolved by 5 months. Formula intolerance and difficulty swallowing and chewing different textures of solid food occurred in the first year. Occupational therapy was of "no benefit"; Sophia was overwhelmed by the activity and took a long time to warm up to the therapist. Her texture aversion resolved by 2 years of age. She prefers one-on-one play and has minimal interactions with other children. She has met all her developmental milestones appropriately and has no other health issues. Sophia lives with her parents and infant brother. There is a maternal family history of insomnia and sleep walking and a paternal history of sleep walking. Her mother adheres to a strict daily schedule. Sleep deprivation, different parental child-rearing practices, social isolation, and lack of quality parent time were all identified by the mother as significant marital stressors. During the office visit, Sophia required 30 minutes to warm up and smile, and over 60 minutes before she spoke her first word. Physical examination was normal (including growth measurements) and the developmental examination was age-appropriate. Upon completion of the assessment, she was engaging, playful, and cooperative with the pediatrician. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Gender plays a significant role in the development of major depression, a fact evidenced by lifetime prevalence rates as high as 21% in women compared with 12.7% in men (Kessler et al., 1994; Alonso et al., 2004). Although the diagnostic criteria for depression are the same for both sexes, women with depression more frequently experience guilt, anxiety, increased sleep, weight gain and comorbid eating disorders. In addition, women with bipolar disorder spend more symptomatic time in the depressive state compared to men with the same diagnosis (Perugi et al., 1990). The role of gender in bipolar disorder has not been studied to the same extent as has gender in other chronic mental illnesses (Leibenluft, 1996; Hendrick et al., 2000, 2003; Blehar et al., 1998; Weissman et al., 1988) but there are some specific features of bipolar disorder in women that set them apart from other patient populations. This chapter discusses bipolar disorder across the female reproductive cycle; treatment strategies for menstrual related mood changes; pregnancy and treatment strategies during pregnancy; pharmacotherapy during pregnancy and the postpartum; menopause; treatment strategies for menopausal related mood changes; and future directions.
