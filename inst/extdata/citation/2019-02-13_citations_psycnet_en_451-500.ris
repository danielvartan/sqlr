N2  - The development of the EEG during childhood takes place in a typical, but individually variable way. The period of EEG maturation lasts from the 16th Week of gestation into early adulthood and undergoes, both during wakefulness and sleep, characteristic phases with typical EEG patterns, which differ to some extent from those of mature adult EEGs. This article will provide an overview of the maturation of EEG background activity and, as far as they are known, of their normal variants in the course of childhood. In the immature EEG of the preterm infant, the EEG-patterns of conventional EEG-recordings are compared to those of amplitude-integrated EEGs. In the EEG of later childhood, typical patterns of maturation are demonstrated and the main pathologic differential diagnoses of these signs of normal brain-development are mentioned.

N2  - The prehistoric art discovered in Eurasian caves, created from 37,000 to 12,000 years ago, has fascinated and perplexed historians and scientists. These caves were uninhabited, devoted to art, the first art galleries. A psychoanalytic interpretation of these extraordinary works, this paper addresses the motives of the Paleolithic artists, the meanings of their art, and the relationship of the art and the artists to the cave. While nonanalytic formulations are considered, from a psychoanalytic perspective, the interpretation of the cave is symbolic of the womb, the birth canal, and the primal cavity of self-object relationship. Art was created in identification with pregnancy and birth; art endured as reassurance against permanent darkness and death. Entering and leaving the cave could also represent coitus but, a on a deeper level, attachment and separation. The cave had magical and developmental significance, a transitional space between internal and external, fantasy and reality, death and rebirth. The creation of art and music, and the invention of intentional, controlled fire, marked the arrival of Homo sapiens, differentiated from all preceding and parallel primates. The painted cave might also have represented a cephalic container with illuminated imagery suggestive of dreaming sleep. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Optimism is a disposition or tendency to see the more favorable side of events or conditions and to expect the most favorable outcome. Birth of a child brings joy and prosperity. Exhaustion after childbirth, stress, changes in the daily routine, and lack of sleep in the first weeks, and even months of the child's life may not be the causes, but, as today's statistics show, they add to the condition which in 10% of cases leads to the postpartum depression. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to examine the correlation between optimism, pessimism and emotional regulation and control and the postpartum depression in new mothers during the most critical period for the onset of postpartum depression of seven days to six months. Another aim is to examine the correlation between demographic characteristics (age, education level, and number of pregnancies) and the onset of postpartum depression. Results indicate that postpartum depression is in correlation with emotional regulation and control, as well as with pessimism, and in negative correlation with optimism. Another significant result based on socio-demographic variables is the correlation between postpartum depression in women and high level of professional qualifications.

N2  - While women have a higher objective sleep efficiency than do men, they paradoxically report more sleep problems. It is unclear whether the reporting gap is a descriptive difference or measurement problem. Certainly, some sleep disorders, such as insomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and hypersomnolence, are more frequent in women, whereas others, such as REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), are more prevalent in men. This chapter reviews gender-specific sleep disorders and the impact of pair-sleeping in the context of sex differences in sleep, reproductive phases, and circadian timing across the life span.

N2  - Reproductive control has been viewed as a means of empowering women, supporting the improvement of their psychological wellbeing and physical health. The papers in this edition of the journal reflect a range of associated reproductive and parenting issues. It is important to understand the processes involved when women or men make decisions regarding reproductive behavior and how the decisions made or the decision- making processes affect women’s health and self-image and also that of their partner. This is true for both wanted and unwanted pregnancy. The objectives of a number of studies published in the journal have included understanding the experiences, attitudes and decisions women make in exercising their reproductive choices in pregnancy more broadly, and the effects those decisions have on women’s health and wellbeing. The papers on parenting in this edition reflect very different aspects of early parent and infant behavior, nevertheless important ones as far as the wellbeing of both parents and children is concerned: differences interaction with mothers with serious mental health problems and the effect on mothers of having young children with sleep problems.

N2  - This paper examines racial differences in trends and predictors of prone and lateral infant sleep positioning among South Carolina mothers and infants. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data were used to analyze linear trends in prone, lateral, and supine infant sleep positioning among 14,648 mother-infant pairs from 1996 to 2007. Logistic regression models were used to examine the predictors of prone and lateral positioning among 9,015 mother-infant pairs from 2000 to 2007. From 1996 to 2007, white infants experienced a reduction in both prone and lateral positioning and an increase in supine positioning (28.2–66.7%), while black infants had smaller decreases in prone and lateral positioning and a smaller increase in supine positioning (22.6–47.1%) than white infants. Compared to births in 2000–2005, births after the explicit recommendation that infants not be placed in the lateral sleep position (2006–2007) were associated with decreased odds of lateral positioning among white infants (odds ratio [OR]: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51, 0.87) but not among black infants. The significant predictors of white infants being placed in the prone position were different from the predictors for black infants. Additionally, with regard to lateral sleep positioning, more significant predictors were observed among white infants than black infants. These findings suggest that efforts are warranted to increase the prevalence of supine sleep positioning, especially among black infants. Race-specific programs may efficiently reduce non-supine sleep positioning to help narrow racial gaps in sudden infant death syndrome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Presents a case report of a Mr Paul Harder, a 66 year-old right-handed male architect was born after an uneventful pregnancy and suffered no childhood diseases before developing epilepsy at age 7 years. Initially, seizures consisted of episodes of the right hand and arm shaking. He was treated with numerous antiepileptic drugs throughout childhood and adolescence, with a maximum interval between seizures of 2 years, aged 15 to 17, with no concurrent change in his antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Following this, however, his epilepsy remained refractory to medical treatment. Habitual seizures occurred during wake and sleep, and had always been stereotyped. Seizures consisted of an initial indescribable feeling in his head and/or moving up the right arm followed by hypermotor movements of the right arm, sometimes spreading to the right leg and the whole of the right side. The patient declined the option of intracranial EEG and surgical treatment, and seizures continued at a rate of 10e20 seizures a month following adjustment of his AEDs. FCD are localised areas of abnormal cortical organisation and/or dysplastic neurons and are increasingly recognised as a cause of medically refractory focal epilepsy as MRI technology improves, resulting in its detection.

N2  - Consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) include motor hyperactivity, disrupted sleep and cognitive deficits. Hypothalamic orexin (ORX)-synthesizing neurons are important for the maintenance of vigilance and regulation of motor activity but their hyperactivity may contribute to anxiety disorders. Using a rat model, we tested whether ORX plays a role in behavioral consequences of prenatal AE. Male rat pups received 2.625g/kg of alcohol (AE group) intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD)4–9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy. Control pups were sham-intubated (S group). On PD12–14, they received daily injections of either the ORX-1 receptor antagonist, SB-334867 (SB; 20mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (V) during the lights-off period. On PD16, they were subjected to the homing response (HR) test. On PD17, their motor activity was monitored in a novel environment. The percentage of tests in which HR acquisition was not achieved and the number of trials needed to reach the shortest HR latency were higher, whereas the percentage of successful trials was lower, in AE–V than in S–V rats (p =0.0009–0.03). In contrast, these measures were not significantly different between AE–SB and either S–SB or S–V rats. Motor activity in AE–V rats was significantly higher than in S–V (p =0.003), S–SB (p =0.007) or AE–SB (p =0.02) rats, with no difference between S–SB and AE–SB group. Our findings suggest that excessive activity of ORX neurons contributes to motor hyperactivity and impaired HR acquisition following perinatal AE and that these symptoms may be alleviated by systemic antagonism of ORX-1 receptors.

N2  - The impact of ovarian hormones on hamster ultradian rhythms (URs) is unknown. We concurrently monitored URs and circadian rhythms (CRs) of home cage locomotor activity during the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and lactation of Syrian hamsters. URs with a mean period of 4-5 h were evident during the dark phase in more than 90% of females on days 1 and 2 of the estrous cycle but were significantly less prevalent on cycle days 3 and 4. The period of the UR did not vary as a function of estrous cycle stage, but at all stages, the UR period was longer in the dark than the light phase. The UR acrophase occurred significantly earlier on cycle day 4 than on days 1 and 2, and UR robustness and amplitude were reduced on days 3 and 4. Robustness, mesor, and amplitude of CRs were greater during cycle days 3 and 4; timing of the CR acrophase was delayed on day 4 relative to all other cycle days. Effects of the estrous cycle on URs were evident only during the dark phase. The proportion of hamsters displaying dark phase URs increased significantly during early and late gestation and decreased during lactation. Pregnancy significantly increased UR complexity, robustness, and amplitude. The emergence of URs over gestation was paralleled by decrements in the robustness and amplitude of CRs, which also were absent in a significant proportion of dams during lactation but re-emerged at weaning of litters. The changing endocrine profile of the estrous cycle, hormonal dynamics of pregnancy and lactation, and nursing demands placed on dams are each associated with alterations in the expression of ultradian and circadian locomotor rhythms. Diminution of CRs and augmentation of URs may afford greater behavioral flexibility during life stages when interactions with mates and offspring are less predictable.

N2  - The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) utilized by pregnant women influence fetal neurobehavioral development. In this observational study we investigated developmental milestones of fetal behavior during the pregnancy of women with psychiatric disorders who took SSRIs throughout gestation (medicated group; n = 96) or who had discontinued medication early in gestation or before conception (unmedicated group; n = 37). Healthy unexposed fetuses of women without mental disorders comprised the control group (n = 130). Ultrasonographic observations of fetal behavior were made three times in pregnancy (T1-T3). Effects of SSRIs were studied over a wide range of dosages (low, standard, or high) and for different drug types. Fetuses exposed to standard or high SSRI dosages compared with control, unmedicated, or low-medicated fetuses showed significantly increased motor activity at the beginning (T1) and end of the second trimester (T2). They particularly exhibited disrupted emergence of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM; quiet) sleep during the third trimester, characterized by continual bodily activity and, thus, poor inhibitory motor control during this sleep state near term (T3). The SSRI effects on the fetus were dose related, but independent of SSRI type. The results demonstrate changes in fetal neurobehavioral development associated with standard and high SSRI dosages that are observable throughout gestation. A first-choice SSRI type was not apparent. Bodily activity at high rate during non-REM sleep in SSRI-exposed fetuses is an abnormal phenomenon, but its significance for postnatal development is unclear.

N2  - Objective: To examine the relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and the body composition of offspring. Subjects: Grade 4 elementary school children (n = 1366; boys/girls, 724/642; 9-10 years old) were enrolled in this study. All parents answered a lifestyle questionnaire, and children underwent passive smoking tests. Urinary cotinine measurement and lifestyle screening test parameters (that is, body weight, body length, body mass index (BMI), obesity index (OI), blood tests for liver function and lipid profile and questions regarding maternal smoking and lifestyle) were evaluated in terms of their relationship with maternal smoking. In addition, urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentration was measured in 80 randomly selected children to assess its relationship with oxidative stress. Results: Both BMI and OI were significantly higher in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy than in those whose mothers never smoked (BMI: 17.2 ± 2.7 vs 16.9 ± 2.5 kgm-2, P = 0.016; OI: 2.7 ± 14.3% vs 0.4 ± 14.0%, P = 0.003). The degree of elevation was positively correlated with the duration of maternal smoking. The increases in BMI and OI resulted from increased body weight and reduced height. The confounding factors-‘breakfast with family’, ‘watching television at dinner’, ‘eating and drinking before sleep’, ‘watching television for 42 h’, ‘sleep duration o8 h’ and ‘playing sports’-were statistically significant. BMI and OI were significantly high in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy in these six confounders. On the other hand, urinary 8-OHdG concentration was negatively correlated with BMI in children who had 41.3 ng ml-1 urinary cotinine, suggesting that it may be related to basal metabolism due to oxidative stress. Conclusion: Maternal smoking is a risk factor for higher BMI and OI in 9- to 10-year-old children whose mothers smoke during pregnancy and may be independent of other confounding factors.

N2  - Presents a case report of a 28-year-old woman. She was first seen at 17 days postpartum. There was no prior history of hypomania in the context of sleep restriction. To her knowledge, there was no family psychiatric history. She was not on any medication. She did not drink alcohol or use recreational substances. The pregnancy had been normal throughout. At 39 weeks gestational age, she went into labor. The labor lasted for 4 days during which time she was unable to sleep due to frequent and painful contractions. She was eventually admitted to hospital and the delivery was facilitated with oxytocin. A normal infant was delivered vaginally. She found herself unable to rest or sleep and busied herself with household chores, a pattern which would continue for the next 2 weeks. She started to become suspicious of her husband with whom she previously had an excellent relationship, accusing him of not loving her and fearing he was going to harm the infant. Her behavior was somewhat bizarre: she went to stay overnight in the home of a couple with whom she was not particularly close. There was no perceptual abnormality or other features of psychosis. It was felt that both her insight and judgment were reduced. The only medication prescribed during the 4-day stay was lorazepam 1 mg qhs to help sleep. She has been followed as an outpatient for 6 months and, to date, there has been no recurrence of her symptoms and her mood has remained stable.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of postpartum depression in a regular clinical setting among Chilean women. The Postpartum Depression Screening Scale, Spanish Version was used to assess symptoms of depression. Chilean women (45%) reported depressive symptoms including suicidal thoughts, sleeping/eating disturbances, and emotional stability. Factors that predicted the probability of PPD included attitudes concerning pregnancy, social support, and tobacco use. Routine screening for PPD could make a difference in prevention, prompt diagnosis, and management of postpartum depression in developing countries.

N2  - Background: The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of medical disorders (obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin/resistance/glucose intolerance) that characteristically occur together in individuals. The prevalence of MetS continues to increase in the U.S. and increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality. Little research uses a theoretical model to identify direct or indirect contributions to MetS and predictors to MetS. Identifying the factors that influence MetS in a national sample is necessary to understand targets for intervention to prevent the MetS and its sequelae. Purpose: This study tested a hypothesized conceptual model of the biopsychosocial factors associated with MetS in adults using a representative sample. Methods: A secondary data analysis was conducted using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2008 data from non-pregnant participants who were 20-80 years old and completed the questionnaire and medical examination with fasting laboratory data. The sample of 2,583 adults represented 212 million non-institutionalized civilian Americans living in the U.S. Path analysis was conducted to test the biopsychosocial model of MetS. Complex samples logistic regression models (CSLR) were utilized to examine the direct and indirect contributions of biomedical (age), biosocial (gender, race, education, income, and marital status), and psychosocial factors (depressive symptoms, diet, physical activity, smoking status, and sleep) to MetS. Results: Of the study population, 29% met the criteria for MetS and 95% had at least one component of MetS. The hypothesized model fit the nationally representative data. The parsimonious model with age, gender, race, education, income, depressive symptoms, physical activity, smoking, and the interaction between age and physical activity explained 25.2% of the variance in the presence of MetS. Mediating effects among the biosocial and psychosocial factors help explain their relationship with MetS. Conclusion: The study supported the hypothesized model and the contributions of biopsychosocial factors to MetS. The study indicated that certain demographic groups were vulnerable to MetS. More studies are needed to examine factors associated with MetS than were from the hypothesized model. Prospective studies are needed to improve psychosocial status and to prevent/reverse MetS.

N2  - Introduction: Advanced paternal age (APA) is a risk factor for nonaffective psychosis (NAP) in the offspring, although the mechanism(s) of this association are not clear. The aim of this study was to examine whether later childbearing can be explained by parental schizophrenia, and in doing so, further evaluate the “de novo mutation” hypothesis for the association between APA and NAP. Methods: Using binary logistic regression, the association between APA and parental history of schizophrenia in the offspring, considering maternal and paternal history separately, was examined in 1) all persons with NAP born in Finland between 1950 and 1969 (Finnish NAP Cohort, n = 13,712), and 2) members of the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC 1966, n = 10,224), a general population birth cohort. Results: In the Finnish NAP Cohort, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA (Odds Ratio [OR] for linear trend = 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.12–1.29, p < 0.01). In the NFBC 1966 sample, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA at the trend level (OR = 1.14, 0.99–1.31, p = 0.07). By contrast, there was no association between having a father with schizophrenia and APA. Discussion: In both a general population cohort and a birth cohort of subjects with nonaffective psychosis, APA was associated with maternal, but not paternal, schizophrenia. These findings suggest that increased genetic risk from the mother may explain the association between APA and nonaffective psychosis, and argue against the “de novo mutation” hypothesis.

N2  - Objective: Connexin hemichannels can open during ischemia, resulting in loss of membrane potential, calcium influx, and release of glutamate. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that opening of hemichannels after cerebral ischemia may contribute to delayed evolution of injury. Methods: We infused a mimetic peptide that blocks connexin 43 hemichannels into the lateral ventricle of chronically instrumented fetal sheep in utero at 128 ± 1 days gestation (term is 147 days), starting 90 minutes after 30 minutes of severe ischemia induced by reversible bilateral carotid artery occlusion, for either 1 or 25 hours. Sheep were killed 7 days later. Results: Peptide infusion was associated with a graded improvement in recovery of electroencephalographic power after 7 days recovery, from −13 ± 1.9dB (n = 7) after ischemia–vehicle to −9 ± 1.6dB (n = 7) after ischemia–short infusion and −5 ± 1.6dB after ischemia–long infusion (n = 6, p p p p p p < 0.05 vs sham control). Interpretation: These data support the hypothesis that opening of connexin hemichannels is a significant mediator of postischemic white and gray matter dysfunction and injury.

N2  - Fetal sleep states emerge during the third trimester of pregnancy and involve multiple interconnected neuronal networks. We examined whether fetal sleep characteristics predict child and adolescent self-regulation in a non-clinical sample (study group, n = 25; reference group, n = 48). Combined recordings of three sleep variables (fetal heart rate, body movements and rapid eye movements) were made for 2 h at 36–38 weeks’ gestation. Fetuses showing synchronous change of sleep variables (i.e. within 3 min) at transition from quiet into active sleep reached a higher level of effortful control, both at 8–9 and 14–15 years, than fetuses not making synchronous transitions and compared with the reference group. Results are discussed from a Developmental Origins of Behavior, Health and Disease (DOBHaD) point of view. It is concluded that studying sleep ontogeny offers the possibility to gain insight into brain maturational processes and/or environmental adaptive processes that may have long term behavioral developmental consequences.

N2  - Background: Sleep disturbance is a significant health issue in pregnant women. Although previous studies contribute to an understanding of the multifactorial nature of pregnancy-related sleep disturbance, objective measures of sleep were not included, and so data may be subject to recall and potential participant self-report bias. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors associated with poor sleep quality in women during their third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: This prospective study included 30 nulliparous women who wore a wrist actigraph to objectively monitor sleep for 7 consecutive days and completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: Fifteen women (50%) had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score of >5, indicating poor sleep quality. Mean actigraphic sleep efficiency was only 80.05% ± 6.27%. There were significant differences (p < .01) in sleep offset time and total nocturnal sleep time between weekdays and weekends. Later sleep onset time was associated with poorer sleep, including longer sleep latency, and reduced total nocturnal sleep time and sleep efficiency. Discussion: Nulliparous women experience both objective and subjective sleep disturbances, and their sleep patterns differ between weekdays and weekends during their third trimester of pregnancy. Results suggest that maternal sleep pattern may be improved by maintaining a regular and earlier bedtime so women have more opportunity to obtain sufficient nocturnal sleep and improved sleep quality.

N2  - A long-standing critique of adolescent employment is that it engenders a precocious maturity of more adult-like roles and behaviors, including school disengagement, substance use, sexual activity, inadequate sleep and exercise, and work-related stress. Though negative effects of high-intensity work on adolescent adjustment have been found, little research has addressed whether such work experiences are associated with precocious family formation behaviors in adolescence, such as sexual intercourse, pregnancy, residential independence, and union formation. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find that teenagers who spend long hours on the job during the school year are more likely to experience these family formation behaviors earlier than youth who work moderately or not at all.

N2  - Objective: Coffee and other caffeinated beverages are commonly consumed in pregnancy. In adults, caffeine may interfere with sleep onset and have a dose-response effect similar to those seen during insomnia. In infancy, nighttime waking is a common event. With this study, we aimed to investigate if maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy and lactation leads to frequent nocturnal awakening among infants at 3 months of age. Methods: All children born in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, during 2004 were enrolled on a cohort study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and after 3 months to obtain information on caffeine drinking consumption, sociodemographic, reproductive, and behavioral characteristics. Infant sleeping pattern in the previous 15 days was obtained from a subsample. Night waking was defined as an episode of infant arousal that woke the parents during nighttime. Multivariable analysis was performed by using Poisson regression. Results: The subsample included 885 of the 4231 infants born in 2004. All but 1 mother consumed caffeine in pregnancy. Nearly 20% were heavy consumers (≥300 mg/day) during pregnancy and 14.3% at 3 months postpartum. Prevalence of frequent nighttime awakeners (>3 episodes per night) was 13.8% (95% confidence interval: 11.5%–16.0%). The highest prevalence ratio was observed among breastfed infants from mothers consuming ≥300 mg/day during the whole pregnancy and in the postpartum period (1.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.86–3.17) but at a nonsignificant level. Conclusions: Caffeine consumption during pregnancy and by nursing mothers seems not to have consequences on sleep of infants at the age of 3 months.

Chronically catheterized fetal sheep were made moderately or severely hypoxic by placental embolization for 15 days starting at gestational age 116–118 (term ∼147 days). Cross-sections of the aorta were analysed for collagen and elastin content using histological procedures, while immunofluorescence was applied to measure markers of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) type. In frozen aortae quantitative PCR was used to measure mRNA levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) precursor proteins as well as molecular regulators of developmental and pathological remodelling. Relative to Control (n = 6), aortic wall thickness was increased by 23% in the Moderate group (n = 5) and 33% (P n = 5). Relative to Control, the Severe group exhibited a 5-fold increase in total collagen content (P P P P P P P P P P in utero mediated by molecular regulators of arterial growth occurs in response to chronic hypoxaemia.

N2  - Background: Sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression are common during pregnancy. Both are independent and interrelated risk factors for adverse outcomes. It is unclear the degree to which sleep differs between depressed and nondepressed pregnant women. We sought to (1) describe and compare sleep disturbances in depressed pregnant and nondepressed pregnant women, (2) determine the impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) treatment on sleep, and (3) evaluate whether sleep at 20 weeks is associated with increased depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder (MDD) in later pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 240) were recruited in the second trimester (20 weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N = 59) and nondepressed (N = 181) groups based on a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement was administered at 20, 30, and 36 weeks gestation from which the sleep variables were obtained. Results: Depressed women had more fragmented sleep at each assessment (P values ≤.05). However, the frequency of insomnia symptoms was greater for depressed women only at 20 weeks gestation. SSRI use, regardless of MDD status, did significantly affect several sleep variables. Among the nondepressed women, those with short or longer sleep duration, symptoms of insomnia and long periods of nocturnal waketime had higher Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement scores later in pregnancy (P values ≤.05). Conclusions: At 20 and 30 weeks gestation sleep was more disturbed in depressed pregnant women compared to nondepressed pregnant women. At 36 weeks, sleep was disturbed regardless of depression status or SSRI use. Among the nondepressed women, disturbed sleep in conjunction with SSRI use was associated with higher depressive symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause several cognitive and behavioral difficulties. Few studies have investigated the associations with infant temperament or sleeping patterns. Our aim was to study potential associations between early prenatal binge exposure and infant temperament and sleeping pattern. Methods: In a population based longitudinal study, representative of pregnant women in Oslo, questionnaires were answered at 17 and 30 weeks of pregnancy and 6 months after term. Two factors, difficult temperament and sleeping problems, were identified using Principal Component Analysis and dichotomized at the least optimal 14–15%. Logistic regression analyses identified predictive factors. Results: Maternal binge drinking (≥ 5 drinks per occasion) once a week during pregnancy week 0–6 significantly predicted both difficult temperament (Odds Ratio OR 3.3**; 95% Confidence interval CI 1.4–7.9) and sleeping problems (OR 5.3**; 95% CI 2.1–13.7) in the infant, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Including binge drinking more often than once a week, further increased the OR of sleeping problems (6.0***; 2.7–13.7). Prenatal maternal depressive symptoms also predicted both outcomes. Reduced birth weight predicted difficult temperament. Maternal satisfaction with life reduced the probability of sleeping problems. Maternal smoking, and work stress, during pregnancy had no predictive power. The results were not explained by binge drinking later during pregnancy or higher consumption per occasion. Conclusions: Binge drinking once a week during pregnancy week 0–6 had stronger predictive power of difficult temperament and sleeping problems during infancy, than other covariates. The findings support advising women to avoid binge drinking when planning pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The two studies presented here describe neonatal breastfeeding as a measure of neonatal processing. The first paper describes the theoretical framework which guides both studies, the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing. The first paper also reviews the state of the science for the measurement of neonatal processing, neonatal neurobehavioral organization (NNBO). The second paper is the first study to describe breastfeeding behaviors, a measure of NNBO, of children later diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The first study describes the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing theoretical framework, reviews the science of NNBO biobehavioral measures, and provides a short summary of a descriptive study using breastfeeding as an NNBO measure. The Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing uses three concepts, a neonate, the environment (maternal factors) and the neonatal mental system. Neonatal processing occurs within the neonatal mental system. The mental system may be assessed by NNBO biobehaviors, specifically breastfeeding. Breastfeeding and other NNBO biobehavioral measures of sleep/wake states, vagal tone and heart rate variability, neurophysiological measures of eventrelated potential of brain activity, and nutritive sucking and sucking patterns of bottle feeding literature is reviewed. NNBO biobehavioral measures have been found to be predictive of developmental outcomes. Breastfeeding, however, as an NNBO biobehavioral measure, has limited research as a predictive measure for cognitive and social outcomes. A short summary describes maternal breastfeeding experiences of mothers of children later diagnosed with ASD using the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing as a guide. Mothers described their breastfeeding experiences and their neonate's breastfeeding behaviors. Many of the neonates' breastfeeding behaviors were described as demonstrating an atypical breastfeeding pattern, “insatiable feeding”, which may reflect early alteration in processing. The second paper applies the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing in a retrospective study. The study describes the maternal breastfeeding experiences during the first month after delivery of mothers who breastfed children later diagnosed with ASD. Mothers were interviewed in their homes, offices, libraries, at local shopping malls and restaurants. The interview used three measures created from the three major concepts within the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing: a maternal socio-environmental questionnaire, a semi-structured interview, and a post-interview summary. Participants were a convenience sample of 20 mothers (13 primiparas, 7 multiparas). Maternal age range was 28–60 years of age (M = 43.3, SD = 9.6). Two mothers had more than one son diagnosed with ASD. One mother had two sons and the second mother had three sons diagnosed with ASD for a total sample of 23 breastfed neonates. All 23 children had been full term neonates (38–42 weeks gestation) with birth weight > 2500 grams, diagnosed with ASD between ages of 18 months to 11 years of age (M = 4.3, SD = 2.4) and age range at the time of the maternal interview was 5–35 years of age (M = 11.5,  SD = 7.6). Mothers described three types of breastfeeding experiences affected by the maternal environmental factor of professional support. One mother's experience overlapped between the first and second group. The first group (n=4) recalled breastfeeding success with no or limited professional support. The second group (n = 11) breastfed successfully after receiving positive professional support (one mother overlapped with group one), and the third group (n = 6) had variable success with breastfeeding after receiving unfavorable professional support. Support provided to the second and third groups was given for inexperience, anatomical barriers and neo… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The current study explores how child trauma therapists who are also parents experience both of their roles. While many therapists have written case studies about their pregnancies, with a few commenting on later parenthood, this phenomenon has not been examined more systematically. Few focus on clinical work with children or traumatized children. Others examine therapist-parenthood from the outside, focusing on therapists' children and partners, but not the experiences of the therapists. Better studied are the effects of vicarious and secondary traumatization, though little research speaks to potential differences from adult therapy in work with traumatized children. Despite indications that there is overlap between countertransference, vicarious and secondary trauma, parenthood, and child trauma, no researchers have explored this. Psychological phenomenology was used to examine these areas of overlap in the lives of 11 child trauma therapists, exploring the challenges and benefits brought about by the dual roles of parent and therapist. The results indicate that not only do the roles of child trauma therapist and parent inform one another, but they also provide benefits such as a greater understanding of development and the needs of children, increased compassion and empathy for clients and their parents, appreciation for one's own children, and a better understanding of parenthood. Challenges include an increase in negative countertransference with clients' parents. Another issue was the concern that one's psychological insights and knowledge unduly affect the parent-child relationship. Further, experiences of secondary, though not vicarious, traumatization were reported, including symptoms of fear, anxiety, mistrust, vigilance, nightmares, avoidance, sleep and appetite disturbances, and fatigue. Participants also described feeling more protective of their own children in relation to their clinical work. The interaction between parenthood and being a child trauma therapist is an important one to consider in terms of self-care and supervision. Future research in this area might focus on the experiences of secondary and vicarious traumatization in child trauma therapists and therapist-parents as well.

N2  - Background: In this prospective longitudinal study, we investigated the relation between sleeping arrangements and infant cortisol reactivity to stressors in the first two post-natal months. Co-sleeping, as compared to solitary sleeping, is hypothesized to provide more parental external stress regulation by night, thus reducing general stress sensitivity. We therefore expected lower cortisol reactivity to stress in infants who co-slept more regularly. Methods: Participants were 163 mothers and infants from uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies. Mothers completed daily diaries on sleeping arrangements in the first 7 weeks of life. Co-sleeping was defined as sleeping in the parents’ bedroom (i.e. own or parents’ bed). Cortisol reactivity was measured twice: to a mild physical stressor (bathing session) at 5 weeks of age and to a mild pain stressor (vaccination) at 2 months of age. Results: Infants with a solitary sleeping arrangement in their first month of life showed a heightened cortisol response to the bathing session at 5 weeks compared to infants that co-slept regularly. This effect was not explained by breastfeeding practices, maternal caregiving behavior, or infants’ night waking and sleep duration. No effects were found of co-sleeping on the cortisol response to the vaccination at 2 months. Conclusions: The results suggest that solitary sleeping in the first month of life is associated with heightened sensitivity of the HPA-axis to a mild stressor, possibly due to less nocturnal parental availability as external stress regulator. Whether this effect continues in later life, remains to be investigated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This article provides a qualitative, non-medical analysis of pregnancy bed rest to contribute to feminist scholarship on women’s experiences of embodiment and reproduction. Drawing on surveys and interviews, I examine pregnancy bed rest from the perspective of those who have experienced it. I argue that pregnancy bed rest significantly disrupts women’s sense of control over their bodies, and that this disruption is partly manifested through feelings of failure and self-blame. Women’s feelings of failure are heightened within a cultural context that emphasizes the importance of individual control over reproductive processes and ignores marginalized experiences of pregnancy. I then examine how women strategize ways to momentarily regain some control over their self and lives and thereby reduce feelings of failure. Analysis of women’s pregnancy bed rest experiences furthers our understanding of an experience that drastically alters women’s sense of control and self-discipline as well as their relationship to their bodies. It also sheds light on pregnancy as an experience that is informed at least as much by the cultural context as it is by the body. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Maternal treatment with synthetic corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (DEX) significantly reduces neonatal morbidity and mortality, but its effects on the fetal brain remain unclear. In this study we evaluated the effects of DEX on EEG activity in preterm fetal sheep. Ewes at 103 days gestation received two intramuscular injections of DEX (12 mg, n = 8) or saline vehicle (n = 7) 24 h apart. Fetal EEG activity was recorded from 6 h before until 120 h after the first injection (DEX-1). DEX-1 was associated with a marked transient rise in total EEG power, maximal at 12 h (P P vs. controls (P P < 0.001). No histological neural injury or microglial activation was seen. In summary, exposure to maternal dexamethasone was associated with dramatic, evolving low-frequency hyperactivity on fetal cortical EEG recordings, followed by sustained changes consistent with maturation of fetal sleep architecture. We postulate that these effects may contribute to improved neonatal outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The cardiovascular structure is temporally organized in both health and disease. The link between obesity and hypertension is elevated sympathetic nervous system activity and hormonal activity which present a clear rhythmicity, with the pineal, corticosteroid and leptin systems being those most implicated. Also, genetic mutations or deletions have implicated peripheral clock genes in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, lipid synthesis and adipogenesis, which are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. As hypertension and obesity are related, and the treatments of these disorders are well established but sometimes ineffective, this review focuses on chronobiological contributions to decrease the burden of hypertension and obesity in low- and middle-income groups of individuals. MEDLINE, Pubmed and SUM Search sites (2001–2011) were used in the search strategy, together with the keywords: "antihypertensive drugs"; "arterial hypertension"; "circadian rhythms"; "obesity"; and "sleep quality". Eighty-six articles were found and 50 articles from these were selected. A link between the circadian clock and hypertension has recently been described in animal models, using Clock-mutant mice that display metabolic syndrome. Experimental evidence clearly implicates circadian rhythms in the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of the blood pressure (BP) rhythm. Most clinical studies of BP focus on some pathological situation, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, sleep disorders, obesity, diabetes or pregnancy with blood biomarker alterations. However, epidemiological evidence for the role of circadian rhythms in hypertension has been lacking until recently. In Brazil, in an epidemiological, cross-sectional study, changed sleep quality and an earlier phase of mid-sleep were found in those using antihypertensive drugs. Moreover, some pharmacological studies support a circadian- and dose-dependent relationship in the use of antihypertensive drugs for the 24-h control of BP. In low- and middle-income areas, cost-effectiveness of any intervention is fundamental to the implementation of any kind of public-health policy. Therefore, improvements in diagnosis, effectiveness and implementing prevention measures to control the risk of disease are all necessary, and there is evidence that chronobiology has an important role to play. Consequently, it is important to provide guidelines to monitor BP to reduce cardiovascular risk that include chronobiological aspects of the problem.

N2  - Not using the infant back sleep position is an established risk factor for sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). Infant bed sharing may also increase SUID risk, particularly under certain circumstances. Both of these infant sleeping behaviors are disproportionately higher among Black mothers. We explored the relationship between not using the infant back sleeping and infant bed sharing, developed separate risk factor profiles for these behaviors, and identified maternal characteristics contributing to racial differences in their practice. Merged 2004–2005 birth certificate and Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data for 2,791 non-Hispanic Black and White Florida women were evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses to develop risk factor profiles for infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing. Cross-product interaction terms were introduced to identify factors contributing to racial differences. Infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing were reported by two-thirds of Black women and one-third of White women. There was no association between the infant sleeping behaviors when adjusted for race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83–1.31). The infant sleeping behaviors shared no common independent maternal characteristics. Father acknowledgement on the birth certificate was a strong contributor to racial differences in infrequent back sleeping while breastfeeding, trimester of entry to prenatal care, and maternal depression revealed notable racial differences for bed sharing. Behavior-specific and race-specific public health messages may be an important public health strategy for reducing risky infant sleeping behaviors and decreasing SUIDs.

N2  - Background: Treatment of schizophrenia frequently includes prolonged benzodiazepine administration despite a lack of evidence of its use. It is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines because of the development of dependence. We aim to assess if melatonin can facilitate the withdrawal of prolonged benzodiazepine administration in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the association of benzodiazepine dose reduction with the following clinically important variables: sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life. Methods/Design: Randomized, blinded, two-armed, parallel superiority trial. We plan to include 80 consenting outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 18-55 years of age, treated with antipsychotic drug(s) and at least one benzodiazepine derivative for the last three months before inclusion. Exclusion criteria: currently under treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, aggressive or violent behavior, known mental retardation, pervasive developmental disorder, dementia, epilepsy, terminal illness, severe co morbidity, inability to understand Danish, allergy to melatonin, lactose, starch, gelatin, or talc, hepatic impairment, pregnancy or nursing, or lack of informed consent. After being randomized to prolonged-release melatonin (Circadin®) 2 mg daily or matching placebo, participants are required to slowly taper off their benzodiazepine dose. The primary outcome measure is benzodiazepine dose at 6 months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include sleep, psychophysiological, and neurocognitive measures. Data are collected at baseline and at 6 months follow-up regarding medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, sleep, laboratory tests, adverse events, psychopathology, social function, and quality of life. Data on medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, adverse events, social function, and quality of life are also collected at 2 and 4 months follow-up. Discussion: The results from this trial will examine whether melatonin has a role in withdrawing long-term benzodiazepine administration in schizophrenia patients. This group of patients is difficult to treat and therefore often subject to polypharmacy which may play a role in the reduced life expectancy of patients compared to the background population. The results will also provide new information on the association of chronic benzodiazepine treatment with sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life. Knowledge of these important clinical aspects is lacking in this group of patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Long before I knew I had a personality disorder, I simply knew that my life felt unbearably difficult to live. For me, life has always been an uphill struggle, and at times I have just let myself tumble down the hill I have strived so hard to climb. Fortunately, I now understand how to keep going, and even to avoid falling down in the first place, but this learning process has taken the entire twenty-eight years of my life, and I still feel I have a long way to go. It feels very difficult to describe the early years of my life. To me, it was like being stuck in a cage, gigged. Throughout my childhood, it was extremely difficult to relate to other children. School was a terrifying place. My dad told me repeatedly in 'oracles' that I was different to other children: 'chosen' like him. At home, my father praised me over my brother, because he was more rebellious and outspoken, and less academically successful. My relationships with men have been the aspect of my life that has caused me the most pain. I felt, and still feel sometimes, a deep mistrust for and anger toward them. And yet I feel I desperately need their love and attention, even if I have to be manipulative or forceful to get it. When I was thirteen, I was raped by a boy I knew. My deep hatred toward my body began the night I was raped. This began to play itself out in my cutting. Soon I started going out with a boy who had a similarly apathetic attitude toward school. He was the first boy who genuinely seemed to have feelings for me beyond just wanting to sleep with me. We spent all our time together, got engaged within two weeks, and within two months, at the age of fifteen, I was pregnant. As a fifteen-year-old single mother, I rapidly lost my friendship group from school. I overdosed on anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medication several times. The trigger was frequently feeling rejected by my boyfriend. This was often an overreaction to a minor event. The repeated hostile treatment I received from nurses in hospital did not prevent me from self-harming. But somehow, when I came to the end of my A-levels, I found the strength to stop taking overdoses, although I continued to cut for several years. At university, I had the chance to gain some perspective on my life and my behavior as I was far away from what had become my home. I saw several psychotherapists and counselors, and in a new setting felt more open to trying their suggestions and thinking about alternative perspectives. Although I found cognitive-behavioral therapy very helpful, as well as meditation and mindfulness techniques, only one counselor was actually honest enough with me to say that I had Borderline Personality Disorder. In my adult life, I have struggled a great deal with a sense of identity confusion, and an unsettling feeling that I may not be doing the right job or on the right course. Being a member of this Therapeutic Community really helped me to break down my social anxieties and recognize the ways in which my behavior and decisions affect those around me and ultimately what happens in my life. I now work part time in a shop and run my own graphic design business from home! I feel I can enjoy life much more than before I went into therapy, as I've worked through many of the difficult feelings I've been carrying around since childhood. Unfortunately, my relationships with men still feel chaotic and painful. My current goals are to work toward getting a higher paid job in which I feel more comfortable, and to achieve a greater sense of stability and peace in my relationships with men. I accept that my problems are not going to disappear and that recovery is a lifelong process, but I no longer feel despair about this. I have hope for each new day.

N2  - Some infants show a free-running rhythm in their rest-activity. We do not know why, nor do we know exactly what the entrainment factors are for the development of the normal 24-h rest-activity rhythm. Actigraphic recordings on 10 primiparae during late pregnancy and these mothers and their infants during the 2nd, 6th, and 12th wks after birth were made over 3–5 continuous days to investigate maternal and infant entrainment. One infant showed a free-running rest-activity circadian rhythm. In late pregnancy, the period in the autocorrelogram of the mother with the free-running infant was longer than the significant period of the mean autocorrelogram of the mothers with nonfree-running infants. The finding of this study indicates the free-running rhythm of infant is not reset by maternal entrainment factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Statement of problem: Few studies have examined the influence of physical activity on sleep among pregnant women. To examine the potential sleep-enhancing benefits of physical activity among pregnant women and to therefore see if physical activity may serve as a non-pharmacological treatment for sleep disturbances during pregnancy, this study’s purpose was to examine the association between objectively-measured physical activity and sleep among a nationally representative sample of U.S. pregnant women. Methods: Data from the National Health and Examination Survey 2005-2006 was used for the present study. 138 pregnant women who had worn an ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer on the right hip for at least 4 days for a minimum of 10 h per day were identified. Questions on sleep were asked during the household interview. Results: Of the 22 sleeping-related parameters assessed, physical activity was only associated with two. After controlling for depression, gestation, income and parity, for every 1-min increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, pregnant women were 17% less likely to have difficulty finishing a meal because of being tired or sleepy (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.98-1.38, p = 0.06). Conclusion: Our data suggests a weak relationship between objectively-measured physical activity and sleep. Additional research using a larger sample of pregnant women, as well as experimental studies, are needed to determine the extent to which physical activity may assist in improving sleeping-related parameters among pregnant women.

N2  - The primary purpose of this study was to examine pathways from prenatal cigarette exposure to physiological regulation at 2 months of age. Specifically, we explored the possibility that any association between prenatal cigarette exposure and infant physiological regulation was moderated by fetal growth, prenatal or postnatal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure or maternal depressive symptomatology during pregnancy. We evaluated whether exposed infants who were also exposed to ETS after birth, were small for gestational age (SGA) or had mothers with higher depressive symptoms during pregnancy had the highest levels of physiological dysregulation. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was obtained from 234 (166 exposed and 68 nonexposed) infants during sleep. As expected, cigarette-exposed infants had significantly lower RSA than nonexposed infants. This association was not moderated by prenatal or postnatal ETS exposure, or maternal depressive symptomatology during pregnancy. However, small for gestational age status did moderate this association such that nonexposed infants who were not small for gestational age had a significantly higher RSA than nonexposed small for gestational age infants and exposed infants. These findings provide additional evidence that prenatal cigarette exposure is directly associated with dysregulation during infancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: To identify and characterize the trajectories of depressive and fatigue symptoms and determine the relationship between these two trajectories and associated predictors. Design: A prospective, follow-up study. Setting: A teaching medical center in central Taiwan. Participants: A convenience sample of 121 low-risk, childbearing women. Methods: Depressive and fatigue symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Fatigue Continuum Form respectively during the third trimester (time 1), one day postpartum (time 2), three days postpartum (time 3), and one week postpartum (time 4). Participants also completed structured questionnaires on demographic features, health status, and sleep quality. Results: The mean age of participants was 31.2 years. We observed four distinctive trajectories of depressive symptoms and three trajectories of fatigue using group-based trajectory modeling. A frequent cooccurrence of similar levels of these symptoms was found; that is, mothers in the high-risk depressive symptoms group were most likely to fall into the high-risk group for fatigue. Joint trajectories were predicted by poor sleep score (odds ratio = 2.96, 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 7.3) using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: Overlapping but distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms and fatigue were found. These results suggest that differentiation between depressive symptoms and fatigue is possible and important for improving care during the early postpartum period.

N2  - Objectives: To determine whether snoring, sleep position, and other sleep practices in pregnant women are associated with risk of late stillbirth. Design: Prospective population based case-control study. Setting: Auckland, New Zealand. Participants: Cases: 155 women with a singleton late stillbirth (≥28 weeks’ gestation) without congenital abnormality born between July 2006 and June 2009 and booked to deliver in Auckland. Controls: 310 women with single ongoing pregnancies and gestation matched to that at which the stillbirth occurred. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for known confounding factors. Main outcome measure: Maternal snoring, daytime sleepiness (measured with the Epworth sleepiness scale), and sleep position at the time of going to sleep and on waking (left side, right side, back, and other). Results: The prevalence of late stillbirth in this study was 3.09/1000 births. No relation was found between snoring or daytime sleepiness and risk of late stillbirth. However, women who slept on their back or on their right side on the previous night (before stillbirth or interview) were more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared with women who slept on their left side (adjusted odds ratio for back sleeping 2.54 (95% CI 1.04 to 6.18), and for right side sleeping 1.74 (0.98 to 3.01)). The absolute risk of late stillbirth for women who went to sleep on their left was 1.96/1000 and was 3.93/1000 for women who did not go to sleep on their left. Women who got up to go to the toilet once or less on the last night were more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared with women who got up more frequently (adjusted odds ratio 2.28 (1.40 to 3.71)). Women who regularly slept during the day in the previous month were also more likely to experience a late stillbirth than those who did not (2.04 (1.26 to 3.27)). Conclusions: This is the first study to report maternal sleep related practices as risk factors for stillbirth, and these findings require urgent confirmation in further studies.

N2  - This was a prospective, cohort study in Korean pregnant and postpartum women, to estimate the prevalence and patterns of sleep disturbances. The survey was composed of the following validated sleep questionnaires: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Women’s Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, Berlin Questionnaire for sleep disordered breathing, the international restless leg syndrome (IRLS) Study Group criteria, and the Johns Hopkins Telephone Diagnostic Interview Form (JHTDIF) for RLS. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0. Six hundred eighty-nine women completed sleep surveys. The overall percentage of women with very poor sleep quality (a PSQI score greater than 10), clinically significant insomnia (a total score of 9 or more), excessive daytime sleepiness (a total ESS score of 10 or more), short sleep duration (less than 7 hours per night) were 80.7%, 50.5%, 34.0% and 29.5%, respectively, and all of three parameters became increased as pregnancy progressed and after delivery ( p = 0.002, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively). The overall positive rates in Berlin and RLS questionnaires were 25.4% and 19.4%. In conclusion, sleep disturbances are prevalent among Korean pregnant and postpartum women, and increase significantly as pregnancy progresses and after delivery.

N2  - Objectives: To examine the association among nighttime sleep and daytime napping behaviors, depressive symptoms, and perception of fatigue in pregnant women. Design: A prospective descriptive study with within-subject design. Setting: A university-affiliated hospital and participants’ home environments. Participants: Thirty-eight third trimester nulliparous women completed sleep and depressive symptom questionnaires, wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 consecutive days, and kept a concurrent diary reporting naps and rating their level of fatigue using a 0-10 visual analogue scale each morning, midday, afternoon, and evening. A generalized estimating equation regression model was applied to evaluate the time-dependent association. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Mean duration of total nighttime sleep by actigraphy was 386.3 ± 60.7 min, with 11 (28.9%) women having an average total nighttime sleep3 days, and only 2 women did not nap over the entire week. Antecedent night sleep duration had a significant inverse association with morning (P = 0.022) and afternoon fatigue (P = 0.009) of the subsequent day. Self-reported naps were significantly associated with midday fatigue (P = 0.003). More depressive symptoms predicted more severe fatigue throughout the day. Conclusions: Results suggest that interventions designed to increase sleep duration and decrease depressive symptoms have the potential to prevent, ameliorate, or reduce fatigue in pregnant women. Depressive symptoms during pregnancy likely share some psychological and behavioral tendencies with fatigue and/or sleep disturbance which may complicate the evaluation of intervention effect.

N2  - Objective: To assess the association of multiple sclerosis (MS) with concurrent restless legs syndrome(RLS) and daytime sleepiness. We also prospectively examined whether women with MS had an increased risk of developing RLS during 4 years of follow-up. Methods: The main analysis was based on a cross-sectional study of 65, 544 women (aged 41 = 58 years) free of diabetes, arthritis, and pregnancy, who were participating in the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort. Participants were considered to have RLS if they met 4 RLS diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group and had restless legs ≥5 times/month. MS was self-reported and confirmed by medical record review. Results: Among women with MS, the prevalence of RLS and severe RLS (15+ times/month) were 15.5% and 9.9% in 2005, respectively, relative to 6.4% and 2.6% among women without MS. After adjustment for potential confounders and the presence of other sleep disorders, women with MS had a higher likelihood of having RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.72, 95% confidence interval[CI] 1.89-3.93), severe RLS (OR = 4.12, 95% CI 2.65 = 6.42), and daily daytime sleepiness(OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.31-3.42) compared with women without MS. Among the 172 women who had MS and were free of RLS in 2005, 9 developed RLS (5.2%) during a 4-year period and all had severe RLS. The adjusted relative risk of severe RLS was 3.58 (95% CI 1.53- 8.35), comparing women with MS at baseline with those without MS. Conclusion: Women with MS had a significantly higher prevalence of RLS and daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of developing RLS in the future (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: The applicability of the symptom criteria for diagnostic mood and anxiety disorders has in recent times been questioned for women in the perinatal period, due to the overlap of diagnostic symptoms with normal symptoms due to the physical changes of pregnancy or postpartum, (e.g., sleep difficulties). Method: 118 women in their second or early third trimester of pregnancy participated in a telephone interview that included the depression and anxiety modules of the MINI diagnostic interview, and an attributional probe question asking the woman whether endorsement of a symptom was due to the physical changes of her pregnancy or due to her mood or worries. Results: 66% of pregnant women who met criteria for major depression reported that a sufficient number of their symptoms were due to the normal physical changes of their pregnancy, such that they would no longer meet criteria for a diagnosis of major depression. Attributional probing resulted in the rate of major depression falling from 6.8% to 1.7%. The impact on anxiety disorders appears to be less. Limitations: An important issue is whether women's attributional perceptions are valid, though the face validity of some of their responses means that credence should be given to the findings. In addition, it would be useful from a validity perspective to undertake the same attributional probing with other populations where symptom presence is most likely due to mood, such as unemployed or recently separated adults without physical complaints. Conclusion: Rates of depressive disorders in pregnancy, using DSM symptom criteria, are significantly over-estimated due to the natural occurrence of many of the symptoms as a result of the pregnancy. Rates of anxiety disorders are also inflated, but to a lesser degree. This means that the validation of self-report mood measures, typically done against DSM diagnoses, is likely to have produced erroneous findings (e.g., optimum cut-off scores). It is probable that a similar finding would be obtained for the postpartum period. Thus future use of DSM symptom criteria for depression and anxiety in perinatal mental health work should use some form of attributional probing question to more accurately understand the applicability of symptoms to a diagnosis in this population.

N2  - The influence of circadian timekeeping systems on behavior and physiology can change substantially as female mammals undergo the transition from a nonpregnant to a pregnant state. Here, we examined the possibility that site-specific changes in extra-SCN oscillators and in local rhythms might coincide with the emergence of new patterns of temporal organization among various behavioral and physiological rhythms. Specifically, we compared daily patterns of immunoreactive FOS and PER2 in 3 brain regions of pregnant and diestrous rats. We found that, in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BnST-ov), the peak of the PER2 rhythm occurred approximately 12 hours out of phase in pregnant and diestrous females. In contrast, the phase of the rhythm in FOS was the same, but pregnant rats expressed more FOS in the BnST-ov than diestrous ones. In the central amygdala (CEA) of diestrous females, PER2 expression was arrhythmic, but Fos expression was elevated at night. No rhythms were seen in this region of pregnant females, nor were any rhythms seen in the basolateral amygdala of either group. Overall, the patterns in the BnST-ov and the CEA were consistent with the hypothesis that differential changes in daily rhythms within some extra-SCN brain regions might mediate the changes in the temporal organization of several behavioral and endocrine functions that occur during the transition from a nonpregnant to a pregnant state.

N2  - Aim: There is uncertainty about the best method of withdrawing supplemental oxygen in babies with chronic neonatal lung disease (CNLD). Some authors advocate withdrawal of oxygen in the day, but continuing supplementation during sleep, based on early work suggesting that oxygen saturations are lower during sleep, which did not accord with our clinical impression. We re-examined the hypothesis that babies have lower saturations while asleep. Methods: We studied infants with CNLD during the day, while awake and asleep. We recorded video with simultaneous real-time capture of oxygen saturation (SpO₂), heart rate and plethysmographic waveform from pulse oximetry. Behavioural state was scored using observation and video and classified as awake (feeding, active or quiet) or sleep. Results: Thirteen infants had analysable data, although one had strikingly lower SpO₂ values while awake and was excluded from analysis. The infants had a median gestation of 26 weeks and were studied at a median (range) postmenstrual age of 66 (37–130) weeks, for 229 (89–330) min. Mean SpO₂ was 97.6% during sleep and 97.0% awake (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Babies with CNLD have lower oxygen saturation while awake. There is no physiological justification for increasing oxygen during sleep, or withdrawing selectively during the daytime, although larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.

N2  - Reviews the book, Get me out—History of childbirth from the Garden of Eden to the sperm bank edited by R. H. Epstein (2011). This book presents a fascinating odyssey through shifting views and handling ⁄ control of fertility, pregnancy and obstetrical care. The book is devoted to the process of becoming pregnant, describing previous ideas and concepts of how a woman actually gets to carry a baby to today’s increasing use of sperm and egg donors, infertility treatment, surrogacy and egg preservation. The book covers a large variety of themes which includes changes in the understanding and prophylaxis of life-threatening puerperal fever, development of maternity wards, the strange concept of sleeping through delivery of the early 20th century, termed twilight sleep and changes in birth pain perception and care. A small objection to the book is that it reflects the author’s and her potential readers own situation and historical development. The book does not give a global perspective on how resources are allocated to achieve successful fertility and delivery. This varies throughout the world today and also within countries with large socioeconomic variations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Aim: To determine the relationship between the working situation (full-time housewife, stopped working during pregnancy, or currently employed) and the lifestyle factors, reasons for stopping work during pregnancy, and effects of working conditions in order to identify the factors that are related to the continuation of employment among pregnant Japanese women. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was administered to pregnant women who visited an obstetrics clinic in a Tokyo suburb for an outpatient medical check-up during July and August 2004. Results: The data of 530 healthy pregnant women were analyzed. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy had lower mental health scores than the full-time housewives and employed pregnant women. In each trimester, the employed pregnant women reported a shorter daytime sleep duration than the pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy and the full-time housewives. The reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were categorized as somatic symptoms due to pregnancy, working conditions, and a sense of values or social reasons. The employed women in the third trimester more often reported the availability of, and access to, a rest area in their company, compared to those in the first and second trimesters. Conclusion: The lifestyle factors of the pregnant women were different, based on their work situation. In particular, the employed pregnant women had a shorter daytime sleep duration. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy could have benefited from mental health support. In addition, the reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were different in the three trimesters. A flexible system is needed for working women that adapts to the physical changes that occur during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: There is a gap in the knowledge of longterm outcome of mild to moderate prematures compared to the extreme prematures or very low birth weight infants. Aim: Determine health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems in (pre-)school age children born at 32 to 36 weeks' gestation. Study design: A descriptive cohort study in a non-Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Patient characteristics, diagnoses, treatment and social economic status (SES) were analyzed. Study tools were the TNO-AZL Preschool Quality of Life (TAPQoL) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Subjects: 362 children born between 32 and 36 weeks' gestation who had a follow-up evaluation at 2–5 years of age. Outcome measure: Health-related quality of life and the occurrence of emotional and behavioral problems. Results: Main characteristics (mean ± SD) were: gestation 34.7 ± 1 weeks and birth weight 2360 ± 444 g. Most families were two-parent middle-class households with parents employed at their educational level. Questionnaire response rate was 62.7%. The 12-item TAPQoL showed significantly lower scores for stomach and liveliness, while scores for behavior, communication and sleep were significantly higher compared to the general population. The TAPQoL subscale score for lung problems was significantly lower for children who had received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CBCL scores were within the validated normal range although the study-population scored higher on emotionally reactive, somatic complaints and attention problems compared to their full-term peers. Conclusion: Children born at 32 to 36 weeks' gestational age do not experience an overall lower HR-QoL at 2 to 5 years of age. CPAP results in lower HRQoL scores for lung problems. The overall occurrence of behavioral and emotional problems does not differ from the general term-born pediatric population. Several subitems need further attention.

N2  - Objective: The etiology of preterm birth (PTB) is likely caused by multiple factors, which may include disturbed sleep. We evaluated whether sleep disturbance was associated with PTB and whether the association was affected by other psychosocial risk factors. Methods: Pregnant women (n = 217) for whom we had depression and sleep data at 20 or 30 weeks gestation and delivery information were evaluated. Logistic models were used to test the hypotheses that disturbed sleep was associated with PTB. Results: Time in bed at 20 weeks was significantly associated with risk for preterm delivery (odds ratio [OR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.88). However, after controlling for depression/selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) status, history of PTB, age, employment, and marital status, this relationship was no longer significant (OR 1.26, 95% CI .92-1.71). No other relationships were significant. Conclusions: We report preliminary evidence suggesting that poor sleep may contribute to risk for PTB. Although it is speculative and additional work is needed to confirm or refute whether sleep is an independent or mediating risk factor for PTB, disturbed sleep does appear to play a role in adverse pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Study Objectives: Preterm birth (PTB) is a major public health priority and the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Several risk factors have been identified, but a gap in the understanding of the underlying etiology of PTB persists. Poor sleep quality is a correlate of adverse health outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated whether sleep quality during pregnancy was a clinically relevant risk factor for PTB. Design: Observational Measurements and Results: Participants included 166 pregnant women (mean age = 28.6 ± 5.5 years). Self-report questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), were administered at 14-16, 24-26, and 30-32 weeks gestation. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate whether sleep quality was associated with preterm delivery. Poor sleep quality was a predictor of preterm birth, with the largest effects in early pregnancy (14-16 weeks) (OR: 1.25 95% CI [1.04-1.50], P = 0.02) and more modest effects in later pregnancy (30-32 weeks) (OR: 1.18 95% CI [0.98-1.42], P = 0.07). With every one-point increase on the PSQI, the odds of preterm birth increase 25% in early pregnancy and 18% in later pregnancy. Conclusions: Poor sleep quality, in both early and late pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk of delivering preterm. Currently the specific pathway(s) through which disturbed sleep contributes to PTB are unknown. We suggest that poor sleep may contribute to increased risk for PTB both independently, as well as in conjunction with other established risk factors, such as stress.

N2  - Background: Gestational hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy. Recent evidence suggests that women with gestational hypertension have a high rate of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Using laboratory-based polysomnography, we evaluated for the frequency of SDB in women with gestational hypertension compared to healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Methods: In this single-center cross-sectional study, women with the diagnosis of gestational hypertension were screened in the Fetal Assessment Unit and Antepartum ward. Healthy subjects were recruited by local advertising. Subjects completed a series of questionnaires addressing sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, followed by full night polysomnography. The primary outcome was frequency of SDB (defined as a respiratory disturbance index ≥ 5) in the gestational hypertension and healthy groups. Results: A total of 34 women with gestational hypertension and singleton pregnancies and 26 healthy women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies consented to participate in the study. The mean ages and gestational ages, but not the body mass indices, of the 2 groups were similar. The frequencies of SDB in the more obese gestational hypertension group and the healthy group were 53% and 12%, respectively (P < 0.001). Interpretation: Women with gestational hypertension may have a significantly higher frequency of SDB than do healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of similar gestational age. The relative causal contributions, if any, of SDB and obesity remain to be determined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)
