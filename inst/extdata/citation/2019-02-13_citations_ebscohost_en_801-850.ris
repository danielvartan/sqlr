AB  - Background: The Auckland Stillbirth study demonstrated a two-fold increased risk of late stillbirth for women who did not go to sleep on their left side. Two further studies have confirmed an increased risk of late stillbirth with supine sleep position. As sleep position is modifiable, we surveyed self-reported late pregnancy sleep position, knowledge about sleep position, and views about changing going-to-sleep position.Methods: Participants in this 2014 survey were pregnant women (n = 377) in their third trimester from South Auckland, New Zealand, a multi-ethnic and predominantly low socio-economic population. An ethnically-representative sample was obtained using random sampling. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with non-left sided going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy.Results: Respondents were 28 to 42 weeks' gestation. Reported going-to-sleep position in the last week was left side (30%), right side (22%), supine (3%), either side (39%) and other (6%). Two thirds (68%) reported they had received advice about sleep position. Non-left sleepers were asked if they would be able to change to their left side if it was better for their baby; 87% reported they would have little or no difficulty changing. Women who reported a non-left going-to-sleep position were more likely to be of Maori (aOR 2.64 95% CI 1.23-5.66) or Pacific (aOR 2.91 95% CI 1.46-5.78) ethnicity; had a lower body mass index (BMI) (aOR 0.93 95% CI 0.89-0.96); and were less likely to sleep on the left-hand side of the bed (aOR 3.29 95% CI 2.03-5.32).Conclusions: Maternal going-to-sleep position in the last week was side-lying in 91% of participants. The majority had received advice to sleep on their side or avoid supine sleep position. Sleeping on the left-hand side of the bed was associated with going-to-sleep on the left side. Most non-left sleepers reported their sleeping position could be modified to the left side suggesting a public health intervention about sleep position is likely to be feasible in other multi-ethnic communities.

AB  - Few studies have investigated maternal fatigue, particularly fatigue throughout the duration of pregnancy and the postpartum period. The purpose of this study was to explore changes related to maternal fatigue from pregnancy to postpartum and the factors influencing fatigue. This prospective longitudinal study surveyed 197 pregnant women beyond 24 gestational weeks monthly until one month postpartum. The Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale and one question about fatigue were used. Women at late pregnancy experienced a significant increase in level of fatigue, which remained high after childbirth. Those who were not happy about the pregnancy or were multiparas experienced a higher level of prenatal fatigue than their counterparts. At postpartum, mothers who were unemployed, had no one to help with childcare, or felt that the baby's night-time sleep pattern was a serious problem had a higher level of fatigue. Interventions can be planned and implemented at early pregnancy to reduce the prevalence of fatigue. Encouraging pregnant women to share experiences and thoughts about pregnancy and being a mother is suggested. Further studies that evaluate culturally sensitive instruments for fatigue are needed.

AB  - Background Advances in genetic technologies have resulted in the diagnosis during pregnancy of increasing numbers of fetal abnormalities. A few published personal commentaries have indicated that health professionals' interactions with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality can be emotionally and ethically challenging, highlighting the need for empirical research in this area. This study sought to explore whether working in the fetal medicine setting has an effect on health professionals and to ascertain any supports used to manage these effects. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 40 medical and allied health professionals working in fetal medicine settings in Melbourne, Australia. Qualitative analysis of the interview data was performed using thematic analysis. Results Participants discussed at length the emotional impact of working with patients who were experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes. All participants reported that working in fetal medicine had an impact on their daily lives, and many spoke about dreaming about or losing sleep over patient outcomes. Participants described working in this setting as being particularly difficult when they were pregnant themselves. Most spoke about feeling largely unsupported in their work and felt that these effects resulted in burnout and staff turnover. Conclusions This study explored several work force concerns in fetal medicine. Health professionals working with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality are vulnerable to the phenomena of compassion fatigue and burnout. The need for formal support and self-care management is suggested. ( BIRTH 40:1 March 2013)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The few existing early-life obesity prevention initiatives have concentrated on nutrition and physical activity, with little examination of sleep. METHODS: This community-based, randomized controlled trial allocated 802 pregnant women (≥16 years, <34 weeks' gestation) to: control, FAB (food, activity, and breastfeeding), sleep, or combination (both interventions) groups. All groups received standard well-child care. FAB participants received additional support (8 contacts) promoting breastfeeding, healthy eating, and physical activity (antenatal-18 months). Sleep participants received 2 sessions (antenatal, 3 weeks) targeting prevention of sleep problems, as well as a sleep treatment program if requested (6-24 months). Combination participants received both interventions (9 contacts). BMI was measured at 24 months by researchers blinded to group allocation, and secondary outcomes (diet, physical activity, sleep) were assessed by using a questionnaire or accelerometry at multiple time points. RESULTS: At 2 years, 686 women remained in the study (86%). No significant intervention effect was observed for BMI at 24 months (P= .086), but there was an overall group effect for the prevalence of obesity (P = .027). Exploratory analyses found a protective effect for obesity among those receiving the "sleep intervention" (sleep and combination compared with FAB and control: odds ratio, 0.54 [95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.82]). No effect was observed for the "FAB intervention" (FAB and combination compared with sleep and control: odds ratio, 1.20 [95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.81]). CONCLUSIONS: A well-developed food and activity intervention did not seem to affect children's weight status. However, further research on more intensive or longer running sleep interventions is warranted.

AB  - Twilight Sleep (TS) describes the delivery, via an injection, of an amnestic drug cocktail to a parturient woman throughout labor. In order to understand the development of modern-day rhetoric surrounding childbirth methods and procedures, this article explores the debate over TS between the public and technical sphere in New York City between 1914 and 1916 and examines the ways in which this debate altered obstetric health care for middle- and upper-class White women. The public response to this campaign posed a direct challenge to male obstetricians in New York City, many of whom were ill-equipped, both literally and figuratively, to use this procedure. Using a feminist rhetorical criticism, we examined the pro-TS rhetoric of women writers in New York City, the methods they borrowed from the women’s movement, and the ensuing dialogue between the public and technical spheres. For this study, we analyzed journal and newspaper articles, a pamphlet, a collection of pro-TS organizational documents, letters to the editor, and books published about TS and the history of birth. Lastly, we analyzed theoretical notions of childbirth in women’s health and communication studies. After examining the TS debate, we found that birth practices for middle- and upper-class women in New York City shifted and the obstetric community gained ascendancy over female midwifery. We also found that in certain instances, the rhetoric of pro-TS activists was more technically accurate than the rhetoric of some physicians. Hence the TS debate emerged from an argument over the right to use technical language in the technical and/or the public sphere. Conclusions and implications offered by this historical, feminist analysis question our current understanding of women’s health and birthing practices, doctor–patient communication, and patient empowerment and access to technical knowledge.

AB  - Physical activity is associated with improved sleep quality and duration in the general population, but its effect on sleep in postpartum women is unknown. We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between hours/week of self-reported domain-specific and overall moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sleep quality and duration at 3- and 12-months postpartum among a cohort of 530 women in the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Postpartum Study. MVPA was not associated with sleep quality or duration at 3-months postpartum. At 12-months postpartum, a 1 h/week increase in recreational MVPA was associated with higher odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (odds ratio, OR 1.14; 95 % confidence interval, CI, 1.03-1.27) and a 1 h/week increase in child/adult care MVPA was associated with lower odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (OR = 0.93; 95 % CI 0.88-0.99). A 1 h/week increase in child/adult care MVPA (OR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.00-1.16) was associated with higher odds of long sleep duration and 1 h/week increases in indoor household (OR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.01-1.18) and overall MVPA (OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07) were associated with higher odds of short (vs. normal) sleep duration. Comparing 3-months postpartum to 12-months postpartum, increased work MVPA was associated with good sleep quality (OR 2.40, 95 % CI 1.12-5.15) and increased indoor household MVPA was associated with short sleep duration (OR 1.85, 95 % CI 1.05-3.27) as measured at 12-months postpartum. Selected domains of MVPA and their longitudinal increases were associated with sleep quality and duration at 12-months postpartum. Additional research is needed to elucidate whether physical activity can improve postpartum sleep.

AB  - Short sleep duration is associated with multiple adverse child outcomes. We examined associations of the built environment with infant sleep duration among 1226 participants in a pre-birth cohort. From residential addresses, we used a geographic information system to determine urbanicity, population density, and closeness to major roadways. The main outcome was mother's report of her infant's average daily sleep duration at 1 year of age. We ranked urbanicity and population density as quintiles, categorized distance to major roads into 8 categories, and used linear regression adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, smoking during pregnancy, gestational age, fetal growth, and television viewing at 1 year. In this sample, mean (SD) sleep duration at age 1 year was 12.8 (1.6)h/day. In multivariable adjusted analyses, children living in the highest quintile of urbanicity slept -19.2 min/day (95% CI:-37.0, -1.50) less than those living in the lowest quintile. Neither population density nor closeness to major roadways was associated with infant sleep duration after multivariable adjustment. Our findings suggest that living in more urban environments may be associated with reduced infant sleep.

AB  - Background: The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of medical disorders (obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin/resistance/glucose intolerance) that characteristically occur together in individuals. The prevalence of MetS continues to increase in the U.S. and increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality. Little research uses a theoretical model to identify direct or indirect contributions to MetS and predictors to MetS. Identifying the factors that influence MetS in a national sample is necessary to understand targets for intervention to prevent the MetS and its sequelae.Purpose: This study tested a hypothesized conceptual model of the biopsychosocial factors associated with MetS in adults using a representative sample.Methods: A secondary data analysis was conducted using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2008 data from non-pregnant participants who were 20-80 years old and completed the questionnaire and medical examination with fasting laboratory data. The sample of 2,583 adults represented 212 million non-institutionalized civilian Americans living in the U.S. Path analysis was conducted to test the biopsychosocial model of MetS. Complex samples logistic regression models (CSLR) were utilized to examine the direct and indirect contributions of biomedical (age), biosocial (gender, race, education, income, and marital status), and psychosocial factors (depressive symptoms, diet, physical activity, smoking status, and sleep) to MetS.Results: Of the study population, 29% met the criteria for MetS and 95% had at least one component of MetS. The hypothesized model fit the nationally representative data. The parsimonious model with age, gender, race, education, income, depressive symptoms, physical activity, smoking, and the interaction between age and physical activity explained 25.2% of the variance in the presence of MetS. Mediating effects among the biosocial and psychosocial factors help explain their relationship with MetS.Conclusion: The study supported the hypothesized model and the contributions of biopsychosocial factors to MetS. The study indicated that certain demographic groups were vulnerable to MetS. More studies are needed to examine factors associated with MetS than were from the hypothesized model. Prospective studies are needed to improve psychosocial status and to prevent/reverse MetS.

AB  - Not using the infant back sleep position is an established risk factor for sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). Infant bed sharing may also increase SUID risk, particularly under certain circumstances. Both of these infant sleeping behaviors are disproportionately higher among Black mothers. We explored the relationship between not using the infant back sleeping and infant bed sharing, developed separate risk factor profiles for these behaviors, and identified maternal characteristics contributing to racial differences in their practice. Merged 2004-2005 birth certificate and Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data for 2,791 non-Hispanic Black and White Florida women were evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses to develop risk factor profiles for infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing. Cross-product interaction terms were introduced to identify factors contributing to racial differences. Infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing were reported by two-thirds of Black women and one-third of White women. There was no association between the infant sleeping behaviors when adjusted for race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.31). The infant sleeping behaviors shared no common independent maternal characteristics. Father acknowledgement on the birth certificate was a strong contributor to racial differences in infrequent back sleeping while breastfeeding, trimester of entry to prenatal care, and maternal depression revealed notable racial differences for bed sharing. Behavior-specific and race-specific public health messages may be an important public health strategy for reducing risky infant sleeping behaviors and decreasing SUIDs.

AB  - Time of day is a critical factor for most biological functions, but concepts from the field of chronobiology have yet to be fully translated to clinical practice. Circadian rhythms, generated internally and synchronised to the external environment, promote function and support survival in almost every living species. Fetal circadian rhythms can be observed in utero from 30weeks gestation, coupled to the maternal rhythm, but synchronise to the external environment only after birth. Important cues for synchronisation include the light/dark cycle, the timing of feeding, and exposure to melatonin in breast milk. Disruption to these cues may occur during admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. This can impair the development of circadian rhythms, and influence survival and function in the neonatal period, with a potential to impact health and well-being throughout adult life. Here we outline the rationale and evidence to support a chronobiological approach to neonatal care.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this article is to review the clinical challenges of obesity in obstetrics from the anaesthetist's viewpoint. RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of obesity continues to increase both in the community and on the labour ward. Women who have undergone bariatric surgery are also on rise. During pregnancy, obesity is associated with hypertensive disease (chronic hypertension and preeclampsia), diabetes mellitus (pregestational and gestational), respiratory disorders (asthma and sleep apnoea), thromboembolic disease, caesarean section and infections (primarily urinary tract infections, wound infections and endometritis). Obesity is a risk factor for anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. Obese women are not only at high-risk of airway complications, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, perioperative morbidity and mortality but also pose technical challenges. Obesity also influences the fetal outcomes. Increasing use of regional techniques contributes to the reduced anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. Preconception counselling, antenatal screening and anaesthetic assessment are strongly encouraged. SUMMARY: Effective communication and good teamwork between an anaesthetist and an obstetrician are essential for the care of obese parturients. A more liberalized use of regional techniques may be a means of further reducing the anaesthesia-related maternal mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the circadian rhythm of blood pressure during pregnancy. DATA SOURCES: Computerized searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL, and MIRLYN. STUDY SELECTION: Selected studies from 1 969 to 1997 were evaluated. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and information was organized under the following areas: definition of and the interconnection between circadian rhythm and blood pressure; the circadian variability of blood pressure throughout the trimesters; the patterns of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure in pregnancies defined as normal and those complicated by chronic hypertension and preeclampsia; and clinical implications. DATA SYNTHESIS: The circadian rhythm of blood pressure in pregnancy is the same as in the non-pregnant state, with a nocturnal decrease, especially during sleep. In patients with chronic hypertension, the nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be steeper. Patients with mild preeclampsia may experience a less pronounced nocturnal decrease in blood pressure. Patients with severe preeclampsia may display a reversed circadian rhythm, with no decrease and/or an increase in nocturnal blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure during normal pregnancy and pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension and preeclampsia warrant consideration when monitoring patients and implementing management plans.

AB  - Context: Disturbed circadian rhythms and sleep quality during pregnancy have been related to gestational weight gain and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which affect postpartum glucose metabolism and future risk of type 2 diabetes.Objective: We assessed whether the circadian rhythm-related melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) genotype was associated with 1 to 5 years of postpartum glycemic changes among women with a history of GDM and whether gestational weight gain modified such associations.Design, Settings, and Participants: The established circadian rhythm-associated MTNR1B genetic variant (rs10830963) was genotyped in 1025 Chinese women with a history of GDM. Body weight and glycemic traits, during and after pregnancy, were longitudinally collected.Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measure was postpartum glycemic changes.Results: We found that women carrying different MTNR1B genotypes showed distinct postpartum changes in 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test: 0.36, 0.20, and -0.19 mM per additional copy of the shorter sleep duration-related G allele in women with inadequate, adequate, and excessive gestational weight gain, respectively (for interaction, P = 0.028). The corresponding changes in fasting glucose were 0.14, 0.13, and 0.01 mM, although the modification effect of gestational weight gain on the genetic association was marginally significant (for interaction, P = 0.067).Conclusions: Our findings suggest that gestational weight gain may modify the circadian rhythm-related MTNR1B genetic variant on long-term glycemic changes, highlighting the significance of gestational weight management in diabetes prevention among women with GDM.

AB  - Objectives. To evaluate the impact of the Southern Public Health Regions’ (Regions IV and IV) Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network (CoIIN) to Reduce Infant Mortality, supported by the US Health Resources and Services Administration. Methods. We examined pre–post change (2011–2014) for CoIIN strategies with available outcome data from vital records (early elective delivery, smoking) and the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (safe sleep) as well as preterm birth and infant mortality for Regions IV and VI relative to all other regions. Results. For most outcomes, CoIIN improvements were greater in Regions IV and VI than in other regions. For example, early elective delivery decreased by 22% versus 14% in other regions, smoking cessation during pregnancy increased by 7% versus 2%, and back sleep position increased by 5%versus 2%. Preterm birth decreased by 4%, twice that observed in other regions, but infant mortality reductions did not differ significantly. Conclusions. The CoIIN approach to public health improvement shows promise in accelerating progress in intermediate outcomes and preterm birth. Impact on infant mortality may require additional strategies and sustained efforts.

AB  - Background: Chronic pelvic pain has often been described as a major women's health issue, but no information exists on the extent of the problem in the United Kingdom. Aim: To investigate the community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain and its effect on the lives of consulting and non-consulting women. Design Of Study: Postal questionnaire survey. Setting: Women aged 18 to 49 (n = 3916) randomly selected from the Oxfordshire Health Authority Register. Method: The questionnaire response rate (adjusted for non-deliveries) was 74% (2304/3106). Chronic pelvic pain was defined as recurrent or constant pelvic pain of at least six months' duration, unrelated to periods, intercourse, or pregnancy. Case subgroups comprised recent consulters, past consulters, and non-consulters. Women who reported dysmenorrhoea alone formed a comparison group. Results: The three-month prevalence of chronic pelvic pain was 24.0% (95% CI = 22.1% to 25.8%). One-third of women reported pain that started more than five years ago. Recent consulters (32% of cases) were most affected by their symptoms in terms of pain severity, use of health care, physical and mental health scores, sleep quality, and pain-related absence from work. Non-consulters (41% of cases) did not differ from women with dysmenorrhoea in terms of symptom-related impairment. Irrespective of consulting behaviour, a high rate of symptom-related anxiety was found in women with chronic pelvic pain (31%) compared with women with dysmenorrhoea (7%). Conclusions: This study showed a high community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain in women of reproductive age. Cases varied substantially in the degree to which they were affected by their symptoms. The high symptom-related anxiety in these women emphasises the need for more information about chronic pelvic pain and its possible causes.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are common among pregnant women and pregnant women with obesity are especially prone to problems sleeping. Disturbed sleep is independently associated with the inflammatory process and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Safe treatment options to enhance sleep during pregnancy are needed. The primary aim of the study was to test Pender's Health Promotion Model (HPM) by evaluating the contribution of physical activity (PA) to sleep parameters in pregnant women, particularly within the context of prepregnant body mass index (BMI). Twenty-nine sedentary women in the second trimester were enrolled in an 8-week PA intervention pilot study and randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Survey data, including the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), provided descriptive data. Steps per day, as measured by pedometer, and sleep parameters (sleep onset latency [SOL], wake time after sleep onset [WASO], total sleep time [TST], and sleep quality), obtained from sleep diaries, collected for 3 days at the beginning and end of the program, were used to evaluate the daily interaction between PA levels and sleep in pregnancy. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used for analysis, as data were nested within persons. No significant change occurred over the course of the study in either PA levels or sleep parameters. Prepregnant BMI contributed negatively to PA levels (p = 0 0033), PA levels were positively predictive (p = 0.037) of sleep onset latency (SOL) and negatively predictive (p = 0.01) of sleep quality, demonstrating a negative effect of PA on sleep when measured daily. These results contradict findings from other studies that evaluated the PA level-sleep relationship over a week or month. Small sample and selection bias may have contributed to these results. The effect of daily PA level on sleep during pregnancy may have time-of-day, dose, and intensity components that need further study.

AB  - ypical and melancholic subtypes of depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV are important concepts, especially for biological psychiatry. The aim of this study was to determine whether the symptoms used for the diagnoses of atypical and melancholic depression can distinguish these subtypes during pregnancy. A modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID interview) was used that allowed assessment of all DSM IV symptoms of melancholic and atypical depression with depressed and non-depressed women in pregnancy. A Swiss cohort of 449 women was interviewed. Four diagnostic groups were compared: women with melancholic, atypical or non specified depression, and those without depression. Seventeen per cent of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depressive episode of depression at least once in pregnancy, with melancholic depression 2.4%, atypical depression 4.4% and non specified depression 10.2%. Many of the symptoms used to distinguish atypical and melancholic depression did not discriminate between these groups during pregnancy. However some, such as mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern, did discriminate. Differential diagnosis between melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy needs to be based on pregnancy specific definitions. The possible therapeutic consequences and the neurobiological basis for these findings warrant further research.

AB  - Background: The article was designed to estimate the effect of active and passive household cigarette smoke exposure on asthma severity and obstetric and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with asthma.Methods: We used a secondary observational analysis of pregnant women with mild and moderate-severe asthma enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study of asthma in pregnancy and a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing inhaled beclomethasone and oral theophylline. A baseline questionnaire detailing smoking history and passive household smoke exposure was given to each patient. Smoking status was confirmed in the RCT using cotinine levels. Data on asthma severity and obstetric and neonatal outcomes were collected and analyzed with respect to self-reported tobacco smoke exposure. Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson chi(2) statistics were used to test for significance.Results: A total of 2,210 women were enrolled: 1,812 in the observational study and 398 in the RCT. Four hundred and eight (18%) women reported current active smoking. Of the nonsmokers, 790 (36%) women reported passive household smoke exposure. Active smoking was associated with more total symptomatic days (P < .001) and nights of sleep disturbance (P < .001). Among the newborns of active smokers, there was a greater risk of small for gestational age < 10th percentile (P < .001), and a lower mean birth weight (P < .001). There were no differences in symptom exacerbation or outcome between nonsmokers with and without passive household cigarette smoke exposure.Conclusions: Among pregnant women with asthma, active but not passive smoking is associated with increased asthma symptoms and fetal growth abnormalities.

AB  - Women with gestational diabetes (GD) are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (DM) after delivery compared to those without GD. Numerous studies in the general population have identified that adoption of healthy lifestyles can prevent DM; however limited research has focused on women with GD. The purpose of this randomized pilot study was to determine the effectiveness of an educational intervention of SUGAR (S?tart U?nderstanding G?estational Diabetes a?nd R?isk of Type 2 Diabetes), on women's perceived risk of developing DM, knowledge of DM, self-efficacy to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors and adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors after childbirth among women with GD.A total of 23 women (mean age of 29.7+/-3.9), 18 in SUGAR group and 5 in control group (CG) completed self-reported standardized questionnaires (Risk Perception Survey for Developing Diabetes adapted for women with GD; Self-Rated Abilities for Health Practices; Health Promotion Lifestyle Profile II; General Sleep Disturbance Scale; and Demographic Questionnaire) at baseline (third trimester) and post-test (postpartum 6- 8 weeks). Intervention was given post the baseline data collection with a booster session at 2-4 weeks postpartum. The women in CG received attention control treatment.Study participants were obese (BMI M-33.1, SD-7.7) and a majority had a family history of DM. Findings showed that self-efficacy was the single significant predictor and accounted for 22% of the variance of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Participants had a clinical significant sleep disturbance during both pregnancy and postpartum. At baseline, poor sleepers reported a lower self-efficacy. The intervention significantly increased DM knowledge for women in the SUGAR group; however, not for perceived risk, self-efficacy nor healthy lifestyle behaviors. There was no difference between groups for postpartum glucose screening rates with only 39% receiving recommended testing.Future research needs to focus on prevention programs and center on self-efficacy, postpartum glucose screening, improve sleep, and adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors. To ensure a better preventive care for GD women, education provided for both patients and health care provider is needed.

AB  - Preterm infants' outcomes vary with illness and degree of neurological insult. Evidence suggests that continuous bright light levels in particular, may have negative effects on growth and development. However, little data exists to suggest how much and when light stimulation is appropriate. This study utilized a longitudinal randomized experimental design to examine the timing and effects of cycled light and continuous near darkness throughout hospitalization on the health and development of preterm infants <31 weeks gestation. Sixty two infants were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: near darkness from birth to 32 weeks gestation followed by cycled light until discharge, cycled light throughout hospitalization, or near darkness throughout the hospitalization with cycled light at 36 weeks gestation in preparation for discharge.This study failed to reveal any significant benefits of near darkness over cycled light from birth for weight gain, length of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, neurobehavioral development, and sleep-wake states outcomes. The weight gain of the group of infants that received cycled light from birth was greater, though not significantly so, than the weight gain for infants receiving near darkness until 36 weeks gestation. Infants receiving near darkness until 36 weeks gestation developed more severe ROP throughout hospitalization and more elevated heart rates than the infants receiving cycled light from birth. In addition, infants receiving near darkness at birth followed by cycled light at 32 weeks gestation had significantly more failures on the BAER than infants receiving near darkness followed by cycled light at 36 weeks gestation. Yet, there were no differences in the number of BAER failures between the infants receiving cycled light from birth and the infants receiving near darkness followed by cycled light at 36 weeks.The findings of this study consistently supported the idea that continuous near darkness for hospitalized preterm infants has no significant advantages over cycled light. Future research should continue the direction begun by this study to ascertain the most appropriate time to begin cycled light in the neonatal environment and optimal level of illumination during day lighting.

AB  - Aim: To compare the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of labetalol and nifedipine modified release (MR) in hypertensive pregnant women. We also investigated the effect on the heart rate (HR) and determined the proportion of time spent in target.Methods: This was an exploratory study. Women with chronic hypertension taking either labetalol or nifedipine were offered 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Sleep, wake and drug ingestion times were self-reported. An indirect response model was used to analyse the systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and HR time-series; the effect of gestation and type of drug was evaluated.Results: Forty-eight women were recruited: 24 in each group. There was no difference in clinical characteristics. In women taking nifedipine there was a positive association between the dose of nifedipine and pre-dose BP p = .002, this was not present in the labetalol group. There was a difference between the drug effects on both the SBP and DBP time-series (p = .014). In comparison to labetalol, there was less variation in day time BP in those women prescribed nifedipine. Women on labetalol spent a larger proportion of time with their DBP below target (<80 mmHg). The HR dynamics were qualitatively different, a stimulatory effect was found with nifedipine compared to an inhibitory effect with labetalol.Conclusion: There are significant and important differences between the BP lowering effects of nifedipine and labetalol. A large randomised control trial is required to investigate the relationship between BP variability and time in target on pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of leptin and other selected variables on gestational weight gain (GWG) according to pre-gestational body mass index (BMI).Design: Prospective cohort.Setting: Public Health Center, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Sample: Two hundred and twenty-eight pregnant women.Methods: Women were followed at the 5-13, 20-26 and 30-36th gestational weeks. The effects of independent variables on GWG in normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2) ), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2) ) and obese (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m(2) ) women were assessed using longitudinal linear mixed-effects models.Main Outcome Measure: Maternal body weight (kg) throughout pregnancy.Results: Leptin concentrations were associated with GWG in normal weight (β = 0.048, P < 0.001) and overweight (β = 0.023, P = 0.048) women, but not in obese ones (β = 0.011, P = 0.308). Additionally, the number of hours slept per night decreased the effect of leptin on GWG in OW women (β = -0.013, P = 0.002). The effect of other maternal characteristics on GWG was different depending on the BMI category.Conclusions: Leptin concentrations were positively associated with GWG in normal weight and overweight women, but not in obese ones. Maternal height was associated with GWG in all BMI categories, but other variables such as sleep duration, QUICKI values, HDL-c, smoking habit and marital status presented differential effects according to BMI. We encourage further studies to investigate the association between leptin and gestational weight gain, taking into account the pre-pregnancy weight and sleep duration, in order to compare and confirm our results.Tweetable Abstract: Leptin is associated with weight gain in normal weight and overweight pregnant women, but not in obese ones.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective To determine the effect of maternal presence on the physiological and behavioral status of the preterm infant when exposed to recorded music versus ambient sound. Design Repeated-measures randomized controlled trial. Setting Special care nursery (SCN) in a tertiary perinatal center. Participants Clinically stable preterm infants (22) born at > 28 weeks gestation and enrolled at > 32 weeks gestation and their mothers. Methods Infants were exposed to lullaby music (6 minutes of ambient sound alternating with 2x 6 minutes recorded lullaby music) at a volume within the recommended sound level for the SCN. The mothers in the experimental group were present for the first 12 minutes (baseline and first music period) whereas the mothers in the control group were absent overall. Results There was no discernible infant response to music and therefore no significant impact of maternal presence on infant's response to music over time. However during the mothers' presence (first 12 minutes), the infants exhibited significantly higher oxygen saturation than during their absence p = .024) and less time spent in quiet sleep after their departure, though this was not significant. Conclusion Infants may have been unable to detect the music against the ambient soundscape. Regardless of exposure to music, the infants' physiological and behavioral regulation were affected by the presence and departure of the mothers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the effect of maternal sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) on infant general movements (GMs) and neurodevelopment. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women with uncomplicated full-term pregnancies and their offspring were prospectively recruited from a community and hospital low-risk obstetric surveillance. All participants completed a sleep questionnaire on second trimester and underwent ambulatory sleep evaluation (WatchPAT; Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). They were categorized as SDB (apnea hypopnea index >5) and controls. Infant GMs were assessed in the first 48 hours and at 8-11 and 14-16 weeks of age. At 12 months of age the Infant Developmental Inventory and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire were administered. RESULTS: In all, 74 women and their full-term infants were studied. Eighteen (24%) women had SDB. Mean birthweight was 3347.1 ± 423.9 g. Median Apgar score at 5 minutes was 10 (range, 8-10). In adjusted comparisons, no differences were found between infants born to mothers with SDB and controls in GM scores in all 3 evaluations. Low social developmental score was detected at 12 months in 64% of infants born to SDB mothers compared to 25% of infants born to controls (adjusted P = .036; odds ratio, 16.7). Infant snoring was reported by 41.7% of mothers with SDB compared to 7.5% of controls (P = .004). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that maternal SDB during pregnancy has no adverse effect on neonatal and infant neuromotor development but may affect social development at 1 year.

AB  - Objective: To examine the relationship between sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and smoking during pregnancy; postnatal tobacco smoke exposure from the mother, father, live-in-adults, and day care providers; and postnatal smoke exposure from breast-feeding.Design: Case-control study.Setting: Five counties in Southern California.Participants: A total of 200 white, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian parents of infants who died of SIDS between 1989 and 1992 were compared with 200 control parents who delivered healthy infants. Case infants were matched to control infants on the basis of birth hospital, birth date, gender, and race. All information was obtained from a detailed telephone interview and validated with medical records.Main Outcome Measures: Risk of SIDS associated with passive smoking by the mother, father, live-in adults, and day care providers; smoking in the same room as the infant; total number of cigarettes smoked by all adults; and maternal smoking during the time period of breast-feeding.Results: Conditional logistic regression resulted in overall adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for SIDS associated with passive smoke from the mother of 2.28, the father of 3.46, other live-in adults of 2.18, and all sources of 3.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.81 to 6.75), while simultaneously adjusting for birth weight, sleep position, prenatal care, medical conditions at birth, breast-feeding, and maternal smoking during pregnancy. A dose-response effect was noted for SIDS associated with increasing numbers of cigarettes, as well as total number of smokers. Breast-feeding was protective for SIDS among nonsmokers (OR = 0.37) but not smokers (OR = 1.38), when adjusting for potential confounders.Conclusions: Passive smoking in the same room as the infant increases the risk for SIDS. Physicians should educate new and prospective parents about the risk of tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy and the first year of the infant's life.

AB  - Objective To assess the effects of relaxation exercises on subjective sleep quality of in third-trimester pregnant women. Materials and methods The pretest posttest randomized controlled trial recruited 84 pregnant women in the third trimester. Following random assignment of subjects, the treatment group (n = 46) performed relaxation exercises for four weeks and the control group (n = 46) received standart cares. At baseline and after the intervention sleep quality was assessed. Data obtained were analyzed in SPSS. Results The mean score of the global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was 7.12 ± 3.66. It was determined that relaxation exercises improved some sleep quality subscales including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration and habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction and global sleep quality. The difference between the two groups was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion A four -week compact disc guide relaxation exercises program can be effective in improving sleep quality.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Low back pain is one of the most common complaints in pregnancy which interferes with work, daily activities and sleep. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Sitting Pelvic Tilt Exercise on physical disability in primigravidas with low back pain during the third trimester. Materials and Methods: This quasi-experimental study was carried out on 60 primigravidas who attended in 3 prenatal clinics of Zanjan University of medical science. At first, 60 primigravidas were selected by simple sampling and randomly divided into two groups: case and control. Only the experimental group did the sitting pelvic tilt exercise program for 8 weeks during the third trimester. Data was collected for both groups by interview using VAS scale and Disability Rating Index (DRI) on the days 0 and 56 (pre and post intervention). Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, occupation, education and BMI and intensity of physical disability before the intervention. However, intensity of physical disability significantly decreased (p<0.0001) in the experimental group after the exercise program. Adversely, the intensity of physical disability increased in the control group as pregnancy proceed (p<0.0001). Intensity of low back pain was also reduced in the experimental group after the sitting pelvic tilt exercise program comparing to pre treatment stage and also in comparison with the control group (P<0.0001). Conclusion: It seems that use of exercise programs such as 'sitting pelvic tilt exercise' is an effective method in pregnant women who suffer from low back pain and related disabilities but do not want to use aggressive treatments and chemical pain relief drugs.

AB  - In regards to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Obesity, there is a worldwide pandemic causing great concern over these evolving and increasing diseases. 1 Statistics reflect that T2DM accounts for 85-90% of all cases of diabetes 1 around the world and one in ten adults are considered obese. 2 Worldwide approximations also reveal that 50% of the world's population is at risk of being vitamin D deficient. 3 The global rise in T2DM can be attributed to a change toward a western lifestyle leading to increases in overweight and obesity, which in turn promote insulin resistance. 4 Evidence of micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin D deficiency may also affect endocrine cells thus possibly leading to the increased risk of developing T2DM. 4 Epidemiological evidence supporting an inverse relationship between T2DM, obesity, and vitamin D deficiency (VDD), 5-11 may reveal a common denominator in regards to risk for metabolic processes. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) refers to impairment in insulin secretion and differing degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia. 15 Terms for DM classification have changed due to overlap in the age groups and respective treatments. 12 Outdated terms such as juvenile or adult onset diabetes have been replaced with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM.12 The international committee has determined that a Hemoglobin A1C (HGA1C) of 6.5% or above should be used for the diagnosis of diabetes. 14 There are two main types of DM; Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (TIDM) and T2DM. 15 Symptomatic hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis are typical of T1DM however, T2DM may not present with outright hyperglycemia. 15 Many times T2DM is detected during routine testing. 15 This review will use the HGA1C assay to determine glycemic control. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus The estimated worldwide incidence of individuals with diabetes was approximately 366 million in 2011 and is expected to rise to 552 million by 2030. 1 The growing epidemic of T2DM has prompted global concern 1,2 with a call for awareness, prevention and improved management of the disease. Experts speculate that the increased incidence in T2DM is a product of globalization, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and genetics. 1 The estimated worldwide incidence of diabetes was approximately 366 million in 2011 and is expected to rise to 552 million by 2030. 1 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus can lead to illness and a taxing financial burden, with T2DM contributing to over 20% of all deaths after the age of 49 for all regions of the world during 2011. 1 Worldwide estimates of health expenditures in 2010 accounted for $376 billion in T2DM related illnesses. 1 Projected costs by 2030 are expected to reach $490 billion without a concerted effort to control this disease. 1 In 2010, 1.9 million new cases of T2DM were diagnosed in the United States 12 and currently there are 25.8 million adults and children with all types of diabetes with at least 7.0 million people not yet diagnosed. 12 The growing epidemic of T2DM is the leading cause of new cases of blindness among people between the ages of 20 and 74 years of age. 12 People living with T2DM suffer from multiple complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, and neuropathies associated with the disease. 12 The total cost of T2DM in the U.S. for the year 2007 was $174 billion 12 and costs continue to rise in spite of educational programs. Worldwide efforts to reduce the financial and physiological burden of T2DM 1,2,12,13 exist, but have been unsuccessful. Researchers have been working diligently toward an efficient and economical alternative to the current status quo when it comes to traditional anti-diabetic treatment. Latest guideline changes to diagnosing and monitoring diabetes were announced during the 69th American Diabetic Association's (ADA) annual Scientific Session in 2009. 14 During this session, the ADA, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and European Association fo Overweight, Obesity, and Body Mass Index The substantial impact of obesity on subsequent metabolic disorders is a complex situation that requires further investigation. Obesity, now considered a chronic disease, is linked to hypertension, T2DM, insulin resistance, joint issues, and obstructive sleep apnea. 16 An energy imbalance is the best way to describe obesity; it means that the energy consumption out weights the energy expenditure 17 Overweight and obesity are defined as “abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health”. 2 BMI is determined by a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters. 1The World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight as a body mass index (BMI) of greater than or equal to 25 (kilograms per meters squared) kg/m2 and obesity as greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2. In 1980, over 1.5 million adults across the globe were considered overweight and the numbers have doubled. 2 Approximately 2.8 million deaths, 13 44% of diabetes, and 23% of heart disease cases are attributed to overweight and obesity across the globe.13 Disparities across all countries reflect that women with less education were two to three times more likely to be obese or overweight versus women with higher education. 18 Approximately 25% of the population in England are obese as well as 18% in Hungary and 15% in Spain and Ireland. 18 Adult Americans with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or greater are estimated at about 149.3 million. 16 The worldwide financial burden accounts for approximately 0.7% - 2.8% of total health-care costs 16 and American health-care costs related to obesity estimated to reach $861-957 billion by 2030. 13 By lowering BMI by 5 %, millions of dollars in healthcare costs could be saved. 18 Vitamin D Vitamin D, discovered in the 1700s, was not only used to cure rickets and improve osteomalacia 19 but since then has been associated with a reduction in cancer risk, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurological disorders, T1DM, and T2DM. 20 Investigators have also found increased levels of Vitamin D3 to be associated with reduced mortality rates of all causes. 20 In 1940, a physician researcher investigating skin cancer and sunlight discovered an inverse relationship between increased sunlight exposure and decreased incidence of all types of cancers except skin cancer. 21 That introduction into the biological effects of sunlight on cancer mortality rates, spurred interest in Vitamin D. The impetus for further investigation of Vitamin D began to evolve in 1970, when Holick 8 isolated 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 into the active form 1,25-dihydroxivitamin D3. 22 His seminal work 22 in this field revealed that many tissues and cells in the body have Vitamin D receptors (VDR) and thus have the ability of converting circulating Vitamin D or 25-hydroxyvitamin (D 25(OH)D3) to the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3). 8 There are two forms of Vitamin D; 19 they are Vitamin D2 or ergocalciferol and Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Plants synthesize ergocalciferol and the skin, when exposed to ultraviolet sunlight, synthesizes cholecalciferol. 19 Vitamin D3 deficiency is linked to a lack of ultraviolet B rays from the sun, use of sun block, increased skin pigmentation, seasonal variation, location of the sun, latitude, aging, and obesity. 23 Metabolism of Vitamin D involves conversion in the liver and the kidneys. Sufferers of chronic diseases such as diabetes, pancreatitis, celiac disease, and diseases taxing the liver and kidneys are at greater risk of Vitamin D deficiency. 19 Vitamin D status is classified as: 25(OH)D deficiency < 20 ng/ml, insufficiency 21-29ng/ml; and a normal level at 30ng/ml. 8 The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults aged 18-70 is 600IU/day and for those over 70, the RDA is 800IU/day. 24 The RDA upper limit for Vitamin D supplementation in adults over 18 years of age is 4000IU/day. 24 The best predictor of Vitamin D status is determined by measuring 25(OH)D3 in the blood. The circulating form of Vitamin D, 25(OH)D3, in the blood exists for approximately 2-3 weeks, thus providing a more accurate serum Vitamin D level than the active form 1,25-(OH)2D3 8 which is only available for measurement for about 2-4 hours. 8 Obesity, Vitamin D, and Type 2 diabetes Mellitus It is believed that Vitamin D may assist in improving glycemic control by improving insulin production and secretion. 20 It is hypothesized that vitamin D may inhibit pancreatic beta cell dysfunction by protecting islet cells from destruction. 7 Preliminary research has found an inverse relationship between Vitamin D status and obesity. 5 Vitamin D deficiency in the obese population offers an intriguing perspective. Vitamin D is fat-soluble, behaves like a hormone, and is sequestered in adipose tissue. 23, 25 It has been hypothesized that the greater the fat mass the greater the Vitamin D deficiency. 5 Obesity, a disease associated in the pathophysiology of T2DM, is a consequence of over nutrition and sedentary life-style in those with a genetic predisposition. 26 Demise of the islet beta cell is said to be caused by over nutrition and inactivity. 27 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia and pancreatic beta cell dysregulation. 4 Commonalities between T2DM and obesity involve systemic vascular inflammation. 28 Over nutrition promotes adipose tissue inflammation and beta cell stress; these cellular responses cause insulin signaling impairment and possible subsequent development of T2DM. 17, 28 Cellular responses in organs stemming from inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. 28 Other contributing factors to this inflammation 28 involve changes in environment, lifestyle, sleep deprivation, and diets low in fiber. Systemic vascular inflammation increases with age and is more pronounced and prolonged in those at risk for T2DM. 28 Vitamin D activity in the beta cells is potentiated by the activation of Vitamin D receptors (VDR) located in the pancreas, this in turn allows for a reduction in systemic inflammation. 29 The global increase in obesity and the possible relationship to VDD may present a unique opportunity to impact T2DM at the onset. 5 Current medications such as Byetta and Victoza, which affect both glycemic control and obesity, may present obstacles to treatment such as unfavorable side effects like nausea, emesis, headache, diarrhea 30,31 and a potential risk for pancreatitis, 30 renal insufficiency, 30 and/or thyroid tumor. 31 In a commentary on the link between Vitamin D deficiency and T2DM, the reviewer reports that Vitamin D depletion may have dose related effects on glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, and insulin resistance. 32 Vitamin D supplemented at the higher dose limit 23 may be a less expensive and effective treatment to harness obesity in the T2DM adult. A preliminary search of the Joanna Briggs Library of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Pub Med, and PROSPERO has revealed a number of reviews covering the link between VDD and various disease processes which include T2DM and obesity. Mitri et al. 6 conducted a meta-analysis that included different levels of evidence correlating high levels of Vitamin D with a 43% lower risk of developing T2DM. In 2010, Renzaho et al. 9 conducted a review focusing on VDD and its relation to obesity, T2DM, and/or cardiovascular disease in which they 9 reported that ethnic minorities from various countries had significant VDD. The results also showed an inverse relation between Vitamin D status and obesity; however, the strength of the studies was limited due to the various tools used for determining body fat and not necessarily BMI. 9 A recent review 3 included a mix of multi-level resear fasting glucose. A review conducted by Alvarez et al. 10 also found an inverse relationship between Vitamin D and T2DM; however, dose-dependent glycemic control was not detailed. Another review 11 on the relationship between VDD, obesity, and T2DM found that women who received Vitamin D and Calcium supplementation had less weight gain and smaller waist circumference at a 7 year follow-up versus the placebo group. The results from this were difficult to isolate due to the inclusion of Calcium-Vitamin D supplementation combinations. 11 As there have been several systematic reviews to gain understanding of the relationship between Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, this systematic review will narrow its focus to investigate the effect of Vitamin D in the non-pregnant, obese, VDD adult with T2DM. This review aims to determine what effect vitamin D supplementation has on glycemic control and obesity in the T2DM adult by measurements of HGA1C and BMI, respectively.

AB  - Supplementation during pregnancy forms a vital part of the well-being and development of the unborn child as well as the mother. Very often different brands of over-the-counter vitamins and minerals are taken, without considering the possibility of exceeding the maximum daily allowance, particularly where it concerns fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A. Although many people are aware of the consequences of taking too little vitamin A, this fat-soluble vitamin is stored in the body and over-dosage may occur when taking high doses. In this paper we investigate the effects of hypo- and hypervitaminosis A on craniofacial structures, lungs, hearts, limbs and the kidneys as well as the involvement in foetal nervous system development and post-natal sensorimotor functioning. Furthermore, we discuss how hypo- and hypervitaminosis A may affect the midline and lateral parts of the cerebellum, vermis, flocculi, ganglionic cell layer as well as the suprachiasmatic nucleas of the brain. Changes in the functioning of these areas due to hypo- and hypervitaminosis A, may lead to developmental and learning disabilities involving all forms of motor learning, vestibular functioning, eye and visual system deficits, disrupted sleep rhythms as well as altered mood and emotional processes.

AB  - There is evidence from several prospective studies that stress during pregnancy can affect the behavioural, emotional and cognitive development of the fetus and the child. Animal models suggest that this may be mediated via the HPA axis. Interventions to reduce stress in pregnant women are now a priority. Large prospective studies are providing increasing independent evidence that maternal stress/anxiety during pregnancy can affect fetal brain development, having adverse effects on the child's emotional, behavioural and cognitive development. It is suggested that the function of fetal programming is linked with a predictive adaptive response. Environmental influences on the mother are preparing the child in her womb for the external environment it is likely to inhabit. This is different from the genetic changes and mutations which will be effective for many generations. These affect circadian rhythm including sleep habit, and other aspects including laterality and sexuality. Their seriousness is now well enough established to feature in an American Child Health strategic plan 2005-10. Animal studies have provided a basis for human studies.. Antenatal maternal stress in rats leads to anxiety in the offspring. It can alter laterality -- right-handedness etc -- and sexuality, and disrupt the circadian rhythm including sleep pattern. Prenatal stress reduces the animal's later negative feedback, the calming effect of cortisol, by reducing the cortisol receptors in the hippocampus. In monkeys likewise, maternal prenatal stress leaves the offspring with a lower attention span and more anxiety. There are greater cortisol responses, and imaging also reveals more dopamine receptors to be affected by that stress neurotransmitter. So there is objective evidence of mammalian prenatal stress effects on offspring. In a group of anxious mothers, a simple arithmetic exercise met with a rise in fetal heart-beat, showing that maternal stress clearly affects the fetus. Dr Glover's human research has made use of the ALSPAC community study program. The strongest effects discerned of maternal prenatal stress on the offspring were on behavioural and emotional problems.. The strength of effect was stronger from stress at 32 weeks prenatally than 18 weeks, and resulted in double the levels of the offspring's hyperactivity, and emotional and conduct disorders. The children of anxious mothers in late pregnancy had high waking level of cortisol. In a separate study her group has shown that prenatal stress can affect the child's cognitive development also. In this study it was stress due to relationship problems with the partner, particularly emotional cruelty and separation, which had the largest effect on the child. Studies show that stress acts on the hypothalamus to produce corticotrophin releasing hormone, which in turn acts on the pituitary gland to produce adreno-corticotrophic hormone. This stimulates the adrenal gland to secrete cortisol for negative feedback to the hippocampus to stabilise the system. Yet both maternal and fetal cortisol are a positive stimulus on placental CRH. These results suggest the importance of detecting and treating affective disorder and relationship stress during pregnancy, both for the direct benefit to the mother herself, and particularly to help reduce later development of behavioural and other problems in children.

AB  - Severity of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is classified in five stages according to Quintero staging. However, the efficacy of such staging was recently debated. We reviewed the efficacy of Quintero staging to predict survival rate in TTTS treated with laser therapy. Articles reporting survival rate for each stage in TTTS treated with laser therapy were reviewed. Number of twins alive per pregnancy (NAP) was compared between early (I + II) and advanced (III + IV) stages and within stages. Meta-analysis was performed according to Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Heterogeneity was tested with chi-square for heterogeneity at a significance level of P < 0.10, and random or fixed models were generated as appropriate. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. NAP was similar between early (zero survivors: 34/228, 15%; one survivor: 49/228, 21%; two survivors: 145/228, 63%) and advanced stages (zero survivors: 38/214, 18%; one survivor: 64/214, 30%; two survivors: 112/214, 52%; P > 0.05) except for one survivor ( P < 0.05). A trend for increased NAP was observed in all stages. Because clinically relevant differences were not observed, laser therapy is the optimal treatment for all stages. As Quintero staging does not provide information about prognosis, a new staging system is proposed.

AB  - Introduction: temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is characterized by pain in temporomandibular joint (TMJ), limited range of motion of the jaw and neck, tinnitus, joint noises, strength defi cits, fatigue and muscle pain, headaches and presence of parafunctional habits. Manual therapy aims, through techniques of manipulation, mobilization and specific exercises, to stimulate proprioception, to produce elasticity to adhered fibers, to stimulate synovial fluid and to promote the reduction of pain. Objective: to analyze the effects of manual therapy in the temporomandibular disorder. Method: review of the literature published between 2000 and 2010 in the databases Elsevier, Scielo and Bireme using the descriptors manual therapy, mobilization, manipulation and temporomandibular joint. It were excluded the articles that mentionated the treatment of patients with previous or current history of cancer, severe heart disease, epilepsy or pregnancy. Sample of 27 articles. Results: the articles reported positive effects in reducing pain, improving mobility, psychological aspects, sleep, ears symptoms, chewing and speaking. Although favourable results have been found, a limiting factor in these studies of manual therapy is the lack of detailed description of the techniques used given that the terms manual therapy, mobilization and manipulation are generic and may include different forms of passive movement. Conclusion: the physical therapy intervention by techniques of manual therapy was effective in the treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders, in the pain relief and improved the quality of life of the parients. New studies are suggested about the effects related to different techniques of manual therapy used to treat these disorders.

AB  - Introduction The Maternal Infant Health Outreach Worker (MIHOW) program is a home visiting program, utilizing peer mentors to improve maternal/child health outcomes in underserved communities. Findings are presented from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of the MIHOW model in a sample of Hispanic women in Tennessee. We hypothesized maternal and infant outcomes would be better in women assigned to MIHOW than women assigned to the minimal education intervention (MEI) group (receipt of educational materials). Methods Women entered the study during pregnancy (< 26 weeks gestation) and were followed through 6 months postpartum. A total of 188 women were enrolled and randomly assigned (MEI = 94; MIHOW = 94), with 178 women completing the study (MEI = 87; MIHOW = 91). Results Positive and statistically significant (p < 0.01) effects of MIHOW were observed on breastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusivity, levels of depressive symptoms and parenting stress, safe sleep practices, and infant stimulation in the home. No statistically significant differences were noted in number of prenatal visits. Discussion Results expand limited empiric evidence and provide strong support of the effectiveness of MIHOW on improving health outcomes in this sample of Hispanic mothers and their infants. MIHOW is a viable option for providing culturally sensitive services to immigrant and underserved families.

AB  - The purpose of this exploratory study was to answer the question: 'What is the experience of mothers and fathers with their premature infant in the family home?' The purposive sample consisted of matched sets of mothers and fathers in ten families who were mother and father living together in a committed relationship, whether married or not; over the age of 18 years; and who were English speaking; parent of infant born between 32 and 37 weeks gestation who was hospitalized between one and three weeks, having no obvious birth defects; at discharge requiring no more than 1-2 medications, and no supplemental oxygen.This was an exploratory study using methods of naturalistic inquiry described by Lincoln and Guba (1985). The ongoing process of Finding the Rhythm in Our New Family emerged from data analysis. This process permeated the experience beginning with the disruption brought on by the early birth. In the three to five weeks following the discharge of the premature infant from the NICU, the process continued with mothers and fathers identifying patterns in their family, constructing routines and beginning reconnection with family, friends and the outside world. The eight themes contributing to the process are: Feeling the disruption; Riding the emotional roller coaster, Seeing myself as parent; feeling the part; Figuring out the (premature) baby; Surviving on combat sleep; Evolving as a parenting couple; I left the NICU, has the NICU left me?; Reconnecting with life within and outside the family. The mothers and fathers in this study experienced the process in different ways and were at different places in relation to their identification of the rhythms of their new family. The findings reveal what parents experience in living at home with premature infants generally considered 'healthy' by clinicians. The findings related to process and themes are foundational for future research. Future studies could have as primary focus: parents' experience of GE reflux; the apnea monitor at home; surviving on combat sleep or more in-depth study of the experience of fathers.

AB  - Background: Research shows that obesity prevention has to start early. Targeting interventions towards subgroups of individuals who are predisposed, but yet normal weight, may prove more effective in preventing overweight than interventions towards unselected normal weight subsets. Finally, interventions focused on other factors than diet and activity are lacking. The objectives were to perform a randomized, controlled intervention aiming at preventing overweight in children aged 2-6 years, who are yet normal weight, but have high predisposition for future overweight, and to intervene not only by improving diet and physical activity, but also reduce stress and improve sleep quality and quantity.Methods/design: Based on information from the Danish National Birth Registry and administrative birth forms, children were selected based on having either a high birth weight, a mother who was overweight prior to pregnancy, or a familial low socioeconomic status. Selected children (n = 5,902) were randomized into three groups; an intervention group, a shadow control group followed in registers exclusively, and a control group examined at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Approximately 21% agreed to participate. Children who presented as overweight prior to the intervention were excluded from this study (n = 92). In the intervention group, 271 children were included, and in the control group 272 were included. Information obtained from the shadow control group is on-going, but it is estimated that 394 children will be included. The intervention took place over on average 1½ year between 2009 and 2011, and consisted of optional individual guidance in optimizing diet and physical activity habits, reducing chronic stress and stressful events and improving sleep quality and quantity. The intervention also included participation in cooking classes and play arrangements. Information on dietary intake, meal habits, physical activity, sleep habits, and overall stress level was obtained by 4-7 day questionnaire diaries and objective measurements.Discussion: If the Healthy Start project is effective in preventing excessive weight gain, it will provide valuable information on new determinants of obesity which should be considered in future interventions, and on new strategies to prevent development of overweight and obesity at an early age.

AB  - A descriptive design was used to explore the psychological aspects of the antepartal hospitalization experience for preterm labor patients. Patient's perceptions of stressors and supports during hospitalization were assessed. A convenience sample of 30 multigravida women were used for the study sample. Patients hospitalized a minimum of four days or more participated in a semi-structured interview to assess their perceptions. A modified Sarason Life Experience Survey (LES) and a Jalowiec Coping Scale (JCS), was administered following the interviews. Quantitative methods for analysis of the demographic, LES, and JCS data were done using descriptive statistics. Qualitative analysis of the audiotaped interviews were performed using the naturalistic paradigm. These hospitalized women reported people, events and issues as stressors. Critical areas identified were: environmental confinement, difficulty in interpersonal communications, loss of control, isolation and loss of the parental role. The primary means of support reported by these hospitalized women were people. Interactions and relationships that these women had with their immediate family and friends provided this support. Care given by the nurses and doctors in stabilizing the patient's medical condition and maintaining the pregnancy was critical. A greater number of negative life events than positive were identified in these women. Negative life events with the greatest impact were: change in sleep habits, recreation, other events, and social activities. Coping styles utilized and found most effective were Supportant, Optimistic, and Confrontive. Coping styles used less and found least effective were Fatalistic, Evasive, and Emotive. The relationships between stressful life events and coping styles used during hospitalization demonstrated that not all subjects utilized multiple support systems along with problem solving behaviors to cope with the stress of hospitalization. Younger women reported more stressful life events and used different coping styles than the older women. Demographic variables of race, religion, education, and occupation also affected the use and effectiveness of coping styles. Results of this study support the idea that high risk multigravida women experience a variety of stressors and supports during antepartal hospitalization. The number of stressful life events varies along with the individual adaptive response to these stressors.

AB  - Objective: To assess the level of recognition and knowledge about treatment of depression by General Practitioners (GPs). Method: Analysis of questionnaires completed by participants commencing a series of workshops aimed at improving their knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of depression. Of the 3289 GPs involved in the program 2500 (76% respondent rate) completed the questionnaires in a group situation. There was no difference between respondents and nonrespondents in terms of age, gender and year of graduation. Results: The majority of GPs believe they have a satisfactory competence in the recognition and treatment of depression, although a sizeable minority based their diagnosis predominantly on somatic symptoms. The GPs felt confident about their knowledge and skills in counselling and the use of antidepressant medication, but not in dealing with children and suicidal or pregnant patients. The most common symptoms used to identify 'depression' were sleep disorders and only 54% listed depressed mood as a symptom on which the diagnosis is based. Only 28% reported sufficient symptoms to meet criteria for DSM-IV major depressive disorder, which supports views that these criteria are inappropriate for general practice. Fifty-seven percent of doctors used medicine together with nonpharmacological treatment in the majority of patients, and medications doses were almost all within the range recommended in the product information. Conclusions: There is a need to improve GPs knowledge in diagnosing depression, in child psychiatry and in dealing with pregnant and suicidal patients.

AB  - RATIONALE: Psychological factors are acknowledged to impact on pregnancy, birth, neonatal outcomes and maternal mental health. The importance of psychological well-being is now recognized within maternity care and UK maternity policy advocates choice and control, equating this to increased quality of experience and improved psychological outcomes. There remains, however, lack of substantive and consistent evidence with regard to the psychological benefits of choice in maternity care. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of choice of maternity care on psychological health outcomes. METHODS: 165 antenatal women were recruited and sampled according to their choices for care. Women were assessed utilizing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC), SF-36, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Culture Free Self-esteem Inventory (CFSEI) at 12 and 32 weeks pregnant and 14 days and 6 months postnatal. RESULTS: No significant differences between groups were revealed on any of the scales or subscales measured. Significant and corresponding differences were identified within groups over time for CWS socio-medical worries, MHLC 'powerful others', SF-36 bodily pain, vitality personal health and change in health, PSQI global sleep. An interaction effect for CFSEI general and social self-esteem was revealed between birth centre and midwifery-led care/main unit women at 14 days postnatal. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that pregnancy represents a psychological challenge regardless of care type chosen and choice of no one care option confers greater psychological benefit across the maternity experience as a whole. It is possible, however, that differences in experience or environment at critical times can affect psychological status.

AB  - Mothers may attribute infant behaviors of regurgitation, irritability or crying, or sleep disturbances to gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). There is a heightened risk for this attribution when an infant is born preterm. GER/GERD has been associated with maternal anxiety and depression that may negatively affect the maternal-infant relationship.The study was a secondary data analysis. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of maternal perception that her infant has symptoms of GER/GERD on maternal-infant interaction. The study also explored the influence of GER/GERD on maternal anxiety. A non-experimental comparative design was utilized with a convenience sample of 64 mothers and their healthy growing premature infants who were recruited at 32 weeks gestation. Review of home visit records as well as personal interviews revealed three attribution groupings: mother with no concerns and infant had no symptoms, mother attributed infant symptoms to GER/GERD but she was not concerned, and mother attributed infant symptoms to GER/GERD, was concerned, and sought medical attention. Child and maternal contingency scores were obtained with the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS) when infants were 6 months of age. Anxiety was measured with the State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI).MANOVA revealed no statistically significant difference in the mother-infant interaction among the 3 attribution groups, even when taking into account maternal anxiety and depression scores. There was not a statistically significant difference in maternal anxiety between groups.Results suggest that having an infant with behaviors attributed to GER/GERD does not negatively affect the mother infant relationship at 6 months. A limitation of this study was the small sample size and the lack of conformity of the three attribution groups in terms of demographic factors, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, that have been shown in other research to influence the mother-infant interaction.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature surrounding women's psychological health in pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal periods. The content will provide clinically useful information to midwives and health care professionals involved in caring for women during the antenatal, intranatal and postnatal periods. The impact of psychological health status in pregnancy on clinical outcomes such as preterm labour, pre-eclampsia, epidural use, caesarean section, instrumental deliveries and increased rates of admission to neonatal intensive care, alongside the cognitive and social development of the infant and child are well documented. Less research to date has considered the impact of psychological well-being on the mother throughout pregnancy, the peripartum, postpartum and beyond. Psychological status for these women has traditionally been characterised by anxiety and depression, largely ignoring the complex psychological interrelations that characterise pregnancy. Psychological status in pregnancy cannot be defined within a unidimensional framework but must include a comprehensive assessment of all the dimensions that attribute to mood and emotional status for women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. This paper intends to address the constructs of anxiety and depression, worry, control, quality of life, sleep and self-esteem. Screening for, and identification of, maternal psychological distress from a multidimensional perspective enables healthcare professionals to recognise and acknowledge normal and abnormal adjustment and offer interventions, strategies and support to facilitate a woman's transition to motherhood.

AB  - Objective: Postpartum depression (PPD) is an important health issue that affects not only mothers, but also entire families, Postpartum follow-up should address emotional and psychological issues, as well as physical issues, especially in those at risk. This study aimed to determine the incidence of PPD and the associated risk factors in a group of new mothers undergoing routine follow-up at an urban maternity clinic. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study investigating the relationship between PPD and various factors. A total of 187 women that presented to a university hospital for routine postpartum follow-up 4-6 weeks post delivery were recruited consecutively. The mothers were administered a sociodemographic form that included questions about the known risk factors (sociodemographic and sociocultural factors, and mother-related, pregnancy-related, and child-related factors) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: The incidence of PPD based on EPDS scores was 28.9% (scores > 12 were defined as PPD). Unplanned/unintended pregnancy, bottle-feeding only, mother's lack of satisfaction with the baby's sleep pattern, lack of family support for baby care, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were significantly correlated with PPD (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression showed that bottle-feeding, lack of family support, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were the primary factors that significantly increased the risk of PPD. Conclusions: The findings show that the PPD occurs in almost one-third of women and that, among the risk factors, sociocultural factors were the most strongly associated with PPD.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe selected biopsychosocial factors (sleep quality, self-efficacy for childbirth, and anxiety) in nulliparous women during the late third trimester and relate them to perception and performance (pain, fatigue, coping strategies, and time spent at home) in labor prior to hospitalization, as well as to eventual obstetric outcomes (cervical status on admission, oxytocin use, type of delivery, anesthesia use, and neonatal APGAR scores). This study was a descriptive, longitudinal, correlational study of the relationships among these variables.Participants were 35 English-speaking nulliparous women, ages 18 to 40, 38 weeks of completed gestation or greater, with uncomplicated pregnancies. In addition, all subjects were partnered and enrolled in childbirth education programs.At enrollment, Spielbergers Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to evaluate trait anxiety, while the Prenatal Self-Evaluation Questionnaire measured childbirth-specific anxiety. Self-efficacy for childbirth was measured with the Self-Efficacy for Childbirth Inventory. Antepartum sleep disturbance was measured over the last five nights of pregnancy using the wrist actigraph (MiniMotionlogger). Pain and fatigue in early labor at home were evaluated with the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form and the Visual Analogue Scale of Fatigue Severity. A combination of medical records review and postpartum audiotaped interviews provided information about the remaining pre-hospitalization and birth variables.Data analysis demonstrated significant relationships between: anxiety and self-efficacy for childbirth in late pregnancy (r = -.59, p < 0.01), total sleep time on the night before birth (TST-1) and pain in early labor (r = -.47, p < 0.05), numbers of cognitive coping strategies used and pain scores in early labor (r = -.47, p < 0.04), and the number of hours at home in labor and admitting cervical dilation (r =.70, p < 0.001). Subject-reported components of pre-hospitalization labor included: recognition of labor onset, management of signs, symptoms, and emotions of early labor, and decision to admit to the hospital. Women employed behavioral and cognitive strategies to manage these components. Sleep parameters of women approaching childbirth revealed a pattern of increasing sleep disturbance. TST-1 diminished significantly from TST-345 (t = 5.95, p < 0.001).

AB  - Background: In utero exposure to smoking is known to adversely affect brain regions involved in behavioral state organization and could therefore interact with the neurophysiological development of neonates.Study Objectives: The present study investigated the effects of prenatal smoking exposure on sleep patterns in the preterm neonate.Design: Overnight sleep patterns were polysomnographically assessed at thermoneutrality. Sleep continuity and structure were scored for the respective frequencies, durations and percentages of active, quiet, and indeterminate sleep and wakefulness after sleep onset. The number and duration of body movements were also analyzed.Setting: The neonatal intensive care unit at Amiens University Medical Center (France).Participants: Healthy preterm neonates (postconceptional age: 33.9 +/- 6.0 weeks) were enrolled according to whether their mothers had not smoked at all during pregnancy (control group, n = 19), smoked less during pregnancy (low-smoking group, S[low], n = 10), or smoked more (heavy-smoking group, S[heavy], n = 10) than 10 cigarettes per day throughout pregnancy.Measurements and Results: Neonates born to heavy-smoking mothers had a significantly lower mean birth weight than controls (-21%) and displayed disrupted sleep structure and continuity: they slept less overall (with a higher proportion of active sleep and a lower proportion of quiet sleep) and had more wakefulness after sleep onset. Compared with controls, neonates from both smoking groups displayed more body movements and, as a result, more disturbed sleep.Conclusions: High prenatal smoking exposure modifies sleep patterns in preterm neonates by disrupting sleep organization and increasing nocturnal body movements. These findings raise the question of the repercussions of these sleep disturbances (at what is a critical stage in brain development) on the child's physiological and neurobehavioral outcomes.

AB  - Introduction Sleep is a physiological state of self-regulation. The international classification of sleep disorders now includes as a new category those occurring during pregnancy. Regular physical activity is known to improve the quality of life, one aspect of which is sleep quality. During pregnancy, physical activity is decreased but should not be eliminated, as studies have reported a high correlation between sleep disorders and the absence of physical activity. Regular physical exercise during pregnancy, whether performed in water or out of it, provides greater control of gestational weight gain. Furthermore, the reduced weight gain during pregnancy, as a result of physical exercise, is associated with greater physical resistance to the demands of childbirth, combats the fatigue caused by pregnancy and reduces back pain. All of these outcomes tend to enhance sleep quality, among other beneficial effects. Objective To determine whether, in pregnant women, there is an association between moderate-intensity physical activity in an aquatic environment and sleep quality. Material and methods A randomised clinical trial was conducted with a sample of 140 pregnant women aged 21–43 years, divided into two groups; Intervention Group and Control Group. The women were recruited in the twelfth week of gestation and took part in the [Study of] Water Exercise in Pregnancy programme from week 20 to week 37. Sleep quality was evaluated in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy, using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. Results The Mann–Whitney U test showed that the results obtained were statistically significant (p < 0.05). In the Intervention Group, 44 of the women (65.67%) were classified as “poor sleepers” versus 62 women (92.54%) in the Control Group. Conclusions The [Study of] Water Exercise in Pregnancy method improves the quality of sleep in pregnant women, both subjectively and in terms of latency, duration and efficiency.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Post-partum weight retention (PWR) has been identified as a critical pathway for long-term overweight and obesity. In recent years, psychological factors have been demonstrated to play a key role in contributing to and maintaining PWR. DESIGN: Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between post-partum psychological distress and PWR at 9 months, after controlling for maternal weight factors, sleep quality, sociocontextual influences, and maternal behaviours. METHOD: Pregnant women (N = 126) completed a series of questionnaires at multiple time points from early pregnancy until 9 months post-partum. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression indicated that gestational weight gain, shorter duration (6 months or less) of breastfeeding, and post-partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months are associated with higher PWR at 9 months; stress, depression, and anxiety had minimal influence. CONCLUSION: Interventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should specifically target the prevention of body dissatisfaction and excessive weight gain during pregnancy. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? Post-partum weight retention (PWR) is a critical pathway for long-term overweight and obesity. Causes of PWR are complex and multifactorial. There is increasing evidence that psychological factors play a key role in predicting high PWR. What does this study add? Post-partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months is associated with PWR at 9 months post-birth. Post-partum depression, stress and anxiety have less influence on PWR at 9 months. Interventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should target body dissatisfaction.

However, the temporal inter-relationship between these variables has yet to be investigated.Method:Data were collected from 150 expectant couples at approximately 18, 25 and 33 weeks’ gestation.Results:After accounting for the relative stability of depression, anxiety and stress over time, for men higher levels of anxiety earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depression and stress in middle pregnancy, which predicted higher depression during late pregnancy. A similar relationship remained after partialling out the effects of partner’s depression, perceived social support and sleep quality. Further analyses also revealed significant differences in the manifestation of distress symptoms between men and women, but not between first-time and non-first-time fathers.Conclusion:Our findings indicated a possible inter-relationship between depression, anxiety and stress for men antenatally. Our findings also showed that men who reported elevated depression, anxiety and stress earlier in the antenatal period also reported elevated symptomology at later time points. Finally, the current findings revealed that antenatal paternal stress may play a key role in the development of depression and anxiety later in pregnancy. Therefore, it may be important to screen for early levels of antenatal stress in men, as well as depression and anxiety.
