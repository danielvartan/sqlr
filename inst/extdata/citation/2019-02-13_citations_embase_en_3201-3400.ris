N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine the number of days of diary data collection needed to reliably measure mother and infant sleep-wake pattern. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty healthy adult mothers and their healthy term gestation infants age 4 to 10 weeks postnatal participated in a single group, cross-sectional design. Mothers completed a paper and pencil sleep-wake diary divided into 15-minute time periods. Data were collected in the home environment over a 4-day period. Mother and infant sleep and wake as well as infant feeding and cry were summarized and compared using between 1 and 4 days of data. Reliability was evaluated by correlating results obtained using from 1 to 4 days of data. RESULTS: Mean values for mother and infant sleep and activity variables did not differ significantly by day. Correlation among values calculated using increases in number of days of data showed adequate reliability (r > or = 0.80) when 3 days of data were used. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Clinical measures should be valid and reliable. Due to day-to-day changes in maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern, a diary collected over 1 day may not provide adequate sleep information. These study findings indicate that 3 days of diary data are sufficient to reliably measure mother and infant sleep patterns. When using a diary to assess maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern in clinical practice or in clinically-based research, a 3-day period is suggested.

N2  - Background: Impairment of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC) is associated with the glutamate accumulation, ROS production and neurodegeneration including Alzheimer disease and Wernike-Korsak-of f syndrom. We showed that in neuronal cultures synthetic regulators of OGDHC are neuroprotective, reducing the glutamate excitotoxicity and excessive ROS. Here, we check physiological action of such regulator, succi-nyl phosphonate (SP), in rats stressed by hypoxia or ethanol, the known inducers of neurodegeneration. Methods: Normal or pregnancy-sensitized female rats experienced acute hypoxia in a decompression chamber with the atmospheric pressure decreased to 145 mm Hg. Alcohol treatment was performed on males by injections of 4.5 g/kg ethanol i.p. Intranasal application of SP in SP-treated groups or physiologic solution in reference groups was done 45-50 min before the hypoxia or ethanol exposure. Direct and delayed effects were determined within hours and the next day after treatments, respectively. The behavioral parameters were quantified in the open field, closed plus maze and light-dark chamber tests. Results: Behavior of control animals was generally not affected by SP. SP increased exploratory activity in males (by 40%, p=0.05) and emotional strain in pregnant females (2-fold, p<0.05), with the latter effect preserved upon SP+hypoxia treatment. Behavioral impact of acute hypoxia was not pronounced, but sensitized by pregnancy. Low resistant pregnant rats tended to increase their hypoxia resistance after SP pretreatment which shifted the median time before collapsing from 129 to 178 s. 24H after, an increase in horizontal moving activity of hypoxic pregnant rats (by 13%, p<0.05) was abrogated in SP+hypoxia group. Ethanol caused much more prof ound behavioral changes. Compared to the ethanol-exposed males, combined SP+ethanol treatment dose-depen-dently increased the alcohol-induced narcotic sleep (by up to 80%, p<0.05) and depression of the motor and exploratory activity 4H after awakening (11 parameters changed, p< 0.01). These direct SP effects were followed by a better normalization of functions in 24H. The SP+ethanol group exhibited decreased hyperactivity (by 31%, p<0.05), decreased anxiety index (by 22%, p< 0.02) and increased activity in light (4-fold, p< 0.05) versus the ethanol-treated males which remained significantly stressed. Conclusions: Metabolic depression through the OGDHC inhibition by SP in vivo protects from behavioral stress induced by hypoxia or ethanol.

N2  - Background: Previous studies have demonstrated individual differences in susceptibility to the detrimental effects of prenatal ethanol exposure. Many factors, including genetic differences, have been shown to play a role in susceptibility and resistance, but few studies have investigated the range of genetic variation in rodent models. Methods: We examined ethanol teratogenesis in 5 inbred strains of mice: C57BL/6J (B6), Inbred Short-Sleep, C3H/Ibg, A/Ibg, and 129S6/SvEvTac (129). Pregnant dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin (MD) on day 9 of pregnancy. Dams were sacrificed on day 18 and fetuses were weighed, sexed, and examined for gross morphological malformations. Every other fetus within a litter was then either placed in Bouin's fixative for subsequent soft-tissue analyses or eviscerated and placed in ethanol for subsequent skeletal analyses. Results: B6 mice exposed to ethanol in utero had fetal weight deficits and digit, kidney, brain ventricle, and vertebral malformations. In contrast, 129 mice showed no teratogenesis. The remaining strains showed varying degrees of teratogenesis. Conclusions: Differences among inbred strains demonstrate genetic variation in the teratogenic effects of ethanol. Identifying susceptible and resistant strains allows future studies to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying prenatal alcohol phenotypes. © 2009 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.

N2  - Objective. The Alaska Division of Public Health has stated that infants may safely share a bed for sleeping if this occurs with a nonsmoking, unimpaired caregiver on a standard, adult, non-water mattress. Because this policy is contrary to recent national recommendations that discourage any bed sharing, we examined 13 years of Alaskan infant deaths that occurred while bed sharing to assess the contribution of known risk factors. Methods. We examined vital records, medical records, autopsy reports, and first responder reports for 93% of Alaskan infant deaths that occurred between 1992 and 2004. We examined deaths while bed sharing for risk factors including sleeping with a non-caregiver, prone position, maternal tobacco use, impairment of a bed-sharing partner, and an unsafe sleep surface. We used Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data to describe bed-sharing practices among all live births in Alaska during 1996-2003. Results. Thirteen percent (n=126) of deaths occurred while bed sharing; 99% of these had at least one associated risk factor, including maternal tobacco use (75%) and sleeping with an impaired person (43%). Frequent bed sharing was reported for 38% of Alaskan infants. Among these, 60% of mothers reported no risk factors; the remaining 40% reported substance use, smoking, high levels of alcohol use, or most often placing their infant prone for sleeping. Conclusions. Almost all bed-sharing deaths occurred in association with other risk factors despite the finding that most women reporting frequent bed sharing had no risk factors; this suggests that bed sharing alone does not increase the risk of infant death. ©2009 Association of Schools of Public Health.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to smoking and alcohol increases the risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Physiological changes associated with these exposures are not well studied. Full-term infants were tested within the first 3 days of life. We hypothesized that maternal alcohol consumption and/or smoking during pregnancy would alter autonomic nervous system function. Newborns whose mothers smoked during pregnancy had lower beat-to-beat heart rate variability in quiet sleep. Infants whose mothers consumed alcohol had lower global heart rate variability, but only in active sleep. Unexposed infants demonstrated increases in heart rate with head-up tilt and decreases in heart rate with head-down tilt, but smoking and alcohol-exposed infants showed no significant responses. These results indicate that autonomic function is altered by prenatal exposure to alcohol and smoking. Such markers may provide early identification of infants at greatest risk for SIDS. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Objectives: To describe different sleep disorders and daytime sleepiness in a French population of randomly selected young women during pregnancy and to evaluate the frequency of these sleep disorders according to the three trimesters of pregnancy. Methods: Cross-sectional design with retrospective survey of pre-pregnancy, symptoms and prospective survey of current symptoms. Mothers were interviewed during pregnancy with a questionnaire to evaluate their sleep before pregnancy and to assess alterations in their sleep according to the trimester. Results: 871 pregnant women completed the questionnaire. The rate of pregnant women with insomnia with non-refreshing sleep and frequent awakenings increases during the second and the third trimester reaching more than 75% of the women, essentially due to an urge to urinate, movements of the fetus, backache and restless legs syndrome. Snoring also increases throughout the pregnancy with more than 18% of them snoring every night. Conversely, more than 75% of the women complained of a decrease in their vigilance and a need to nap inreased during the pregnancy. Conclusions: The subjective quality of sleep is disturbed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy and increases throughout the pregnancy, except for excessive daytime sleepiness which was more frequent during the first trimester. © 2009 S.

N2  - Possible prevention of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure has been investigated using peptides that were previously shown to be involved in neuroprotection both in vitro and in vivo. We focused in this study on investigating the neuroprotective effects of two derived peptides with regards to the determination of the signaling pathways involved in neuroprotection. One peptide with the sequence NAPV-SIPQ, known as NAP, a fragment of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, and the other demonstrated a potent protective effect against oxidative stress associated with alcohol exposure. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched pregnant females were assigned the following groups: (1) Ethanol liquid diet group (ALC) 25% (4.49%, v/v) ethanol derived calories, (2) Pair-fed (PF) control group (3) Chow control group, (4) treatment groups with alcohol alongside i.p. injections of D-NAP (ALC/D-NAP, 20 or 30 μg/20 g body weight), (5) PF/D-NAP control group. On E13, fetal brains were collected and assayed for TUNEL-staining, caspase-3 colorimetric assay and ELISA for cytochrome c and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) detection. Our results show that NAP significantly prevented alcohol-induced weight reduction of the fetal brain. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP administration significantly prevented alcohol-induced increases in TUNEL-positive cells in primordium cingulate cortex and basal ganglia eminence. The investigation of downstream signaling pathways involving NAP neuroprotection revealed that this peptide significantly prevented alcohol-induced increase in the concentrations of caspase-3 in E13 fetal brains. Moreover, ELISA for cytochrome c shows that NAP significantly prevented both alcohol-induced increases in the level of cytosolic cytochrome c and alcohol-induced decreases in the level of mitochondrial cytochrome c. Importantly, analysis of proteins in the upstream signaling pathway revealed that NAP down-regulated the phosphorylation of JNK These data provide an understanding of NAP intracellular target, and the signaling mechanisms of action that will pave a path toward potential therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during prenatal stages.

N2  - Recent studies suggest the possibility that the sleep-wake disturbances and neuroendocrine function abnormalities in fetal alcohol-exposed (FAE) offspring are related to long-term changes in circadian clock mechanisms. We have previously shown that fetal alcohol exposure altered the circadian expression of the beta-endorphin precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene in the arcuate nucleus (ARN) and the clock-governing rPerl and rPer2 genes in the SCN and ARN. To determine whether cAMP and melatonin signal pathways are involved in ethanol's modification of circadian POMC functions in FAE offspring, we measured the circadian changes in mRNA levels of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and melatonin receptor 1 (MTR1) in SCN tissues and laser-captured POMC neurons in the hypothalamus. Pregnant dams between Days 7 and 18 of gestation were fed a liquid diet containing ethanol (FAE), pair-fed a control liquid diet (pair-fed) or fed rat chow ad libitum (ad-lib). Male offspring were sacrificed at 90 d of age at 4-h intervals throughout the day. In both the SCN and POMC neurons of ad-lib and pair-fed rats, the mRNA levels of CREB displayed robust circadian variations with a peak during the night, but in FAE rats the levels of CREB mRNA were expressed in a fragmented fashion and without a distinctive peak. In ad-lib and pair-fed offspring, MTR1 mRNA levels showed elevated expression in the SCN during the light-dark transition, but in the POMC neuron they were elevated during the daytime. The circadian expression of MTR1 in FAE offspring was significantly reduced, however. These data suggest that the fetal alcohol exposure-induced changes in circadian POMC neuronal functions might involve melatonin receptors and cAMP signaling.

N2  - Introduction: Three retrospective studies suggested a high frequency (11-26%) of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy. None of these studies used standardized methods for assessment of RLS and sleep. Characteristics and determinants of RLS during pregnancy are poorly known. Methods: Women during (from the second trimester, 1x/month) and after pregnancy (8 weeks post-partum) are prospectively studied. Assessment includes (1) interview about RLS-symptoms and sleep habits/disturbances: (2) standardized questionnaires (incl. the international RLS-scale (IRLSS), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI)); (3) blood tests (incl. hemoglobin, C-reactive protein and ferritin), (4) leg actigraphy (3rd trimester and post-partum). Results: So far 340 women were screened. RLS was diagnosed in 35 women (10.3%), 24 participated in the study so far. 28% of them had a positive family history for RLS, 60% reported onset of RLS-symptoms before the 20th week, 60% had RLS-symptoms daily, 60% had an IRLSS>20, and 85% had a PSQI>5. Anemia (defined as Hb <11 g/dl in pregnant women) was found in 10% of affected and unaffected women. Ferritin levels <50 were found in 88% of women. Women with (pRLS) and without RLS (nRLS) had similar values in hemoglobin CRP, and ferritin (mean Hb 11.8 mg/dl in pRLS, 12 mg/dl in nRLS; Ferritin 19.1 ìg/l in pRLS, 13.3 in nRLS). Conclusion: Preliminary results of this ongoing study suggest that RLS in pregnancy: (1) is present in 10% of women; (2) frequently appears early in pregnancy; (3) is often severe/frequent; (4) may not be related (only) to anemia/low ferritin levels; (5) has a significant impact on sleep quality.

N2  - The management of bipolar disorder in pregnancy and the postpartum period is a challenge. It is balancing the benefits with the risks of treatment versus no treatment for both mother and fetus. Ten bipolar patients have been followed during pregnancy and the postpartum period. We describe the course of the bipolar disorder during this period. The postpartum period has our special interest, as it is associated with a high risk for recurrence of bipolar disorder. Sleep disturbance is associated with a high risk for recurrence of bipolar disorder. The literature about this subject has been studied and will be (shortly) reviewed. An overview is presented of the many risk factors concerning bipolar disorder and relapse in the postpartum period. Many studies inventoried the risk factors for relapse in the postpartum period. Sleep disturbance durante parte has been named as a possible risk factor for relapse in the postpartum period. We are about to start a prospective study on pregnant women with bipolar disorder to investigate whether prevention of sleep disturbance could diminish relapse in the postpartum period.

N2  - Background and Goal of Study: Chronopharmacology is related to biological time's interaction and drug administration. There is a temporal change of pain and it seems to have important clinical implications in labour's pain treatment. The aim of our retrospective study is to determine if the time when epidural analgesia is performed, time of the first administration of ropivacaíne (with daylight/in night time), influences the duration of labour's analgesia. Materials and Methods: This is an observacional study of 252 pregnant women clinical records in the first stage of labour. Inclusion criteria were: ASA 1,2, nulliparous women, of singleton vertex pregnancy, who presented up to 4 cms of cervical dilatation, which were managed with epidural analgesia using ropivacaine, according to protocol of the institution, during the months of June, July and August. We divided these women in two main groups: the A group (clear phase-06h31m/20h29m), and B group (dark phase-20h30m/06h30m), according to the first epidural administration time of ropivacaíne. We evaluated the duration of the effect until the second administration, for each group. The data had been worked in Excel. Results and Discussion: Our findings show for the A group a ropivacaine duration of action of 179,80 ± 8.694 minutes and for the B group 161,80 ± 9.849 minutes. That is a longer effect of ropivacaine's action when given in daytime (±18 minutes longer) rather than in night time. The intraday variation of analgesia duration among the 2 groups reached 14%. Of course, with this design, we have to be careful to drawn definite statistical conclusions since we could not control all variables (anesthetic technique, anesthetic zealous records, and obstetrical practice), but we believe that the biological rhythms are important and should be considered as well the time of injection in the practical anesthesiology. Conclusion(s): The present study suggests a tendency: the hour at which occurs ropivacaíne administration (daytime/night time) may influence duration of the analgesia effect and this should be taken into account when enrolling parturients in comparative studies designed to assess or treat labour pain. Although this is just a tendency (as reported in several international studies), our findings should lead us to go for more definite prospective studies so we can evaluate its statistic significance.

N2  - Introduction: The effects of sleep deprivation on clinical performance and patient safety remains debated within the medical literature.1 Epidural catheter insertion for labour analgesia is an invasive procedure, often performed by a sleep deprived clinician. The aims of this study were to establish valid measures for procedural skills assessment and to use these measures to examine the effects of sleep deprivation on physicians of variable levels of experience at performing labour epidural catheter insertion in the clinical setting. Methods: After IRB approval, anesthesiologists of three levels of experience were recruited: novice residents (< 30 epidurals, n = 9), experienced residents (> 100 epidurals, n = 8), and attending anesthesiologists (> 500 epidurals, n = 9). All participants were measured twice; rested and sleep deprived in random order while performing a labour epidural for analgesia on a parturient. Sleep deprivation was verified by the ActiGraph™ and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Our primary outcome measures were the Imperial College Surgical Assessment Device (ICSAD) [measuring path length, number of movements, and time], task specific checklist (CL), and global rating scale (GRS). Results: Subjects were confirmed as sleep deprived for their sleep deprivation observation by the ActiGraph™ and ESS. Data was analyzed with a two-way mixed design ANOVA. The ICSAD demonstrated that novice residents had longer path lengths when compared with experienced residents (p = .033) and attending anesthesiologists (p = .008). Additionally, they made more movements (p = .013) and took more time than attending anesthesiologists (p = .019). Novice residents scored significantly worse on the GRS when compared with experienced residents (p = .029) and attendings (p = .001) and had significantly lower CL scores when compared with attendings (p = .003). Sleep deprivation did not significantly affect performance in any subject group as measured by the ICSAD (all endpoints p = NS [see Figure]), the CL (p = NS), and GRS (p = NS). Discussion: Construct and concurrent validity for the ICSAD were established for labour epidural catheter insertion by demonstrating that it can distinguish between operators of different levels of experience and by the similarity of the results to the current “gold” standards of procedural skills assessment (CL and GRS). Using all these measures, the performance of this high stakes procedural skill in a clinical setting does not seem to be affected by sleep deprivation irrespective of level of experience.

N2  - Objective. We present the case of 8 years old boy with normal history of pregnancy, birth, postpartal period and psychomotor development until the age of 3 years. At the age of 20 months he experienced fi rst convulsiones (febrile) but 4 months later a febrile seizure occur. Antiepileptic drug was introduced and child was seizure free for next 6 months when seizures relapsed. In the following years the frequency of seizures was changing from cluster with up to 20 seizures per night to seizure free periods lasting weeks or even month. At the age of 5 years he had up to 30 seizures per day. Almost all antiepileptic drugs were given in mono- and polytherapy but with no success. Poor control of the epilepsy was accompanied by retarded speech development, hyperactivity and attention defi cit (ADHD). Methods. Semiology of the seizures occuring mainly during fi rst night sleep sometimes during day describes most often eye deviation to the right side, version to the right, clonic movements of the right corner of the mouth lasting 20 to 30 seconds with a loss of urine. EEG recorded focal discharges over both hemispheres becoming more intensive on the right side. Worsening of the disease manifested with further deterioration in the EEG. High amplitude slow activity appeared in the right frontal region with bilateral focal discharges. Several brain MR scans with spectroscopy showed suspicious prolipherative tumorous lesion in the right frontal lobe. Regarding the suspected tumor patient had two stereotactic biopsies whose histopathology finding revealed cortical dysplasia type IIB. Soon after a partial resection of the lesion took place and the diagnosis was confi rmed. Results. The boy had immediately after surgery only few abortive seizures in the fi rst sleep and was seizure free ten months after. Unfortunately seizures started again with high frequency in spite of antiepileptic therapy. Postoperative MR scan diagnosed the residual parts of cortical dysplasia in the right frontal lobe. Conclusion. With the diagnosis of focal cortical dysplasia type IIB the chance to become seizures free with medication alone is very small and a second resection is recommended. Before performing another surgery seizure onset zone should be identifi ed through prolonged Video and EEG monitoring. High resolution brain MR scan and ictal and interictal SPECT will be done as well as methionine and FDG-PET. The diagnostic results will be requested and discussed with neurosurgeon, pediatric neurologist and radiologist hoping that well tailored second surgery might free the child from epilepsy.

N2  - Background: Cyclic oculomotor paralysis is a very rare disorder of ocular motility in which the third nerve evidences paroxistic modifications, alternating between a spastic and a paralytic phase. Most cases have their onset before age 2. Case report: A baby girl, first daughter of healthy parents had an uneventful gestation and labour. From the first week of age, parents noticed that occasionally she had unequal pupil size. When she was 6-months-old, together with the pupil change, parents noticed that the right lid would sometimes retract. This happened during sleep, eating and playing. At one year of age, the episodes would be more frequent, and sometimes the eye would look down and outward. She had anormal development, and no other changes were detected in general, neurological or ophthalmological examination. Brain MRI and EEG were normal. Now, 2 years of age, she maintains the cyclic phenomenon, independently of the occasion, slightly less frequent according to the parents: initially the right pupil dilates, then ptosis of the eyelid occurs, followed by abduction and infraversion of the eye. Afterwards lid retraction occurs, the eye returns to its position and pupil constricts. Frequent patching of the left eye was recommended to prevent amblyopia. Discussion: Our patient presents the typical oculomotor cyclic spasms. However, unlike most of the reports in literature, she appears to have periods of normal oculomotor function. Of the 47 previous reports, only one was associated with neurologic lesion (supraclinoid aneurysm). In all the other the phenomenon persisted throughout life. Cyclic phenomena are rare in the nervous system, and the underlying mechanism of these cyclic spasms remains a mystery.

N2  - This study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality in late pregnancy and recurrence of postpartum major depression (PPMD) through 28 weeks postpartum. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 36 weeks gestation was assessed in 51 non-depressed women with a history of PPMD; recurrence was determined by the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. Sleep quality in late pregnancy was not related to recurrence per se, but it was related to timing of recurrence (Kruskal-Wallace = 9.78, p = .008). Rapid recurrence (within 4 weeks post delivery) was preceded by fewer sleep complaints (mean PSQI for early recurrers = 4.8 vs. 7.3 for non-recurrers, p = .09). Recurrence after 4 weeks postpartum was preceded by more sleep complaints in late pregnancy (mean PSQI for late recurrers = 9.9 vs. 7.3 for non-recurrers, p = .02). Sleep quality in late pregnancy may help in identifying women at risk for a PPMD recurrence.

N2  - Objective: Down syndrome (DS) affects 1/800 infants. Prenatal NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) (NAP+SAL) prevent developmental delay in Ts65Dn mice, a mouse model of DS. We investigated whether this finding involves N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits. Study Design: Pregnant Ts65Dn mice were treated with placebo or NAP+SAL on gestational days 8-12. After developmental delay prevention was shown, 4 trisomic (Ts), 4 control, and 3 Ts+NAP+SAL adult offspring brains (from 3 litters) were collected. Calibrator-normalized real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers for N-methyl-D-aspartic acid subunits NR2A and NR2B, and for GABA subunits GABAAα5 and GABAAβ3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistics included analysis of variance and Fisher PLSD with P < .05 as significant. Results: NR2A, NR2B, and GABAAβ3 levels were decreased in Ts vs control (all P < .05). Prenatal NAP+SAL increased NR2A, NR2B, and GABAAβ3 to levels similar to control (all P < .05). A significant difference in GABAAα5 levels was not found. Conclusion: Prenatal NAP+SAL increases NR2A, NR2B, and GABAAβ3 expression in adult DS mice to levels similar to controls. This may explain how NAP+SAL improve developmental milestone achievement. © 2009 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Infant sleep is a major source of concern for many parents. The aims of this longitudinal study were to assess: (a) the development of sleep patterns among infants, (b) the development of maternal cognitions regarding infant sleep, and (c) the relations between these domains during the 1st year of life. Eighty-five mothers were recruited during pregnancy and completed a questionnaire aimed at assessing maternal sleep-related cognitions. After delivery (at 1, 6, and 12 months) sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep logs, and maternal cognitions were reassessed. The findings demonstrated significant predictive and concomitant links between maternal cognitions and infant sleep. Maternal soothing behaviors mediated the relations between these domains. © 2009, Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

N2  - Sleep disturbance during pregnancy can result in excessive daytime sleepiness, diminished daytime performance, inability to concentrate, irritability, and the potential for an increased length of labor and increased risk of operative birth. Sleep disturbance may be the result of a sleep disorder, such as leg cramps, a common yet benign disorder, or restless legs syndrome, a sensorimotor disorder. Both disrupt sleep, are distressing to the pregnant woman, and mimic one another and other serious disorders. During pregnancy, up to 30% of women can be affected by leg cramps, and up to 26% can be affected by restless legs syndrome. © 2009 American College of Nurse-Midwives.

N2  - Introduction. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic neurological disorder that has a negtive influence on sleep. We describe clinical spectrum, polysomnogram and impact on sleep of patients' series with RLS. Methods. We studied 49 patients with RLS. We analyse sociodemographic information, clinical features, therapy and impact on sleep. We realized differents questionnaire: Index of Severity of Sleep, Epworth Scale, Index-RLS, Questionnaire Quality of Life-RLS and Questionnaire from limitation of laboral productivity. Results. Mean age is 60.33±14.27 with similar distribution enter gender. They presented a positive family history in 36,73% with predominant in early onset of symptoms. Secondary causes more frequent associated were rheumatoid arthritis, iron-deficiency, uremia, pregnancy and polineuropathy. Significative prevalence of insomnia (73,43%) and periodic limb movement disorder (51,02%), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (22,45%) and hipersomnia (22,45 %). Pharmacological treatment more used were dopaminergic drugs. We didn't find significant stadistic differences enter clinical feature and therapy, so tendency to better quality of life with dopaminergic drugs. Conclusions. It's an neurological disorder with important delay in diagnosis. Early detection is needed because important impact on sleep efficiency and quality of life, and improvement with therapy, solely dopaminergic drugs.

N2  - Sleep duration is associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk factors, depression, automobile and workplace accidents, and prospective mortality. Little is known, however, about sleep patterns in the US population. The 2004-2007 National Health Interview Survey-Sample Adult Files provide nationally representative data for 110,441 noninstitutionalized US adults aged 18 years or older, and multinomial logistic regression examines whether variables in 5 domains - demographic, family structure, socioeconomic, health behavior, and health status - are associated with long or short sleep duration. Being older, non-Hispanic black, or a current or former smoker; having low levels of education, income, or few income sources; consuming few or numerous drinks in a week; or reporting cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, underweight, or activity limitations is associated with increased odds of both long and short sleep duration. Other variables are associated with shorter (e.g., living with young children, being unmarried, working long hours, more frequent binge drinking) or longer (e.g., being younger, Mexican American, pregnant, or having low levels of physical activity) sleep hours. The authors identify numerous risk factors for long and short sleep; many of those variables are potential confounders of the relation between sleep hours and other health outcomes.

N2  - The mechanisms linking intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) with adulthood obesi t y and diabetes are unknown. These s tudies inves t igated energy metabol ism in 8 wk and 5 month old male and female mice subjected to protein malnutrition in utero. We investigated the metabolic phenotype of IUGR offspring prior to the onset of obesity. We also investigated weather B6 mice subjected to prenatal protein defciency also develop signs of Type II Diabetes. Undernourished pups from pregnant C57BL/6J dams fed a protein defcient diet (6 % protein, UO) were cross-fostered to lactating dams fed normal breeder chow. UO exhibited lower birth weight (∼60% of normal weight), but displayed rapid catch-up growth. 8 wk old chow-fed UO mice exhibit improved glucose clearance relative to CO. However, UO exhibited marked abnormalities in circadian rhythms of wheel running, feeding behavior and metabolic activity. Specifcally, food intake, energy expenditure and the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were increased in UO during the lights-on period. Expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism revealed that expression of Rev-erba in liver was dramatically reduced in UO at 2 mo of age. Rev-erba repressed genes involved in circadian regulation (Bmal1, Per2) and infammation (plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1) were increased in UO mice. The same profle of gene expression was observed in male UO at 5 mo of age. UO mice exhibit a metabolic disorder involving abnormal circadian patterns of feeding behavior, increased lipogenesis and infammation prior to obesity. Loss of Rev-erba expression and function may be a key factor in metabolic dysregulation associated with IUGR.

N2  - Abstract The composition of the biological clock metering the duration of human gestation remains a central question in reproductive biology. Our goal is to understand the molecular timing machinery comprising this biological clock to prevent or better treat human preterm labor, We have generated and analyzed mice with defects in prostaglandin biosynthesis, prostaglandin catabolism, and oxytocin production in efforts to begin to define the key physiological pathways. These, and other, genetic studies in mice reveal an essential function for cyclooxygenase-1- generated prostaglandin F2 alpha for labor onset and the degrading enzyme hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase in the maintenance of pregnancy. While these studies have elucidated the pathway for parturition timing in rodents, the findings have resulted in limited understanding for mechanisms of human parturition. Our recent efforts analyze the contribution of genetic determinants to preterm birth in humans. Evidence for important genetic contributors to human preterm birth will be summarized from family and population-based studies. We have begun to analyze DNA from families with recurrent preterm birth and control families without preterm infants through genome-wide association and candidate gene studies, Our ongoing efforts to identify novel contributors to human preterm birth by genetic epidemiological and comparative genomic methods will be described.

N2  - Results: An adverse intrauterine environment is associated with long-term metabolic consequences in progeny such as obesity and insulin resistance. We investigated metabolic and genetic adaptations in male C57BL/6J mice, whose parents were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or normal chow (NC) for 4 weeks prior to breeding and throughout pregnancy and lactation until weaning. At weaning, offspring of HFD parents (PHF) or NC parents (PNC) were fed either normal chow (PNC and PHF) or a HFD (PNC-HF and PHF-HF) for 9 weeks. At 12 weeks, body weight, fat mass and concentrations of insulin, adiponectin and leptin were unchanged in PHF mice. Indeed, PHF mice had improved glucose tolerance, increased Akt phosphorylation in the liver, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue and increased soleus muscle mitochondrial oxygen consumption compared to PNC. In PHF versus PNC, microarray analyses revealed a coordinate induction of genes that regulate ubiquinone biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid elongation, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in the liver; increased expression of circadian rhythm and TGF-β signaling in skeletal muscle and increased expression of ubiquinone biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and ERK/MAPK signaling in white adipocytes. Unexpectedly, PHF-HF mice developed impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, obesity and hypoadiponectinemia relative to PNC-HF. Thus offspring of HFD parents exhibit increased insulin sensitivity, improved glucose tolerance and a transcriptional profile consistent with increased metabolic capacity when fed a low fat diet. These changes are maladaptive when calories are in excess, because parental HFD programs offspring to develop the metabolic syndrome when fed a high fat diet.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder, characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs and usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations. It begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, is partially or totally relieved by movement and is exacerbated or occurs mainly in the evening or night. People suffering from RLS are estimated to represent 2-3% of the general Japanese population, which is relatively lower than the estimated prevalence in western countries. Supportive diagnostic critevia include family history, the presence of periodic-leg movements (PLM) when awake or asleep, and a positive response to dopaminergic treatment. RLS phenotypes include an early onset form that is usually idiopathic with frequent familial history and a late onset form that is usually secondary to other somatic conditions that are causative factors in RLS occurrence. In all patients presenting with complaints of insomnia or discomfort in the lower limbs, diagnosis of RLS should be considered. RLS should be differentiated from akathisia, which is an urge to move the whole body in the absence of uncomfortable sensations. Polysomnographic studies and the suggested immobilization test (SIT) can detect PLM in patients that are asleep or awake. RLS may cause severe sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, depressive and anxious symptoms, and may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Secondary RLS may occur due to iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, peripheral neuropathy and drug use including antipsychotics and antidepressants. Small fiber neuropathy can trigger RLS or mimic its symptoms. RLS is associated with many neurological disorders, including Parkinson disease and multiple system atrophy; althoughit does not predispose to these diseases. A symptom rating scale for RLS authorized by the International RLS Study Group (IRLS) would facilitate accurate diagnosis of this condition.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common movement disorder wherein sensory motor symptoms are observed in the limbs mainly during sleep and quiet wakefulness. The diagnostic criteria for RLS were established in 1995 by the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) and revised in 2003. The prevalence of RLS in Europe and North America was reported to be between 5% and 12%. On the other hand, the prevalence of RLS in Asia was lesser than that in Europe and North America: it was estimated to be less than 4%. This difference might be associated with vacial, cultural, and language differences. Genetic factors are known to contribute to the etiology of RLS in up to two-thirds of these patients. Furthermore, RLS might complicate an already existing medical condition. The development of secondary RLS is associated with renal failure, iron deficiency, frequent blood donation, Parkinson disease, neuropathy, as well as pregnancy. Generally, these medical condition are more frequently complicated in patient with RLS than in healthy controls. However, there is no conclusive evidence to prove an association between these medical conditions and RLS. Genetic contribution, environmental factors and other covariates such as gender, age, iron deficiency, as well as medical conditions play an important role in the development of RLS. In conclusion, epidemiological evidence suggests that both the primary and secondary forms of RLS are common neurological disorders. Future epidemiological studies are required to determine the potential risk factors contributing to the development of this disorder.

N2  - Results: The mechanisms linking intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) with adulthood obesity and diabetes are unknown. These studies investigated energy metabolism in 8 wk and 5 month old male and female mice subjected to protein malnutrition in utero. We investigated the metabolic phenotype of IUGR offspring prior to the onset of obesity. We also investigated weather B6 mice subjected to prenatal protein deficiency also develop signs of Type II Diabetes. Undernourished pups from pregnant C57BL/6J dams fed a protein deficient diet (6 % protein, UO) were cross-fostered to lactating dams fed normal breeder chow. UO exhibited lower birth weight (60% of normal weight), but displayed rapid catch-up growth. 8 wk old chow-fed UO mice exhibit improved glucose clearance relative to CO. However, UO exhibited marked abnormalities in circadian rhythms of wheel running, feeding behavior and metabolic activity. Specifically, food intake, energy expenditure and the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were increased in UO during the lights-on period. Expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism revealed that expression of Rev-erbα in liver was dramatically reduced in UO at 2 mo of age. Rev-erbα repressed genes involved in circadian regulation (Bmall, Per2) and inflammation (plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1) were increased in UO mice. The same profile of gene expression was observed in male UO at 5 mo of age. UO mice exhibit a metabolic disorder involving abnormal circadian patterns of feeding behavior, increased lipogenesis and inflammation prior to obesity. Loss of Rev-erbα expression and function may be a key factor in metabolic dysregulation associated with IUGR.

N2  - The information about aspergillosis locations in the reproductive organ is scarce. This short paper deals with aspergillosis in the dog genital tract with hyphae present in semen. There are two therapy schemes used in visceral mycoses, non-invasive treatment and surgical intervention. Considering the future reproductive career of the dog, we decided on antifungal drugs administration. Based on the microbiological results, we administered amoxycillin with clavulonate (Synulox® 500 mg, twice daily) orally. Itraconazole was used as an antimycological agent (Orungal®, 100 mg, twice daily) every other week. In 8th week of therapy no Aspergillus spp. growth was noted, yet slight Penicillium growth was observed. After 12 weeks of treatment, no fungus growth was present. Neither spores or hyphae were seen in the microscopic examination. Three months after the termination of the therapy, the dog mated with two females. In one case, unifetal pregnancy was diagnosed by ultrasound examination on day 42 after mating. Due to purulent discharge on day 45 after mating, the owner decided to terminate the pregnancy. In the other case, severe pyometra appeared 12 days after the second mating and the owner decided to put the female to sleep. The pathogen eradication from the ejaculates may be treated as a serious success, yet the lack of litters after mating calls for an explanation and consequences of Aspergillus spp. infection need to be considered. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Obesity among children and adolescents is a growing public health problem. The aim of the present paper is to identify potential determinants of obesity and risk groups among 3- to 17-year old children and adolescents to provide a basis for effective prevention strategies. METHODS: Data were collected in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), a nationally representative and comprehensive data set on health behaviour and health status of German children and adolescents. Body height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was classified according to IOTF cut-off points. Statistical analyses were conducted on 13,450 non-underweight children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years. The association between overweight, obesity and several potential determinants was analysed for this group as well as for three socio-economic status (SES) groups. A multiple logistic regression model with obesity as the dependent variable was also calculated. RESULTS: The strongest association with obesity was observed for parental overweight and for low SES. Furthermore, a positive association with both overweight (including obesity) and obesity was seen for maternal smoking during pregnancy, high weight gain during pregnancy (only for mothers of normal weight), high birth weight, and high media consumption. In addition, high intakes of meat and sausages, total beverages, water and tea, total food and beverages, as well as energy-providing food and beverages were significantly associated with overweight as well as with obesity. Long sleep time was negatively associated with obesity among 3- to 10-year olds. Determinants of obesity occurred more often among children and adolescents with low SES. CONCLUSION: Parental overweight and a low SES are major potential determinants of obesity. Families with these characteristics should be focused on in obesity prevention.

N2  - Background: The present study explores the impact of mothers' PTSD during pregnancy and postpartum on their young infants' sleep regulation at 4-6 months of age, and on a subset the associations between infant sleep dysregulation and subsequent development of preschool behavior problems. Methods: Participants were childhood trauma survivors with (PTSD+; n=58) or without (Trauma/PTSD-; n=67) PTSD initiating prenatal care for their first child. Trauma exposure, PTSD and MDD symptoms, and socioeconomic status (SES) were collected, as was maternal-report infant sleep questionnaire in postpartum yielding total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and 2 factors, Sleep Alone (sleep anxiety) and Sleep Readiness (sleep stability). Mothers also rated infant temperament and toddler behavior problems. Results: Infants of mothers with prenatal PTSD had lower TST compared to infants of Trauma/PTSD- mothers (M=797(sd=19) vs 740(sd=21) minutes; p < 05). Maternal pre-or postnatal PTSD symptoms were unrelated to the two sleep factors, Sleep Alone and Sleep Readiness. By contrast, infant of postpartum depressed mothers had higher Sleep Alone scores compared to infants of non-depressed mothers (M=0.22(sd=.17) vs M=0.17 (sd=.13), p=.05) suggesting that infants of depressed mothers had more sleep anxiety. Problematic infant temperament was associated with sleep anxiety (r=.26∗) and WASO (r=.25, both p < 05), and infancy WASO was associated with toddlerhood externalizing behavior problems (r=.40, p < 05). Conclusions: These findings add to a growing literature showing that maternal prenatal and postpartum stress, anxiety, and depression may have lasting effects on child development, and that this effect may be mediated via early onset sleep dysregulation.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances are known to impact physical and psychological wellbeing. Limited available data from women with a moderate-to-high socioeconomic background suggest that poor sleep in late pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for cesarean section. Such an association has important clinical implications. However, the impact of sleep disruption on mode of delivery has not been investigated in a heterogeneous sample of pregnant women attending a large academic medical center. Methods: Pregnant women ≥18 years, carrying a single fetus, were recruited from the labor and delivery unit and invited to complete several sleep questionnaires including the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS). Total score ranges from 0-147 and a mean score ≥3 is considered a threshold for poor sleep. Women with snoring ≥3 nights/week were considered to have habitual snoring. Non-pregnant women of child bearing age (18-45 years) were recruited as controls. Medical records were accessed to obtain delivery information. Results: In total, 141 pregnant women and 83 controls have been studied. Mean ages were 29.8±5.7 years vs. 32.7±8.0 years respectively. There were no differences in pre-pregnancy BMI between groups (26.5±7.2 vs. 26.7±7.1kg/m2). Total GSDS score was higher for pregnant women than controls (61.6±17.6 vs. 47.8±15.7; p<0.001). In addition, pregnant women were more likely than controls to have a mean GSDS score ≥3 (55% vs.19%; p<0.001) and report habitual snoring (34% vs. 17%; p=0.006). Overall, 38% of pregnancies resulted in a cesarean section. In a logistic regression with mode of delivery as the dependent variable, and controlling for previous cesarean section, parity, maternal age, BMI, gestational age, and birth weight, no sleep-related parameters were found to be significant predictors of mode of delivery. Conclusion: Contrary to previous findings, our data do not support the hypotheses that sleep disruption in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for cesarean section.

N2  - Different factors have been proposed to influence morningness-eveningness, biological rhythms, and sleep-wake cycles, but few studies focused on the influence of social habits. Here, we focus on the influence of children and partners on the social habits of women at different stages of their lives and on synchronization within the family. One hundred and seventy-nine women participated in the study and were allocated into four groups: women without children, pregnant women without children, pregnant women with children, and non-pregnant mothers. Morningness was predicted by the presence of children, and earlier chronotype was predicted by the presence of children, pregnancy, and age. Average sleep duration was longest in pregnant women. The presence of children was responsible for a difference in rise times of approximately 1.5h on the weekend. Subjective sleep-onset latencies were shortest in women with children. The synchrony between partners (husband/wife) was 0.46 in women without children, 0.79 in pregnant women, 0.40 in women with children, and 0.56 between mother and child. Partners' chronotypes were highly correlated, as were those of mother and child. This study suggests children have a strong influence on their mother's lifestyle and sleep-wake rhythm, far beyond the first months of life, and that children are a more important social factor than the male partner.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnant women's sleep disturbance due to fetal movement is well known. Fetal movement is thought to be an index of fetal well-being. However, as there has never been a way to easily and reliably record fetal movement, psychophysiological studies of pregnant women's sleep disturbance and fetal well-being have not been done. In 2008, we introduced a long-term monitoring system for fetal movement during maternal sleep at home using a newly developed sensor (Early Human Dev 84:595-603). We confirmed that the new sensor was more sensitive than maternal subjective evaluation but less sensitive than ultrasound imaging. For this study, we developed a fetal movement recorder that pregnant women can operate by themselves. We also developed a system of analysis based on the proposal made in 2008. Methods: We developed a small capacitive acceleration sensor with high output power (700mV/0.1G). The recorder (290g, 77mm×27mm×140mm) consists of two sensors (one for fetal movement; one for maternal movement), biological amplifier, and SD card drive. The analysis can display both fetal and maternal movements, automatically detect fetal movement, change a threshold of fetal movement, count detected movement based on time, automatically and manually exclude artifacts coming from mothers, and make a comparison based on gestation weeks. The subjects were four normal pregnant women (26-38 yr) who gave written informed consent. They recorded fetal movement from 24 to 36 gestation weeks every four weeks. They put the fetal sensor on their abdomens and the maternal sensor on their thighs, and recorded fetal movement using the recorder during nocturnal sleep. Results: Medians counts for fetal movement detected per hour during maternal sleep were 153 at 24 weeks, 166 at 28 weeks, 227 at 32 weeks, and 142 at 36 weeks. Fetal movement per hour was the highest at 32 weeks. This result was similar to our previous result of maternal subjective evaluation in 2008. Conclusion: The pregnant women were able to easily record fetal movement using the new recorder at night by themselves. We have been collecting data of subjects with a normal pregnant course whether the system of analysis for fetal movement is successful.

N2  - Introduction: Epidemiological studies suggest that racial background may be a risk factor for sleep disturbances. African Americans have higher risk for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) than Caucasians and may be at higher risk for insomnia. Data suggest that sleep disorders in pregnancy may impact maternal and fetal health. No study has addressed racial differences in sleep during pregnancy. Methods: A multi-ethnic sample of adult women attending a large academic obstetric clinic were recruited during their last trimester and invited to complete several sleep questionnaires. These included the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS, Lee 1992), the Berlin Questionnaire, and a 4-item scale about restless legs (RLS) symptoms. A mean score >3 on the GSDS or any of the sub-scale scores (e.g., sleep quality or daytime functioning) is consistent with DSM-IV criteria for insomnia. Results: In total, 575 women have been studied as part of an ongoing investigation. Racial background was 71% Caucasian, 15% African American, 6% Asian, 4% Hispanic, and the remainder of mixed race. Overall, mean age was 30.2±5.8 years and 20% were obese prior to pregnancy, with African Americans having the highest and Asians having the lowest pre-pregnancy BMI (30.1±8.0 vs. 21.6±4.0kg/m2). Asians were least likely to report habitual snoring (17% compared to 40% of African Americans and 33% of Caucasians and Hispanics). After adjusting for pre-pregnancy BMI, race was not a predictor of habitual snoring. Regardless of race, the majority of women reported symptoms consistent with insomnia: poor sleep quality (74% African Americans, 72% Caucasians, 57% Asians, and 81% Hispanics) and poor daytime functioning (72% African Americans, 73% Caucasians, 51% Asians, and 71% Hispanics). Symptoms of RLS were more common in Caucasians than African Americans (37% vs. 24%; p<0.05). Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are commonly reported during pregnancy. Racial differences are apparent in some sleep disorders although pre-pregnancy BMI likely accounts for the differences in habitual snoring. These findings may have relevance to the management of pregnant women.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances (SD) are risk factors for adverse health outcomes. SD is also associated with increased circulating concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines. Excessive inflammation is associated with the adverse pregnancy outcomes. As an initial step in assessing the implications of disturbed sleep in pregnancy, we evaluated the relationship between SD and circulating cytokines in early gestation. Methods: Sleep duration and sleep quality were determined by self- report. The inflammatory cytokines IL-2, -6, -8, IFNα, TNFα and antiinflammatory cytokines IL-4, -5, and -10 were measured by Luminex technology. Data were analyzed using nonparametric correlations. The pro:anti-inflammatory ratio was calculated as the mean multiple of the median (MOM) for each relevant cytokine type to normalize the data for comparison Results: Data were collected as part of a trial of exercise to reduce the frequency of recurrent preeclampsia. (Exercise did not have an effect on sleep in early pregnancy therefore, all women were combined). Participants (N = 85) were at 15 ± 2.8 weeks gestation and were 30 ± 4.9 years. Short sleep duration (< 7h/night) was reported inl 3%. Sleep quality was deemed poor in 35 (41%) women. Total sleep duration was correlated with both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations (p = .32, p = .003; p = .30, p = .006). Sleep quality was not related to cytokine concentrations. The ratio of pro- to anti-inflammatory cytokines was not related to sleep duration or sleep quality. Conclusion: Almost half of women report poor sleep quality in early pregnancy. Nonetheless, sleep quality was not associated with cytokine concentrations. Sleep duration was quite variable and was positively correlated with circulating cytokines. The ratio of these inflammatory markers did not relate to either sleep variable, thus the implications for net inflammatory effect is indeterminate. Longitudinal examination of sleep and cytokine across pregnancy may provide additional insight.

N2  - Introduction: Persistent disturbed sleep after successful treatment of a major depressive disorder (MDD) is a risk factor for future relapse. Within the context of pregnancy sleep disturbance during the 3rd trimester predicts depressed mood during the postpartum period. The present study sought to determine whether the level of disturbed sleep during the 3rd trimester in 65 pregnant women who recently remitted from MDD would predict a reemergence of a core symptom of MDD (reemergence) at 10 weeks postpartum. Methods: The sample consisted of 65 pregnant women who entered a randomized controlled study of acupuncture for the treatment of MDD but no longer met criteria for either of the two core MDD symptoms in the third trimester. Measures included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and the depression section of the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID), administered during the last trimester and at 10 weeks postpartum. Results: The following predictors were entered into a binary logistic regression to predict reemergence of the core symptoms of depression at 10 weeks postpartum: the third trimester HRSD sleep subscale, the HRSD score without the sleep items, randomization group (3 levels), and a dichotomous variable indicating continued treatment in the post- partum. Disturbed sleep was the only significant predictor (%2= 12.01, p< 0.05; Nagelkerke r-square = 0.29.). Exploratory analyses revealed sleep disturbance at the beginning of the night, but not in the middle or at the end of the night, was predictive of reemergence of a core symptom (OR = 3.33 95% CI[1.14 - 9.71]). Conclusion: Pregnant women with persistent sleep difficulties following successful treatment of depression are at greater risk for a reemer- gence of a core symptom of depression during the postpartum period. Implications of this study in the prevention of depressed symptoms in the postpartum period are discussed.

N2  - Introduction: Previous findings have suggested an association between women's poor subjective sleep during and immediately after pregnancy, and postpartum blues (PPB) symptoms. This study further explored the roles of objectively and subjectively measured sleep in PPB as a function of parity. Methods: During the third trimester (Time-1), 24 multiparous (MP) and 20 nulliparous (NP) completed questionnaires on mood and sleep; among them, 23 MP and 18 NP wore actigraphs for 7 days. In the second part of the study, 16MP and 12 NP wore actigraphs during the first postpartum week (Time-2), and 21 MP and 16 NP completed the same mood and sleep questionnaires. Results: For MP mood improved significantly after delivery across all scales, whereas for NP mood significantly worsened on some scales and showed no improvement on others. After delivery, both MP and NP had significantly poorer objective and subjective nighttime sleep and they increased their daytime naps. The deterioration in objective nighttime sleep and the increase in daytime nap numbers were significantly greater in NP than in MP. When regression analyses were applied to MP and NP combined, or to NP alone, poorer subjective but not objective sleep measures were associated with poorer mood at Time-2. However, regression analyses in MP revealed three significant predicting models for postpartum mood: Time-1 objective nighttime sleep, Time-2 subjective nighttime sleep, and sleep-related daytime dysfunction at both times. Conclusion: Subjective perception of poor sleep as a reflection of women's coping and adjustment is a critical factor in postpartum mental health for both MP and NP. Objectively disrupted sleep throughout late pregnancy may predispose healthy MP to postpartum mood disturbances. However, the role of objective sleep disruption among NP is less clear and needs to be examined in a larger sample as non-sleep related factors might be particularly relevant in this sub-group.

N2  - Introduction: Women with preeclampsia have a high prevalence of sleep disordered breathing, and much higher than women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Furthermore, preeclampsia has recently been recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease later in life. The persistence of sleep disordered breathing after delivery is a possible explanation for increased cardiovascular morbidity and warrants evaluation. Methods: Previously, we studied 60 pregnant women (34 with preeclampsia and 26 with healthy uncomplicated pregnancies) with a series of sleep questionnaires and full night polysomnography. Between one and two years post partum, these women were invited to complete follow up sleep surveys and polysomnography. We compared the postpartum survey scores and polysomnography results of women with a preeclampsia history versus the healthy cohort, as well as compared against their own values while pregnant. Results: This study is ongoing and we are reporting interim results here. So far, twenty six women have completed the sleep surveys and all women have reported improved sleep compared to during their pregnancy. Eleven women (seven preeclamptic and four healthy) have so far agreed to return to the sleep lab for polysomnography. From the pregnant state to postpartum, the mean body mass index (BMI) of the preeclamptic women decreased from 39.4 to 33.4 and the mean respi-ratory disturbance index (RDI) improved 13.9 to 3.4. For the healthy cohort, the BMI decreased from 38.3 to 22.6. The mean RDI for the healthy women was below one at both testing times. The mean age of both groups was 32 years. Conclusion: Sleep disordered breathing in women with preeclampsia improves dramatically in the first two years post partum. Although the RDI improved to within the normal range, it remained elevated compared to healthy post partum women of the same age.

N2  - Introduction: Sleeping problem and mood disorder are often related in the general population. Over 50% women during pregnancy have depressive symptom and sleep disturbance. We evaluated subjective and objective sleeping amount and quality in the pregnant women with (WDS) and with no (NDS) depressive symptoms. Methods: We collected the data of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and examined overnight polysomonographic sleep in the women with WDS (depression score of self-rating depression scale was 50 or greater, n=45) and NDS (depression score was fewer than 50, n=45) during the pregnancy of week 16-24. Results: PSQI data revealed that WDS group showed significantly greater score in the factors of problems in sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep continuity and daytime functioning, compared to NDS. Overnight polysomonographic examination revealed that WDS women had reduced total sleep time and sleep efficiency, increased sleep latency and number of wakefulness episode relative to NDS. WDS women also exhibited significantly increased time spent in stage 1, decreased time spent in stages 3 and 4, shortened latency to rapid eye movement and increased time spent in rapid eye movement sleep than those did NDS. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that WDS women have similar characteristics as those seen in the patients with major depression in the general population, including poor sleep quality and decreased amount of sleep with the tool of subjective sleep evaluation. For sleep architecture, WDS women have worsened sleep in non-rapid eye movement sleep and exhibit typical changes in rapid eye movement sleep as those have been reported in major depression in general population.

N2  - Introduction: Measurement of neck circumference is considered a standard part of physical examinations in patients with suspected sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and may be a better correlate of apnea severity than BMI. Recent studies suggest that SDB during pregnancy is associated with hypertension. Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable to SDB due to relatively rapid weight gain and edema. Therefore simple, non-invasive markers of SDB in pregnancy may be clinically useful. Methods: A retrospective record review was undertaken of women admitted to the labor and delivery unit. Data extracted included airway assessments obtained on admission as well as demographics. Measurement of neck circumference by anesthesiologists has been a routine procedure in our institution for over 12 months. Diagnoses of chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and pre-eclampsia were obtained from discharge codes. Results: Data from 1601 records are included. Mean age was 28.8±6.0 years and mean parity was 1.5±1.2. The racial composition was as follows: 70% Caucasian, 14% African American, 11% Asian, 4% Hispanic, and 1% mixed race. Three percent of subjects had a neck circumference ≥40cms which is considered to identify, high risk for SDB in women. African Americans had larger neck circumferences than other races (36.1±3.1cm vs. 35.1±3.0cm in Caucasians vs. 34.2±2.0cm in Asians). A diagnosis of gestational hypertension was present in 8.5% of women and 4.5% received a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. In a logistic regression neck circumference ≥40cm was an independent predictor of gestational hypertension (odds ratio 2.2 95%CI 1.2-3.9; p=0.01), as well as preeclampsia (odds ratio 3.4 95%CI 1.7-6.5; p<0.001) after controlling for covariates such as chronic hypertension, age, BMI, and race. Conclusion: Neck circumference may have clinical utility in helping to identify pregnant women at risk for pre-eclampsia. The known association between neck circumference and SDB raises the possibility that SDB may potentially explain in part this observed association.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between amount of ambient daylight and polysomnographic (PSG) sleep in healthy and depressed pregnant and postpartum women. We hypothesized that a greater amount of ambient daylight would be associated with enhanced PSG sleep quality in healthy and depressed women. Methods: In 25 pregnant women, 15 normal controls (NC; mean age=24.9+4.8 years) and 10 depressed patients (DP; mean age=27.4+5.4 years) and 24 postpartum women, 11 NC (mean age=28.5+6.9 years) and 13 DP (mean age=28.9+6.7 years) who met DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode, sleep was recorded by PSG. Hours of ambient daylight were determined via U.S. Naval Observatory sunrise/sunset tables [http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS-OneYear.php]. Pearson correlations were calculated to examine the relationship between hours of ambient daylight and PSG variables. Results: For combined pregnant NC and DP, hours of ambient daylight was positively associated with stage 2 percent (r=.57, p=.003); and negatively associated with sleep latency ( r=-.48, p=.015); delta minutes (r=-.42, p=.035); delta percent (r=-.46, p=.022); and sleep onset time (r=-.40, p=.045). For combined postpartum NC and DP, hours of ambient light was negatively associated with sleep latency (SL; r=-.47, p=.025) and sleep onset time (r=-.53, p=.010). Conclusion: These findings support the hypothesis that increased day length is associated with improved sleep continuity in pregnant and postpartum women (i.e., earlier sleep onset and shortened sleep latency). Our group has also reported increased day length was associated with improved sleep quality measured by PSG in healthy and depressed menopausal women. The amount of ambient daylight, however, also was associated with a greater percentage of stage 2 sleep and a decreased amount of delta sleep, which was contrary to findings in menopausal women.

N2  - Introduction: Several reports suggest that habitual snoring (HS) during pregnancy (as a marker for sleep-disordered breathing) is associated with gestational hypertension. One potential confounding factor may be the duration of symptoms. New onset HS during pregnancy conceivably could have health ramifications that differ from those of chronic HS, to which cardiovascular and other systems might adapt over a more extended timeframe. However, whether new onset HS during pregnancy is a risk for hypertension is unknown. Methods: Pregnant women were recruited from obstetric clinics during their last trimester of pregnancy and invited to complete several sleep questionnaires. Habitual snoring was defined as snoring ≥3 nights/week and was considered pregnancy-associated if it began during pregnancy. Results: Of 429 women studied (mean age 30.1±5.8 years), 66% reported HS (28% with chronic HS and 38% with pregnancy-associated HS). There was a significant difference in pre-pregnancy BMI between chronic HS, pregnancy-associated HS, and non-HS (29.2±8.5kg/m2 vs. 26.8±7.5kg/m2 vs. 24.0±5.5kg/m2 respectively; p<0.001). In total 22% of women with HS had gestational hypertension compared to 9% of women without HS (p<0.001). The proportion of women with gestation- al hypertension was similar between those with chronic HS and those with pregnancy-associated HS (21% vs. 23% respectively). In a logistic regression model with age, race, gestational age at delivery, smoking status, and pre-pregnancy BMI, HS was independently associated with gestational hypertension (odds ratios 2.0 [95%CI 1.1-3.7] p=0.02). The risk of gestational hypertension was not different between those with chronic HS or pregnancy-associated HS. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that any adverse impact of habitual snoring during pregnancy on maternal blood pressure is similar regardless of whether habitual snoring preceded pregnancy or developed in association with pregnancy. Obstetricians should be aware of the importance of asking about habitual snoring not only initially but also during routine prenatal visits later in pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Obstructive Sleep Apnea is an independent risk factor for CV disease and is associated with an alteration in sympathetic tone. Preeclampsia is a common complication of pregnancy and has been associated with increased sympathetic tone. We evaluated the effect of OSA on sympathetic/parasympathetic balance in preeclampsia and in healthy pregnant females. Methods: We compared Heart Rate Variability (HRV) during 5 minutes of stable stage 2 and REM sleep in healthy pregnant females in third trimester (N=6, 31.3±4.4 yrs, BMI 28.2±5.7 kg/m2), pregnant females with OSA (N=2;34.0±4.2 yrs, BMI 39.0±5.7 kg/m2), preeclamptic women without OSA (N=7; 26.1 ±7.4 yrs., BMI 33.5±6.3 kg/m2) and preeclamptic women with OSA (N=6; 27.8 ± 3.6 yrs, BMI 36.9±4.6 kg/ m2). Temporal and spectral analysis of the R to R intervals and nonlinear properties of HRV was done using HRV Analysis Software version 1.1. For time-domain analysis mean RR was used. For frequency domain VLF, LF, VLF, and LF/HF ratio of the nonparametric spectrum were used. For the nonlinear method SD1 and SD2 were used. Age, BMI, mean RR, VLF, LF, HF, LF/HF ratio, SD1, and SD2 were determined for each group and statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA (for time domain variables) and nonparametric ANOVA (for frequency domain variables) with GraphPad InStat program version 3.01. P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant; all values are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Results: There were significant differences in LF% power (61.93± 13.35 vs. 35.21±13.35; p = 0.02) and LF/HF ratio (8.681±7.285 vs. 1.203±0.629, p=0.016) between patients with and without OSA in the preeclamptic group. There were no differences in HF,LF, LF/HF between the control group and patients with preeclampsia. The results suggest that presence of OSA adversely affects the sympathovagal balance in patients with preeclampsia. Conclusion: Preeclamptic patients with OSA have increased LF power and LF/HF ratio suggesting an abnormal sympathovagal balance during sleep.

N2  - Introduction: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of sleep disturbances among healthy nulliparous women and to quantify changes in sleep during pregnancy. Methods: Prospective, cohort study of healthy nulliparous women recruited between 6-20 weeks gestation who completed a sleep survey at the time of enrollment and in the third trimester. The survey was comprised of the following validated sleep questionnaires: Berlin Questionnaire for sleep apnea syndrome, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), NIH/International Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Question Set, and the Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale (WHI-IRS). Survey results from the initial and third trimester survey were compared using the paired t-test and McNe- mar's test as appropriate. Results: One hundred and eighty-eight women completed both sleep surveys. The mean gestational age was 13.9 ± 3.8 weeks and 30.0 ± 2.2 at the first and second survey respectively. The frequency of poor sleep (PSQI > 5) increased significantly during pregnancy (39.2% vs. 53.2%, p = 0.001). Insomnia (WHI-IRS ≥ 9) was more prevalent in the third trimester (37.3% vs. 54.1%, p < 0.001). Compared to the initial assessment, mean sleep duration was significantly shorter in the third trimester (7.4 ± 1.2 vs. 7.0 ± 1.3, p < 0.001), and the percentage of patients who slept less than 7 hours per night increased (26.4% vs. 39.6% p = 0.001). The percentage of patients who met diagnostic criteria for RLS increased from 17.6% at recruitment to 30.9% in the third trimester (p = 0.001). The proportion of patients who screened positive for sleep apnea on the Berlin Questionnaire also increased from 10.6% to 19.7% (p =0.002). Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are prevalent among healthy nulliparous women, and increase significantly during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Pre-eclampsia is a feared complication of pregnancy. Previous retrospective studies have indicated that women who snore are especially at risk. In this prospective study development of snoring and obstructive breathing was correlated to blood pressure and development of preeclampsia. Methods: 503 consecutive pregnant women answered questionnaires concerning snoring, fatigue, daytime sleepiness and edema. Epworth Sleepiness score (ESS) and symptoms of restless legs syndrome (RLS) were also included. The questionnaire was presented in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester. Blood pressure was also recorded. Data concerning pregnancy and delivery complications were taken from the maternity clinic's records. Women snoring often-always at visit 2 and/or 3 were denoted habitual snorers. They were offered a sleep respiratory recording; 34 volunteered. Results: 36/503 women (7, 2%) snored habitually already at the first visit, and 19,5% at the end of pregnancy. There was no difference concerning weight increase during pregnancy between habitual snorers and non-snorers. Habitual snorers reported more edema at visit 2 and 3, and significantly higher scores in morning and daytime tiredness and ESS score compared to non-snorers. 22% of the habitually snoring women reported RLS-symptoms already in the 1st trimester, 33% in the 2nd and 32% in the 3rd. For non-snorers the corresponding figures were 14%, 25 % and 29%. Systolic blood pressure increased significantly more in habitual snorers already between 1st and 2nd visit. Weight and Apgar scores of the newborns showed no difference. Pre-eclampsia developed in 18 women, twice as common among habitual snorers (6/93 = 6,5%) as in non-snorers (10/354 = 2,8%). They had higher snoring scores at all visits, with the greatest difference in the third trimester (p=0,058), and their diastolic pressure increased significantly more already at the 2nd visit compared to women without pre-eclampsia. They had more edema (p<0,001, 3rd visit) and higher increase in BMI (p<0,001). There was no relationship to RLS. 9/34 sleep recordings showed supine AHI >5. Two women who later developed pre-eclampsia were recorded; both had AHI >10. Conclusion: Habitual snorers had more daytime tiredness and higher ESS scores and their systolic blood pressure increased more already during early pregnancy. The incidence of RLS was higher. Pre-eclampsia was twice as common among snorers as non-snorers, but the difference was not significant due to the low number of cases.

N2  - Introduction: We examined whether small body size at birth and prenatal tobacco or alcohol exposure predict poorer sleep and more sleep disturbances in children.Methods: An epidemiological cohort study of 289 eight-year-old children born at term gestation. Sleep characteristics (sleep duration, latency, efficiency) were measured by actigraphs for seven consecutive nights (M = 7.1, SD = 1.2). We used both continuous measures of poor sleep and binary variables of short sleep, low sleep efficiency (< 10th percentiles) and long sleep latency (> 90th percentile). Parents filled in the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC). Results: Lower birth weight and shorter length at birth were associated with longer sleep latency, and lower sleep efficiency. The odds to being in the long sleep latency or low sleep efficiency category increased by 1.7- (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.1 to 2.7) and 2.0-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 3.2) for every 1-standard deviation decrease in birth weight and length at birth, respectively. For every 1-standard deviation decrease in ponderal index at birth the risk of parent-reported sleep disorders increased by 1.4 fold (95% CI 1.0 to 2.0). The odds to being in the short sleep or low sleep efficiency category increased by 2.9- (95% CI 1.1 to 7.6) and 3.6-fold (95% CI, 1.3 to 10.0) among children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Conclusion: Poorer sleep in children may have prenatal origins. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy may pose a risk for poorer sleep.

N2  - Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with significant maternal and infant morbidity are on the rise in Western society despite advances of medical technology. Current risk factors are insufficient to identify women at greatest risk of developing an adverse outcome. An attempt to identify novel contributors to increased risk is warranted. Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, yet are often dismissed as irrelevant. Emerging evidence indicates that sleep disturbances are associated with poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease. Disturbed sleep is also linked with an increased inflammatory response. Increased inflammation is proposed as a key biological pathway through which chronic disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes develop. In this paper, we propose a model and a testable hypothesis of how disturbed sleep in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy could contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth via increased inflammation.

N2  - Introduction: Three retrospective studies suggested a high frequency (11-26%) of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy. None of these studies used standardized methods for assessment of RLS and sleep. Characteristics and determinants of RLS during pregnancy are poorly known. Methods: Women during (from the 2nd trimester, 1x/month) and after pregnancy (8 weeks post-partum) are prospectively studied. Assessment includes 1) interview about RLS-symptoms and sleep habits/disturbances: 2) standardized questionnaires (incl. the international RLS-scale (IRLSS), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI)); 3) blood tests (incl. hemoglobin, C- reactive protein and ferritin), 4) leg actigraphy (3rd trimester and post-partum). Results: So far 233 women were included. RLS was diagnosed in 22 women (9.5%). 28% of them had a positive family history for RLS, 60% reported onset of RLS-symptoms before the 20th week, 60% had RLS-symptoms daily, 60% had an IRLSS>20, and 85% had a PSQI> 5. Anemia (defined as Hb <11 g/dl in pregnant women) was found in 10% of affected and unaffected women. Ferritin levels <50 were found in 88% of women. Women with (pRLS) and without RLS (nRLS) had similar values in hemoglobin CRP, and ferritin (mean Hb 11.8 mg/dl in pRLS, 12mg/dl in nRLS; Ferritin 19.1 ug/l in pRLS, 13.3 in nRLS). Conclusion: Preliminary results of this ongoing study suggest that RLS in pregnancy: 1) is present in 10% ofwomen; 2) frequently appears early in pregnancy; 3) is often severe/ frequent; 4) may not be related (only) to anemia/low ferritin levels; 5) has a significant impact on sleep quality.

N2  - Introduction: A third of women who experienced childhood abuse develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as adults. Both a history of trauma and PTSD are associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) dysregulation, depression and poor health, which in turn may affect maternal care. Animal studies demonstrate that prenatal stress impacts the offspring's cognitive and emotional function. Additionally, studies report that prenatal stress alters offspring's sleep. As sleep difficulties are a core symptom for several Axis I disorders and behavioral problems in children, they may be a mediating factor for inter-generational transfer of trauma-related symptoms. This study assessed the relationship between antenatal trauma-related symptoms and sleep difficulties in infants. Methods: Women (age 27.2±5.7) with a history of childhood trauma with PTSD (n=59) or without (n=71), were recruited when initiating prenatal care for their first child. Infant sleep was assessed with a questionnaire administered at four and six months postpartum. Prenatal maternal measures included trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, substance use, and cortisol. Postnatal maternal measures included depression and PTSD symptoms. Results: Overall, infant sleep improved between four and six months. Postnatal PTSD but not depressive symptoms were associated with more wake after sleep onset (WASO) and less total sleep time (TST). WASO was also associated with severity of childhood trauma and diurnal cortisol change during gestation, while TST only with the former. The highest WASO and lowest TST were observed in infants of mothers with PTSD symptoms both during pregnancy and postpartum. Factor analysis of the sleep questionnaire suggested that WASO was associated with separation anxiety at bedtime, and difficulty initiating sleep, while TST was associated with the latter. Conclusion: Pre and postnatal maternal PTSD symptom severity work additively to exacerbate sleep difficulties in infants. Potentially, in addition to the deleterious effects of prenatal stress, PTSD impacts mother-infant interactions around bedtime that are associated with sleep initiation.

N2  - Introduction: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between self reported snoring and adverse pregnancy outcomes in healthy nulliparous women. Methods: This is a prospective, cohort study of healthy nulliparous women recruited between 6-20 weeks gestation who completed a sleep survey at the time of enrollment and in the third trimester. Frequent snoring was defined as snoring > 3 nights/week. Subjects were followed prospectively and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted from the medical record by study personnel blinded to the sleep survey results. Uni-variable comparisons were made evaluating the relationship of frequent snoring to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Factors that in univariable analysis were associated with snoring at a level of p < 0.10 were placed in a multivariable logistic regression to ascertain independent associations. Results: Two hundred and one women were recruited of which 188 completed both surveys. The mean gestational age was 13.9 ± 3.8 weeks and 30.0 ± 2.2 at the first and second survey respectively. Eleven percent of women (21/188) reported frequent snoring in early pregnancy, 16.5% (31/188) reported frequent snoring in the third trimester, and 9% (17/188) reported frequent snoring in both early and late pregnancy. Women who reported any frequent snoring in pregnancy (early and/or third trimester) were more likely to develop gestational diabetes (14.3% vs. 3.3%; OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.3, 18.1). For women who reported frequent snoring in both early and late pregnancy the odds ratio for developing gestational diabetes was 8.5 (95% CI 2.1, 33.8). Even after controlling for BMI, frequent snoring continued to be significantly associated with gestational diabetes: adjusted OR 4.9 (95% CI 1.3, 19.3) for women with any frequent snoring, adjusted OR 6.5 (95% CI 1.6, 27.3) for those with frequent snoring both in early and late pregnancy. Conclusion: Frequent snoring during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes.

N2  - Introduction: We previously reported that perinatal alcohol exposure (AE) alters molecular components of GABAergic signaling in hypotha- lamic regions important for the regulation of sleep in juvenile rats (Vol- gin DV, Neurosci. Lett. 439:182-186, 2008). Using the same rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), we investigated whether perinatal AE leads to changes in sleep-wake behavior in adult rats. Methods: Alcohol (5.25 g/kg/day) was administered to male rats via intragastric intubations during postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period equivalent to human brain development during the third trimester of pregnancy (AE group; N=4). Control pups were sham-intubated (S group; N=3). On PD 52-78, rats were instrumented for EEG and nuchal EMG recording. Following recovery and habituation, sleep-wake behavior was recorded on PD 70-97 during one 24 h-long session that started at 9-10 AM. Wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) were distinguished in 10 s epochs covering six h of recording during the lights- on (12PM-6PM) and six h during lights-off (12AM-6AM) period. Results: During the lights-off phase, REMS percentage was significantly lower in AE than S rats (4.3%±1.2 (SE) vs. 9.7%±0.6 in S group; p=0.02), whereas the percentages of SWS were not significantly different (24.6%±4.7 vs. 29.1%±3.6 in S group). During the lights-on period, sleep did not differ between the groups (total sleep in AE rats: 63.1%±3.0 vs. 59.4%±1.3 in S rats), but AE group tended to have higher SWS latency, and had significantly higher REMS latency (147±17 vs. 60±21 min in S rats; p=0.02). Conclusion: Perinatal AE leads to changes in sleep-wake behavior in a rat model of FASD that extend into the adulthood and are suggestive of problems with sleep initiation during the rest period and REMS generation and/or maintenance during the active period.

N2  - Introduction: Obesity during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal complications. Emerging data suggest that habitual snoring, a cardinal symptom of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), during pregnancy is also associated with adverse outcomes. The goal of this study is to determine the relationship between habitual snoring, obesity, and gestational hypertension. Methods: Women with singleton pregnancies were invited in their last trimester to answer several sleep-related questionnaires. Risk for SDB was defined as the presence of habitual snoring (≥3-4 nights/week). Prepregnancy BMI was used to classify subjects as underweight (BMI<20); normal weight (BMI 20-24.9); overweight (BMI 25-29.9) and obese (BMI >30). Subjects were further grouped according to whether their absolute weight gain exceeded Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations, which are 28-40lbs for underweight women, 25-35lbs for normal weight women, 15-25lbs for overweight women, and ≤15lbs for obese women. Medical records were reviewed after delivery to obtain information on gestational hypertension. Results: Of 363 subjects, 90 (25%) were obese. Weight gain in excess of IOM recommendations was an independent predictor of SDB risk (OR: 1.9 [1.2-3.1]) after adjusting for pre-pregnancy BMI, maternal age, and race. Compared to non-obese women, obese women were more likely to be at risk for SDB (61% vs. 27%, p<0.002) and gestational hypertension (30% vs. 14%, p<0.001). In a logistic regression, after adjusting for confounders including pre-pregnancy BMI and excess pounds gained, SDB risk remained an independent predictor of gestational hypertension(OR:2.0[95% CI 1.11-3.6]). A significant interaction was observed between obesity and SDB risk for gestational hypertension (OR:4.1 [2.1-7.8]; p<0.001). Conclusion: Weight gain greater than IOM recommendations during pregnancy independently increases risk for SDB, as reflected by habitual snoring. These data suggest that SDB may help explain why obesity and excess weight gain promote gestational hypertension.

N2  - Introduction: The prevalence of OSA is increased during pregnancy, with potential adverse consequences. OSA in pregnancy leads to decelerations in the rhythm of fetal heart and may lead to growth retardation. However, little is known about how oligodendrocytes in fetal central nervous system (CNS) respond to maternal occurrence of intermittent hypoxia (IH) during sleep, and what the long-term consequences may be in the offspring. Methods: Timed pregnant mice (9.5 day-post-coitus) were exposed to either 3 days of IH (8% O2/21% O2/3 min cycle/12hrs during the light phase), or normoxia. After maternal exposures, animals were transferred to room air until sacrifice. Oligodendrocyte-specific proteins, myelin-related proteins and neurocytoskeletal components were assessed at different post-exposure days by means of immunostaining, quantitative real-time PCR, and Western blots. Results: Olig2 expression analysis revealed a significant decline in the number of Olig2+ OPCs in e12.5 IH-exposed neural tubes. At later e14.5 in IH-exposed spinal cords, Olig2+ progenitors were distributed less evenly in both gray and white matter regions, with more Olig2+ cells in the ventricular zone, suggesting an increased proliferation of neural progenitor cells. Transcriptional levels of mbp and MAG in P6 neonatal brains and spinal cords were significantly inhibited, and were accompanied by remarkable decreases of myelinated fibers labeled with anti-MAG in the regions of corpus callosum and external capsule at P10. However, myelinated axons were restored at P30 despite thinner white matter that was associated with decreased expression of neuromicrotubule and neurofilaments. Conclusion: These findings suggest that oligodendroglial-axonal development is vulnerable to IH insults, as occurs in OSA, and that acute maternal IH during the critical window of fetal CNS development can induce impairments in neonatal white matter including myelin and axons.

N2  - Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been implicated as a cause of low birthweight. We sought to determine the impact of OSA on neonatal birthweight. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of women delivering between 2000-2008 with polysomnogram confirmed OSA in an academic center. Normal weight and obese controls were randomly selected from a perinatal database at a 1:1 ratio. Charts were reviewed for diagnosis, pregnancy and neonatal data. Maternal and neonatal characteristics were compared between groups. Analyses were performed to evaluate maternal characteristics, neonatal birthweight and prematurity. Results: The cohorts included 57 women with OSA, 57 normal weight and 57 obese controls. The OSA cohort had a median AHI of 22.7 (IQ range 12- 47) and median lowest oxygen saturation of 86 %( IQ 7789). Compared to obese controls, the OSA cohort was older (30 vs. 26 yrs, p<0.001), had a higher BMI (49.9 vs. 44.4 kg/m2, p<0.001), more chronic hypertension (51.9 vs. 10.7%, p<0.001) and more diabetes, (24.1 vs. 3%, p<0.001). The OSA cohort had higher rates of very low birthweight (11.1% vs. 1.8%, p=0.04), low birthweight (23.1 vs. 7.1%, p=0.02), prematurity (30.2 vs. 7.1%, p=0.002) and preeclampsia (17.6 vs. 8.9%, p=0.05). Even larger differences were observed when the OSA group was compared to normal weight controls. Among all full term deliveries, there was no difference in very low birthweight and low birthweight. Birthweight was highest in the full term neonates of OSA mothers. Large for gestational age neonates were noted in 20, 12 and 2% of the cohort (for the OSA, obese controls and normal weight controls, respectively). Conclusion: OSA during pregnancy is associated with a high prevalence of prematurity. The relatively high birthweight of full term offspring of mothers with OSA may also indicate an increased risk of later life health problems for these infants.

N2  - Introduction: Previous work showed increased 24-hour illumination measured by wrist actigraphy was associated with shorter sleep latency and reduced wake after sleep onset in postmenopausal women. The aim of the present study was to replicate these findings using polysomnography (PSG). We hypothesized that increased ambient daylight would be associated with enhanced PSG sleep quality variables in both healthy and depressed menopausal women. Methods: In 29 menopausal women, 11 normal controls (NC; mean age=56.7+7.3 years) and 18 depressed patients (DP; mean age=51.9+5.0 years) who met DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode, sleep was recorded by PSG. Hours of ambient daylight were determined from U.S. Naval Observatory sunrise/sunset tables [http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS-OneYear.php]. Pearson correlations were calculated to examine the relationship between hours of ambient daylight and PSG variables. Results: Pearson correlations revealed a similar pattern of results for both NC and DP women. Consequently, NC and DP women were combined for subsequent analysis. For combined NC and DP, hours of ambient daylight was positively associated with total sleep time (TST; r=.56, p=.002); sleep efficiency (SE; r=.45, p=.013); stage 3 minutes (r=.44, p=.018); stage 3 percent (r=.48, p=.009); REM minutes (r=.41, p=.029); and negatively associated with sleep latency (SL; r=-.41, p=.028); wake after sleep onset (WASO; r=-.59, p=.001); and REM latency (r=-.45, p=.015). Conclusion: These results confirm previous findings and support the hypothesis that increased day length is associated with improved sleep in menopausal women (i.e., increased TST and SE and decreased SL and WASO) and increased measures of deeper, restorative sleep (i.e., stage 3 and REM sleep) as measured by PSG. These findings are also consistent with results from a sample of pregnant and postpartum healthy and depressed women presented by our group.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep changes in women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. No studies have elucidated clear associations between alterations in sleep duration, timing, or quality and postpartum depressive symptoms, and hypomanic symptoms have not been examined with regard to sleep. This ongoing study begins to address this gap. Methods: Six women (ages 31.1±4.6 yrs) enrolled from May-August 2008. Participants wore wrist actigraphs and kept daily sleep diaries for 1 week during the 3rd trimester (3rdT) and postpartum weeks 1, 2, 6, and 12. Sleep onset (SleepOn), sleep offset (SleepOff), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SLEF), and sleep period time (SPT) were estimated from actigraphy data using the Sadeh algorithm (1994) in Action-W software (AMI, Ardsley, NY). We gave the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) for depressive symptoms and the Altaian Self-Rating Mania Scale (Altaian) for hypomanic symptoms at the end of each week. Data are presented from 3rdT and postpartum week 2 (Wk2). Results: Mean SPT was significantly shorter during 3rdT (488±34 min) than Wk2 (590±26 min, t=-6.15, p<.01), yet average TST did not differ (3rdT=427±28 min, Wk2=402±47, t=1.07, p=.33). Average SLEF reflects this phenomenon: 3rdT=88.2±4.9%, Wk2=69.3±8.6% (t=5.04, p<.01). Mean SleepOn was 23:17±74 min for 3rdT and 22:39±53 min for Wk2 (t=1.70, p=.15) and mean SleepOff was 7:22±55 min for 3rdT and 8:28±49 min for Wk2 (t=-3.40, p=.02). All women were euthymic during 3rdT (means: CES-D=5.2±2.5; Altman=1.0±1.1) with individual differences emerging in Wk2 (means: CES-D=9.3±7.1; Altman=1.5±1.2). Correlation coefficients computed for postpartum TST vs. postpartum mood showed no significant associations in this small sample: CES-D vs. TST: r=-.20 (p=.71); Altman vs. TST: r=-.05 (p=.93). Correlation coefficients associating postpartum mood to changes in sleep timing were more promising, particularly for hypomanic symptoms: Altman vs. SleepOn Change: r=.82 (p<.05); Altman vs. SleepOff Change: r=.68 (p=.14); CES-D vs. SleepOn Change: r=.19 (p=.72); CES-D vs. SleepOff Change: r=.48 (p=.34). Conclusion: These data confirm that substantial changes in sleep behavior occur during the early postpartum period. Concomitant mood changes may be related more to altered sleep timing rather than to sleep amount. These data from a small sample and a period associated with mood lability will be expanded with future analyses that include more women and data from postpartum weeks 6 and 12.

N2  - Introduction: Mobius sequence (MbS) is a rare congenital disorder and its primary diagnostic criteria are congenital facial and abducens nerve palsy. Mental retardation and autism, involvement of other cranial nerves and limb malformations are also described in MbS. This sequence is frequently described as a sporadic condition, but dominant, recessive auto- somal and even X-linked recessive inheritances have been described. In our series most cases are related to the misuse of misoprostol during the first three months of pregnancy. There is evidence of a lesion of the central pathways in the brainstem, as part of the syndrome. However, there are very few studies reporting neurophysiological aspects of MbS. Methods: Twelve patients with MbS were evaluated. Age ranged from 4 to 16 years (8 girls and 4 boys, mean age: 8,58 ± 3,9). All patients underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) with standard parameters. Sleep stages and respiratory events were scored according to standard criteria. All values are expressed in mean with standard deviation. Results: PSG findings were: Sleep efficiency (%): 84,68 ± 5,35; Sleep distribution (%): S1 (5,22 ± 3,33), S2 (53,6 ± 8,41), S3 (1,63 ± 0,62), S4 (18,29 ± 7,33), REM (10,37 ± 5,41); Sleep latency (min): 22,88 ± 16,61; REM latency (min): 233,28 ± 67,95; Arousal index: 6,37 ± 1,94; Apnea- hypopnea index (AHI): 4,17 ± 4,12; SpO2(%): mean (97,29 ± 1,71) and lowest(90,42 ± 3,15). Conclusion: Our study suggests that patients with MbS have reduced sleep efficiency, and a remarkably increased REM latency associated with reduced REM amount. As REM sleep is generated by a complex neuronal interaction in the brainstem, which is the principal site of lesion in these patients, it is quite challenging the understanding of sleep mechanisms in these patients.

N2  - Introduction: Research focusing on the role of fathers in the development of infant sleep has been very limited. The goals of this longitudinal study were to assess: (a) The differences in nighttime interventions between mothers and fathers. (b) The concomitant and predictive links between infant sleep patterns and paternal vs. maternal involvement in overall infant care during the first year of life.Methods: Fifty-six couples were recruited during pregnancy and were asked after delivery (1, 6, and 12 months) to complete a questionnaire aimed at assessing the relative involvement of mothers vs. fathers in infant care (e.g. bathing, playing). Infant sleep was assessed at the age of 6 and 12 months using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Parental nighttime soothing was assessed by rating scales included in the sleep diary. Results: Differences between mothers and fathers in frequency, duration and method of night soothing were found. At 6 months mothers demonstrated longer duration of intervention (F = 7.99, p < .01) and a higher degree of active nighttime soothing (F = 6.84, p < .05). The findings demonstrated significant concomitant and predictive links between infant sleep and relative involvement of mothers vs. fathers in infant care. According to the ratings of both parents, higher paternal involvement in infant care predicted and was associated with a lower number of objective (actigraphic) and reported infant night-wakings and with shorter sleep duration. For instance, according to the fathers' ratings, the predictive correlation between paternal involvement at 1 month and actigraphic night-waking s at 6 months was - .35 (p<.01) and the concomitant correlation at 6 months was -.38 (p<.005). Conclusion: The results suggest that paternal involvement in infant care may contribute significantly to the development of infant sleep. The findings highlight the importance of including fathers in developmental and clinical sleep research.

N2  - Introduction: Our understanding of sleep architecture and impact of sleep quality on overall health outcomes in the ICU is not known. Sleep disruption can contribute to outcomes such as delirium which independently increases mortality in this patient population. Patients weaning from mechanical ventilation are a homogenous population in the ICU as they are resolving from an acute illness. This population may be most vulnerable to affects of poor quality of sleep. However, sleep architecture in this group has not been extensively studied. The two common modes of weaning used in our ICU is pressure support ventilation (PSV) and trach mask trials (TMT). However, to what extent these weaning methods contribute to abnormalities in sleep architecture is not known. Methods: Prospective observational study at London Health Sciences Critical Care Trauma Centre. Patients were included if they were mechanically ventilated for >24 hours and met weaning criteria by the ICU team. Patients recovering from general anesthesia, pregnancy, hemody- namically unstable, have neuromuscular disease, and who have documented brain injury were excluded from the study. Twenty-four hour attended continuous PSG was recorded. Results: To-date we have recorded 7 patients ( age=76 yo; male=5). We report results (n=4) from an ongoing study that shows reduced mean sleep efficiency in patients weaning from mechanical ventilation (PSV= 23%; TMT=48%). REM sleep was recorded in both patient populations (mean % total sleep period PSV= 3.5%; TMT=20%). Conclusion: Our observational study to-date suggests that sleep architecture is abnormal in this patient population. While REM sleep is reduced in the PSV group, our preliminary assessment suggests that there is adequate REM sleep in the TMT group. Our study will establish baseline data for a population that is not available in the literature.

N2  - Introduction: Previously conducted studies suggest that the pathophysiology of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in children most likely involves several mechanisms including anatomic and metabolic components. In addition, recent research has yielded evidence of the negative impact that obesity, low socioeconomic status, minority race, prematurity and maternal smoking during pregnancy can have on children, and how these factors are related to the development of SDB. In this study, we investigated the association between parent reported prenatal and perinatal complications and SDB. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 613 children (105 clinically referred and 508 community controls) ages 4-17 who all underwent an overnight polysomnography, and complete history and physical examination. A comprehensive child development questionnaire was completed by a parent. We compared clinically referred children with SDB as defined by an Apnea/Hyponea Index >5 (AHI) to healthy population based controls from The Penn State Children's Cohort (AHI<1). Results: In unadjusted and adjusted (race and socioeconomic status) analyses, prenatal complications such as maternal high blood pressure and gestational diabetes, perinatal complications related to prematurity and labor and delivery as well as neurodevelopmental delay (i.e., motor milestones) were significantly associated the presence of childhood SDB. Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that there is a strong association between children who experience prenatal and perinatal distress and the development of moderate to severe childhood SDB even after adjusting for race and socioeconomic status. The developmental motor delays suggest that these stressors may result in brain injury which in turn may effect nighttime breathing.

N2  - Introduction: Human victims of prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) and rodents treated with alcohol during perinatal period exhibit sleep abnormalities that may extend into adulthood, but the underlying neural substrate(s) are unknown. We investigated whether early AE alters GABAergic system in hypothalamic regions important for the regulation of sleep and motor activity. Methods: Male rats received 5.25 g/kg/day of alcohol via intragastric intubations during postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period equivalent to human brain development during the third trimester of pregnancy (AE group). Control pups were sham-intubated (S group). On PD15-16, total RNA and protein were bilaterally extracted from 700 μ tissue micropunches from the wake-promoting, perifornical (PF) region of the posterior hypo- thalamus and sleep-promoting, ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) region of the anterior hypothalamus. GAD levels (mRNA and protein) and mRNA levels for eleven subunits of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) were quantified using RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively (n=5-7/group). In additional animals (n=9-10/group), motor activity was recorded for 30 min using infrared beam-splitting technique. Results: In the PF region, GAD65/67 immunoreactivity and GAD67 mRNA levels were significantly lower (by 44% and 24%, respectively; p<0.01 for both), and in the VLPO region, GAD65/67 immunoreactivity (but not mRNA) was lower (by 8%; p<0.05) in the AE group. GABAAR α4 and σ subunit mRNA levels were higher in the PF region and α3 and υ;2 subunit mRNA levels were higher in the VLPO region (p<0.05) in the AE group. The total number of movements was significantly higher in AE than S rats (by 36%; p<0.05). Conclusion: Perinatal AE results in reduced levels of hypothalamic GABA enzymatic precursor, GAD, in both sleep and wake-related hy- pothalamic regions, and opposite changes in expression of mRNA for GABARs, when measured five days after the exposure period. Deficient hypothalamic GABAergic mechanisms may contribute to motor hyperactivity and disrupted sleep in victims of perinatal AE.

N2  - Study Objective: To determine whether preconceptional psychological distress is associated with infant sleep disturbance. Design: Prospective cohort study Setting: Southampton, UK. Participants: A cohort of women from the Southampton Women's Survey (SWS), who were recruited between 20-34 years of age and followed through their subsequent pregnancies and beyond; a total of 874 mother-infant pairs were involved in the study. Measurements and results: Preconceptional psychological distress was measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). When their infants were 6 and 12 months of age, mothers were asked to report the number of times babies woke on average between the hours of midnight and 06:00 each night during a 2-week period. Preconceptional psychological distress was a strong predictor of infant night waking at both 6 and 12 months of age, independent of the effects of postnatal depression, bedroom sharing, and other confounding factors. At 6 months, preconceptional distress was associated with a 23% increased risk of waking (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.44), and at 12 months with a 22% increased risk (PR 1.22, 95% confdence intervals [CI] 1.02-1.46). Conclusions: Women with preconceptional psychological distress are more likely to have babies with sleep disturbance during infancy, independent of whether they suffered from postnatal depression.

N2  - Introduction: An important predictor of the presence and severity of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is the anatomical patency of the upper airway. An increased Mallampati grade (MP; a simple airway classification used to determine risk for difficult intubation) has been reported during pregnancy. Increased MP (i.e., grades III/IV) is also associated with SDB. However, no study has investigated whether MP III/IV may identify women at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods: A medical record review was undertaken of women admitted to the labor and delivery unit between September 2005 - September 2008. Results of routine airway assessments by anesthesiologists were obtained, as were diagnoses of chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and pre-eclampsia. Route of delivery was also obtained. Results: A total of 7251 records were analyzed. Mean age was 29.3±5.9 years and mean BMI was 31.3±6.6Kg/m2. Ten percent of women had gestational hypertension (including 5.6% with pre-eclampsia). Thirty percent of women were delivered by caesarean section. Women with MP III/IV were more likely to have gestational hypertension (16% vs. 9%; p<0.001) as well as pre-eclampsia (10% vs. 5%; p<0.001) compared to women with MP I/II. MP III/IV was also associated with caesarean section (43% vs.29%; p<0.001). In a logistic regression, MP III/ IV was independently associated with pre-eclampsia (odds ratio of 1.7, 95%CI 1.2-2.3; p=0.002) after adjusting for age, parity, gestational age, and BMI. Also, MP III/IV was associated with having a caesarean section (adjusted odds ratio of 1.6, 95%CI 1.0-2.4; p<0.05) including birth weight and previous caesarean section in the model. Results were similar in the sub-group of primiparous women. Conclusion: Mallampati grade may be useful in identifying women at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pre-eclampsia and caesarean section. The association between Mallampati grade and SDB also raises the possibility that SDB may play a role in adverse pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Activity-rest behaviour of 11 neonates whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy (s-group) and 11 neonates of non-smoking mothers (ns-group) born by Caesarean section (all born in the thirty-seventh to forty-second week of gestation) was monitored for six successive days starting in the first week of life. Actigraphy was used to record time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using Actiwatch actometers. In addition, a standardised diary was kept regularly. Amount of sleep time during daytime, night time, and 24h, as well as sleep bouts during daytime and night time, were compared. Both groups showed a significant difference in amount of night time sleep vs. daytime sleep, with more sleep at night time. Many adverse effects of smoking during pregnancy are known. We could not, however, detect significant differences in the amount of night time sleep, daytime sleep, and 24h sleep time between the s- and ns-group neonates.

N2  - Introduction: Few studies have examined the relationship between maternal depression and sleep in offspring beyond very early childhood. In a study of mothers of children 4-7 years old, women at risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) completed measures designed to assess relationships between maternal depression and their child's sleep. Methods: Mothers at risk for MDD (N = 118) who had previously completed a series of mood assessments (prenatally through 6 months postpartum) were re-contacted 4-7 years after their last assessment to complete the study. MDD was assessed at index pregnancy visit using structured interview. At the recent follow-up, these measures were completed by 85 women (72% of those contacted): Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Child Behavior Checklist-Sleep Problems subscale (CBC-SP), and BEARS pediatric sleep screen. T-tests and regression analyses assessed relationships between maternal mood and child's sleep. Results: Sixteen women (5%) met criteria for MDD at the time of study (BDI-II >20), and 39 (46%) reported symptoms consistent with current or past MDD. As compared to mothers without current MDD, children of women with current MDD had greater total BEARS scores (1.4 versus 2.12, p = .003) and CBC-SP subscale scores (2.94 versus 5, p = .02).Across the sample, BEARS snoring and napping items accounted for 17% of the variance in BDI-II score (p = .03), and awakening and snoring items accounted for 14% of the variance in past MDD history (p = 002). For women with current MDD, CBC-SP subscale score accounted for 53% of the variance in BDI-II score (p=.005). Children of mothers with MDD have more sleep difficulties as compared to women without MDD. Disruption on several child sleep variables was associated with greater maternal BDI-II scores. These results are consistent with previous findings and further confirm the relationship between maternal depression and child sleep problems.

N2  - Introduction: Approximately 13% of infants born in the United States each year are delivered prematurely (before 37 weeks gestation). Premature infants born between 33 and 35 weeks gestational age and <1500 grams have more irregular sleep/wake patterns than those born fullterm. Mothers of premature infants view their child as more vulnerable (i.e., more susceptible to health problems) than do mothers of full-term infants. The purpose of the current study was to investigate sleep-related cognitions and perceptions of mothers of prematurely born infants. Methods: Maternal cognitions and perceptions of premature infant sleep were assessed using two measures: the Maternal Cognitions about Infant Sleep Questionnaire (MCISQ) and the Vulnerable Child Scale (VCS). Lower scores on the VCS reflect greater maternal belief of infant vulnerability. The MCISQ doubt subscale score was used, with higher scores representing more negative maternal concerns and doubts about infant sleep. Infant birth and medical history data were also collected. Results: The sample consisted of 19 infants born at 29.3 (SD+8.5) weeks with birth weight of 3.1 (SD+2.1) pounds. The infants spent 35.9 (SD+ 40.7) days on oxygen and 16.5 (SD+15.1) days on mechanical ventilation. VCS scores were negatively correlated with MCISQ doubt subscale (r=-.47, p<0.05). VCS scores were also significantly different between infants who had never had reflux compared to those who had a history of or concurrent reflux (t (17) = -16.3, p<0.01). Conclusion: Mothers who viewed their infant as vulnerable were more likely to doubt their parental competency relating to their infant's sleep. Mothers viewed premature infants who had a persistent case of reflux as more vulnerable. Premature infants presenting with reflux tend to have less gastro-motility than other infants, making them fussier during the day and more restless during sleep. Thus, reflux may contribute to both poor infant sleep and maternal perception that the infant is more vulnerable.

N2  - Introduction: Emerging data suggests that maternal habitual snoring may be a risk factor for adverse fetal outcome such as lower birth-weight and reduced Apgar scores. However, the small available literature is conflicting. Given the potential impact of habitual snoring on fetal outcome, data are urgently required to address this significant public health issue. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether habitual snoring in the last trimester of pregnancy is associated with adverse infant outcome. Methods: Women carrying a single fetus were recruited during their last trimester of pregnancy and invited to complete several sleep questionnaires. Habitual snoring was defined as snoring ≥3 nights/week. Following delivery, medical records were reviewed to determine infant outcomes. Results: In total, 429 women (mean age 30.1±5.8 years) have been studied as part of an ongoing investigation. Thirty-five percent reported habitual snoring and 25% were obese (BMI≥30kg/m2). No differences were found in birth-weight between infants born to women with and without habitual snoring (3.29±0.7kg vs. 3.28±0.6kg respectively). Similarly, no differences were found in 1 or 5 minute Apgar scores (7.3±1.9 vs. 7.7±1.8kg and 8.6±1.1 vs. 8.7±1.1 respectively). There was a tendency for the habitual snorers to have 1 and 5 minute Apgar scores ≤7 (34% vs. 25% and 11% vs. 6%) although this did not reach statistical significance (p≤0.16). In a regression model including habitual snoring, presence of diabetes, maternal age, and race, only gestational age at delivery, and pre-pregnancy BMI were independent predictors of birth-weight (adjusted R2 0.31 p<0.001) and 1-minute Apgar (adjusted R2 0.42, p=0.001). Only gestational age at delivery was predictive of 5-minute Apgar score (adjusted R2 0.31, p=0.002). Conclusion: Contrary to several reports, our findings do not support the hypothesis that habitual snoring in pregnancy is a predictor of adverse infant outcomes such as lower birth-weight or poor Apgar scores.

N2  - Introduction: Because RLS is associated with iron deficiency, and iron absorption requires acidic gastric pH, we questioned whether PPI use, which reduces gastric acidity, may be associated with increased frequency of RLS. Methods: This is a prospective cross-sectional study of 400 consecutive adults undergoing upper endoscopy (EGD). Patients were interviewed before EGD and excluded if they had conditions predisposing to RLS (current pregnancy, end-stage renal disease, peripheral neuropathy); Conditions associated with iron deficiency (total/partial gastrectomy, recent GI neoplasm); And recent therapy known to improve RLS symptoms. RLS was diagnosed using the four criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. For each patient, we documented PPI usage, Epworth Sleepiness Score, our 6 point Subjective Sleep Quality Score, and indication for EGD. Results: Data from our first 110 of 400 anticipated participants (68 F, 42 M; average age 55 ± 17.7 y) showed a prevalence of RLS and PPI use of 14.5% (16/110) and 44.5% (49/110) respectively. RLS prevalence was higher among PPI users [20.4% (10/49)] compared with PPI non-users [9.8% (6/61)], but this difference lacked significance (P = 0.125). RLS was diagnosed in 27.0% (10/37) of patients with the EGD indication of abdominal pain/dyspepsia compared with 8.2% (6/73) without this complaint (P = 0.012). RLS was not associated with other EGD indications. Subjective Sleep Quality Score and Epworth Sleepiness Score did not differ significantly among those with and without RLS, PPI users and non-users, or patients with RLS regardless of their PPI usage. Conclusion: RLS occurred frequently among patients undergoing EGD, particularly when abdominal pain/dyspepsia was the EGD indication. The trend for increased RLS prevalence among PPI users may have lacked significance due to true absence of association or insufficient power at this stage of the study.

N2  - Introduction: Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is rare disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia, cognitive disturbances, compulsive eating and hyper sexuality. Increased Jewish predisposition was observed in one study. The clinical profle of Israeli KLS cases was previously found to be very similar to the clinical presentation of KLS world-wide. The aim of the study was to investigate environmental variables that may be involved in the onset of KLS. Methods: Thirty-three KLS patients (82% male) were recruited; clinical profle was previously described (APSS 2007). Ethnic and gender matched controls defned by grandparents' origin were also recruited. All patients, their parents and matched controls completed a detailed questionnaire containing 84 questions on environmental factors, way of life and development aspects during childhood. Results: The following variables were found to distinguish KLS cases prior to onset compared to controls: living in an agricultural versus urban environment (p=0.006), living at altitude below 500 meters (p< 0.0001), lower rate of completed vaccination schedule (p< 0.001), higher rate of living environment changes (p=0.01) and sleep habits changes (p=0.01), more frequent recent initiation of the frst intimate relationships (p=0.01), higher rate of discharge from military service (p=0.01), higher rate of recent change in economic status (p=0.003), higher rate of recent spouse pregnancy (p=0.001), higher rate of recent child birth (p=0.001), and a lower rate of normal development, a higher rate of learning diffculties (p = 0.01) and a lower rate of appropriate gestational age at birth. Conclusion: These fndings suggest that specifc environmental factors contribute to KLS onset.

N2  - Study Objectives: Pregnant women have an increased risk of experiencing restless legs syndrome (RLS). Aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between pregnancy-related hormonal and metabolic changes and RLS symptomatology. Design: Blood measurements and overnight polysomnography were performed during the third trimester of pregnancy and again 3 months after delivery. We investigated blood hormonal levels (estradiol, prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], iron, ferritin, hemoglobin) and polysomno-graphic sleep parameters. Subjective sleep quality and RLS symptoms were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the International RLS study group (IRLSSG) rating scale. Setting: Sleep laboratory. Participants: Ten pregnant women fulfilling the IRLSSG criteria for RLS diagnosis and 9 pregnant healthy controls underwent the protocol. Interventions: N/A. Results: Women with RLS showed higher levels of estradiol during pregnancy compared to controls (34,211 ± 6,397 pg/mL vs. 25,475 ± 7,990 pg/mL, P < 0.05). Patients also showed more periodic limb movements (PLMs) before and after delivery, particularly during sleep stage 1 and wakefulness (P < 0.05). PLMs decreased postpartum in subjects with RLS only (P < 0.05); sleep efficiency increased in women without RLS and remained unchanged in patients (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between groups before or after delivery in plasma concentrations of prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, FSH, LH, iron, ferritin or hemoglobin. Conclusions: RLS in pregnant women goes along with transiently increased estradiol levels and PLM indices suggesting that estrogens play a pathophysiological role for triggering RLS symptoms during pregnancy.

N2  - The circadian oscillator is generated within the suprachiasmatic nuclei and synchronizes circadian clocks in numerous peripheral tissues. The molecular basis is composed of a number of genes and proteins that form transcriptional and translational feedback loops. Such molecular oscillators are also operative in peripheral tissues, including in the uterus. Although ovarian steroids regulate the function of uterine endometrial stromal cells, the modulation of ovarian steroids on the circadian rhythms remains unknown. Here we investigate the possibility that estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) modulate the circadian oscillator of the stromal cells. The study using transgenic rats constructed with Period 2 (Per2) promoter-destabilized luciferase (Per2-dLuc) gene, with the real-time monitoring system of Per2-dLuc oscillation. The stromal cells displayed constant Per2-dLuc oscillation after treatment with dexamethasone, suggesting that the circadian oscillator is operative. However, the circadian oscillator was disrupted by in vivo administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) following equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), although it was altered into a rhythmic pattern 4 days later following hCG. Chronic treatment with P4 induced constant Per2-dLuc oscillation in the stromal cells from eCG-treated immature and pregnant rats, whereas E2 did not promote such a rhythmic Per2-dLuc oscillation. Collectively, P4 synchronizes the circadian oscillator of the uterus endometrial stromal cells through transcriptional and translational feedback loops of the clockwork system. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008.

N2  - Background: Current use of treated mosquito nets for the prevention of malaria falls short of what is expected in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), though research within the continent has indicated that the use of these commodities can reduce malaria morbidity by 50% and malaria mortality by 20%. Governments in sub-Sahara Africa are investing substantially in scaling-up treated mosquito net coverage for impact. However, certain significant factors still prevent the use of the treated mosquito nets, even among those who possess them. This survey examines household ownership as well as use and non-use of treated mosquito nets in Sahel Savannah and Niger Delta regions of Nigeria. Methodology: This survey employed cross-sectional survey to collect data from households on coverage and use of mosquito nets, whether treated or not. Fever episodes in previous two weeks among children under the age of five were also recorded. The study took place in August 1 - 14 2007, just five months after the March distribution of treated mosquito nets, coinciding with the second raining period of the year and a time of high malaria transmission during the wet season. EPI INFO version 2003 was used in data analysis. Results: The survey covered 439 households with 2,521 persons including 739 under-fives, 585 women in reproductive age and 78 pregnant women in Niger Delta Region and Sahel Savannah Region. Of the 439 HHs, 232 had any mosquito nets. Significantly higher proportion of households in the Niger Delta Region had any treated or untreated mosquito nets than those in the Sahel Savannah Region. In the Niger Delta Region, the proportion of under-fives that had slept under treated nets the night before the survey exceeded those that slept under treated nets in the Sahel Savannah Region. Children under the age of five years in the Niger Delta Region were four times more likely to sleep under treated nets than those in the Sahel Savannah Region. Conclusion: This study found that despite the fact that treated nets were distributed widely across Nigeria, the use of this commodity was still very low in the Sahel Savannah region. Future campaigns should include more purposeful social and health education on the importance and advantages of the use of treated nets to save lives in the Sahel Savannah region of Nigeria.

N2  - Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity have become two of the main threats to public health in the Western world. In addition, obesity is the most important determinant of the sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS), a condition that adversely affects glucose metabolism. However, it is unknown whether patients with diabetes have more severe SAHS than non-diabetic subjects. The aim of this cross-sectional case-control study was to evaluate whether obese patients with T2DM are more prone to severe SAHS than obese non-diabetic subjects. Methodology/Principal Findings: Thirty obese T2DM and 60 non-diabetic women closely matched by age, body mass index, waist circumference, and smoking status were recruited from the outpatient Obesity Unit of a university hospital. The exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory disease, smoking habit, neuromuscular and cerebrovascular disease, alcohol abuse, use of sedatives, and pregnancy. Examinations included a non-attended respiratory polygraphy, pulmonary function testing, and an awake arterial gasometry. Oxygen saturation measures included the percentage of time spent at saturations below 90% (CT90). A high prevalence of SAHS was found in both groups (T2DM:80%, nondiabetic:78.3%). No differences in the number of sleep apnea-hypopnea events between diabetic and non-diabetic patients were observed. However, in diabetic patients, a significantly increase in the CT90 was detected (20.2±30.2% vs. 6.8±13,5%; p = 0.027). In addition, residual volume (RV) was significantly higher in T2DM (percentage of predicted: 79.7±18.1 vs. 100.1±22.8; p,0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that T2DM but not RV was independently associated with CT90. Conclusions/Significance: T2DM adversely affects breathing during sleep, becoming an independent risk factor for severe nocturnal hypoxemia in obese patients. Given that SAHS is a risk factor of cardiovascular disease, the screening for SAHS in T2DM patients seems mandatory. © 2009 Lecube et al.

N2  - Pregnancy is associated with many physiologic and hormonal changes along with changes in sleep architecture, placing pregnant women at risk for the development of sleep-disordered breathing or worsening of preexisting sleep apnea. Snoring, the most common symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, is markedly increased during pregnancy. The exact prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women is unknown. Because the apneic episodes are commonly associated with oxyhemoglobin desaturations, the combination of obstructive sleep apnea and pregnancy can be potentially harmful to the fetus given the low oxygen reserves during pregnancy. Obstructive sleep apnea has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension among the general population, and this raises the possibility of its association with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. In this clinical review, we discuss the physiologic changes of pregnancy that predispose pregnant women to the development of obstructive sleep apnea and the effects of sleep-disordered breathing on pregnancy outcomes. We also review the recommendations regarding evaluation for sleep apnea and treatment options during pregnancy and postpartum.

N2  - Hypertension develops in 10% of pregnancies. Snoring, a marker of obstructive sleep apnoea, is a newly identified risk factor for gestational hypertension. Moreover, obstructive sleep apnoea is an independent risk factor for incident hypertension in the non-pregnant population. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with new onset of hypertension among pregnant females. A case-control study was performed involving 17 pregnant females with gestational hypertension and 33 pregnant females without hypertension. Subjects were frequency-matched for gestational age and recruited in a tertiary obstetrical centre. Obstructive sleep apnoea was ascertained by polysomnography and defined by an apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) of ≥15 events·h-1, without requirement for desaturation. The mean±SD AHI for normotensive pregnant females was 18.2±12.2 events·h-1 compared with 38.6±36.7 events·h-1 for females with hypertensive pregnancies. The crude odds ratio for the presence of obstructive sleep apnoea given the presence of gestational hypertension was 5.6. The odds ratio was 7.5 (95% confidence interval 3.5-16.2), based on a logistic regression model with adjustment for maternal age, gestational age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, prior pregnancies, and previous live births. In conclusion, gestational hypertension appears to be strongly associated with the presence of obstructive sleep apnoea. Copyright©ERS Journals Ltd 2009.

N2  - The "disk-over-water" method, where animals are awakened by disk rotation triggered by sleep EEG signals, was efficiently used in many studies involving sleep deprivation. Recently, the modification of this method has been developed where, during the period of deprivation, the disk was rotated in accordance with a pre-set program (the "disk-over-water" method without feedback). We considered this modification as a potentially promising one for investigation of relationship between maternal sleep and litter development. However, none of these methods has been used in experiments on female rats, and efficiency of the method without feedback has never been tested using electrophysiological estimation of sleep-wake states either. Performing these tasks was the goal of the present study. Cortical EEG, hippocampal theta-activity and locomotor activity were recorded in 14 female Wistar rats underwent sleep deprivation in the "disk-over-water" setup without feedback. Three days long during the deprivation periods from 11:00 to 14:00 the disk was rotated for 8 s with 15 s intervals. REM sleep was totally eliminated during these periods, and amounts of slow wave sleep did not exceed 10% of 3 h. The results were identical both for pregnant and non-pregnant rats. The rate of sleep reduction during deprivation periods in our experimental conditions did not differ from that in the original system with the feedback. Thus the simplified "disk-over-water" method without feedback can be used in the studies involving relatively short sleep deprivation periods.

N2  - The United States is in the midst of an obesity crisis. The majority of American women of childbearing age are overweight or obese. The presence of excess body weight in a woman can negatively impact fertility, pregnancy, postnatal recovery, and the health of her child. Psychiatric comorbidities, including eating and mood disorders, can influence nutrition and weight gain during pregnancy and weight loss in the postpartum period. Stress associated with caretaking in the postpartum period impacts levels of sleep and physical activity, which further impact postpartum weight retention. This article reviews the literature in these areas; the article discusses the management of excess body weight during and after pregnancy as well as related psychiatric conditions in pregnant and postpartum women. © MBL Communications.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to explore the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms and anxiety across pregnancy and the early postpartum. Methods: Participants (N = 207) completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Trait subscale, Beck Depression Inventory, and social support and sleep quality measures at two time points during pregnancy and once in the early postpartum period. Results: After accounting for the relative stability of anxiety and depression over time, depressive symptoms earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of anxiety in late pregnancy and anxiety in late pregnancy predicted higher depressive symptomatology in the early postpartum. A bi-directional model of depression and anxiety in pregnancy was supported. Limitations: Data were based on self-reports and participating women were predominantly tertiary educated with high family incomes. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms precede the development of higher levels of anxiety and that anxiety, even at non-clinical levels, can predict higher depressive symptoms. Clinicians are advised to screen for anxiety and depression concurrently during pregnancy. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - An approach combining time-continuous nonlinear stability analysis and a parametric bispectral method was introduced to better describe cortical activation and deactivation patterns in the immature fetal electroencephalogram (EEG). Signal models and data-driven investigations were performed to find optimal parameters of the nonlinear methods and to confirm the occurrence of nonlinear sections in the fetal EEG. The resulting measures were applied to the in utero electrocorticogram (ECoG) of fetal sheep at 0.7 gestation when organized sleep states were not developed and compared to previous results at 0.9 gestation. Cycling of the nonlinear stability of the fetal ECoG occurred already at this early gestational age, suggesting the presence of premature sleep states. This was accompanied by cycling of the time-variant biamplitude which reflected ECoG synchronization effects during premature sleep states associated with nonrapid eye movement sleep later in gestation. Thus, the combined nonlinear and time-variant approach was able to provide important insights into the properties of the immature fetal ECoG.

N2  - Post-natal exposure to air pollution is associated with diminished lung growth during school age. The current authors aimed to determine whether pre-natal exposure to air pollution is associated with lung function changes in the newborn. In a prospective birth cohort of 241 healthy term-born neonates, tidal breathing, lung volume, ventilation inhomogeneity and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) were measured during unsedated sleep at age 5 weeks. Maternal exposure to particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm (PM 10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), and distance to major roads were estimated during pregnancy. The association between these exposures and lung function was assessed using linear regression. Minute ventilation was higher in infants with higher pre-natal PM10 exposure (24.9 mL·min-1 per μg·m-3 PM 10). The eNO was increased in infants with higher pre-natal NO 2 exposure (0.98 ppb per mg?m-3 NO2). Post-natal exposure to air pollution did not modify these findings. No association was found for pre-natal exposure to O3 and lung function parameters. The present results suggest that pre-natal exposure to air pollution might be associated with higher respiratory need and airway inflammation in newborns. Such alterations during early lung development may be important regarding long-term respiratory morbidity. Copyright©ERS Journals Ltd 2009.

N2  - Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is commonly used although clinical studies questioned its diagnostic value. Sophisticated FHR variability (fHRV) measures such as fHRV complexity may improve the sensitivity and specificity of FHR monitoring. A more detailed understanding of the physiology underlying fHRV complexity is essential to harness its use for monitoring fetal health. To examine the specific effects of vagal and sympathetic modulations on fHRV complexity, we blocked vagal activity with atropine and sympathetic activity with propranolol in near-term fetal sheep (n = 7, 0.85 gestation). Under these conditions, we analyzed the linear and nonlinear parts of fHRV complexity from autonomic information flow. Overall fHRV complexity decreased with both drugs compared with nonrapid eye movement sleep baseline (P < 0.05). With atropine, this was because of a decrease of the linear part of fHRV complexity on the long-term time scale (P < 0.05), suggesting that vagal modulation of fHRV is adequately described by linear fHRV measures. With propranolol, the nonlinear part of fHRV complexity decreased on the short-term time scale (P < 0.05), suggesting that sympathetic influences on fHRV can be detected by the nonlinear part of fHRV complexity. Thus the complex interplay of vagal and sympathetic modulations of fHRV is reflected differently and specifically in the linear and nonlinear properties of fHRV complexity, and on different time scales. Analysis of linear and nonlinear properties of fHRV may improve sensitivity and specificity of FHR monitoring. Copyright © 2009 the American Physiological Society.

N2  - Day-care surgery in Norway and Scandinavia is, just like in many other-specially western countries - a great success generating a win-win situation for patient and society. Norway is if not a huge country, then a very long country with a scattered settlement except for the fact that more than 60 % of the people are living in the 8 largest cities including the capital area of Oslo. The aim with the medi-hotel system was to enhance medical treatment -due to geographical challenges and expectations from patients and authorities in respect of volume, flexibility, service and economics. The medi-hotels together with other initiatives have been a driver for the centralization of the day-care surgery in both more remote areas and in specialized and super-specialized surgical fields in the university-hospital cities. Definitions: Day-care surgery in Scandinavia: • The patient are taken into and are leaving the hospital/clinic on the same day. If the patient stays in the hospital after midnight and/ or are spending the night at the hospital (e.g. a stay of 23 hours) it is not day-care. Medi-motels are in this context the same as Medi-hotels and combines different entities: • Patient-hotel (in Norwegian: 'Pasient-hotell'): For hospitalized patients /family etc. under some kind of treatment. Medical personnel are on call/duty for 24 hours. Situated close to the hospital ('no-wet -shoes' principle). It is estimated that 10 to 20 % of all hospital stays could be managed in this kind of hotel. Usually other patients/family/other visitors can use the facilities if paying. • Ambulatory patient-hotel (in Norwegian: 'Syke-hotell'). No medical personnel on site. Juristically and practically comparable to ordinary hotels. Available to ordinary hotel booking • A mixture of these two facilities. In addition to these 3 types of medi-hotels there is a widespread use of ordinary hotels as 'Ambulatory patient-hotels'. Very often to a reduced rate. In the 'Ambulatory hotel' the patient stays on its own responsibility and there is no medical personnel on site. A. Patient-hotel Conditions in relation to the patient: • Independent of help to dress/undress. • Can eat in cafeteria • Able to walk to and from the nearby hospital department for treatment/examines • No need of continuous observation • Able to administer medication - except for planned i.v. medication etc. • Long distance patients Potential patient groups: • During preoperative assessments • Awaiting treatment • After end of treatment waiting for transport and / or potential early complications to the treatment • During diagnostic procedures and treatment which lasts for days B. Ambulatory patient-hotel Conditions in relation to the patient: • Patients in no expected need of medical assistance other than planned hospital treatment Potential patient groups: • Day-care-treatment including day-care surgery before and after treatment. Middle and long distance patients. • During preoperative assessments • Awaiting treatment • During diagnostic procedures and treatment which lasts for days List of potential users of the medi-hotel: • Healthy woman in confinement with healthy newborn child • Mothers to sick newborn during treatment • Pregnant in need of easy access to delivery department - long distance patients • Palliative and pain treatment • Sleep-registrations • Endocrinological, neurological, nuclear-/X-ray diagnostics / treatment • Chemo-/gyrostatic/biological medicament therapy • Patient-school-participants • ENT-patients before and after treatment (especially children and long distance patients) • Preoperative surgical, orthopaedic and gynaecology patients • Day-care surgical pat. (long distance and / or without relatives) • Pat. which have had anaesthesia • Plastic-surgery patients Economic issues In Norway the are a range of different financing and project-models (4-5) with more or less involvement of the Norwegian state/healthregion in planning, project, ownership and daily management of the medi-hotel. Models for project, ownership and daily management range from 100 % to 0 % public responsibility (the regional health region). The estimated minimal size of the medi-hotel for acceptable results during daily management with standard finanzing are around 70 beds. The estimated building project price per room (45 sq.m.) in a 70 bed medi-hotel with total area of 3.150 sq.m are app. 6000 US$ (35.000 NOK) per sq.m. a total of app. 18 mill. US$ (110.3 million NOK). (Norway 2008 figures). The total cost per day/bed with 70 % occupancy in the above example, including financing and daily costs are app. 200 US$ (NOK: 1145). (Norway 2008 figures). Patient payment: 1. Patient-hotel Stay including all meals are free to the patient, and if it is needed and booked by the hospital: it is free for the accompanied family member(s). The hotel are paid app. 700 NOK (118 US$) /day/ patient and 450 NOK (75 US$) per. relative sharing the room. Payment by the regional health-authority/social municipality Ordinary hotel guests are paying little or often quite less than normal hotel-prices in that geographical area. 2. Ambulatory patient-hotel Often the prices are cheaper than in 'Patient-hotels'. Payment for the patient and - if accepted - the following relative/friend are reimbursed by the same system as mentioned above except for a payment of 100 NOK (16 US$) per night/person. That includes full-board. The future The patient-hotel model has proven its value for the patients and society in Norway. The principle are generally accepted and numbers of medi-hotels are increasing. We can recommend the model.

N2  - Background: Previous studies have suggested that preterm birth with or without subsequent chronic lung disease is associated with reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) and increased ventilation inhomogeneity in the neonatal period. We aimed to establish whether such findings are associated with the degree of prematurity, neonatal respiratory illness and disproportionate somatic growth. Methods: Multiple breath washout measurements using an ultrasonic flowmeter were obtained from 219 infants on 306 test occasions during the first few months of life, at three neonatal units in the UK and Australia. Tests were performed during unsedated sleep in clinically stable infants (assigned to four exclusive diagnostic categories: term controls, preterm controls, respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease). The determinants of neonatal lung function were assessed using multivariable, multilevel modelling. Results: After adjustment for age and body proportions, the factors gestation, intrauterine growth restriction and days of supplemental oxygen were all significantly associated with a reduced FRC. In contrast, increased ventilation inhomogeneity (elevated lung clearance index) was only significantly associated with duration of supplemental oxygen. After adjusting for continuous variables, diagnostic category made no further contribution to the models. Despite using identical techniques, unexpected inter-centre differences occurred, associated with the equipment used; these did not alter the negative association of preterm delivery and disease severity with lung function outcomes. Conclusion: Reduction in FRC is independently associated with prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction and severity of neonatal lung disease. Determinants of lung function shortly after birth are highly complex in different disease groups.

N2  - Very low-birth-weight premature infants often suffer from a variety of respiratory problems, including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), hypopnea and periodic breathing, and apnea. These conditions are likely related to immaturity of the respiratory centers; yet how respiratory rhythms originating from these centers, including their complexity, relate to demographic measures of prematurity remains largely unknown. In 39 neonates with mild RDS (22 males, 28 ± 2 wk gestational age, 1,036 ± 234 g body wt), we derived the univariate association between complexity of two respiratory rhythms [respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (VT)] and postmenstrual age, gestational age, postnatal age, and weight at time of study. RR and VT rhythm complexities were assessed using approximate entropy, sample entropy, base scale entropy, and forbidden words entropy estimated for 300 consecutive breaths determined from respiratory inductance plethysmography, irrespective of breathing effort rate or amplitude, collected during sleep while the neonates were exposed to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (4-6 cmH2O). RR and VT exhibited increased complexity with increased maturity, but only in terms of base scale entropy and forbidden words entropy, which are based on pattern matching, rather than approximate entropy and sample entropy, which are based on conditional probabilities. Specifically, RR complexity as measured by forbidden word entropy increased with increasing weight (r = 0.502), postconceptional age (r = 0.423), and gestational age (r = 0.493). As measured by base scale entropy, RR complexity increased with increasing weight (r = 0.488) and postconceptional age (r = 0.390). VT complexity, measured by base scale entropy, was greater with increased postnatal age (r = 0.428). Our results indicate that respiratory rhythms become more complex with increasing levels of maturity, as indicated by increased weight and several age parameters. This emphasizes the importance of the later weeks of gestation in the maturation of respiratory centers in the brain and suggests a promising use of entropy measures in exploring respiratory maturation in infants.

N2  - Possible prevention of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure has been investigated using peptides that were previously shown to be involved in neuroprotection both in vitro and in vivo. I focused in this study on investigating the neuroprotective effects of one of these peptides with regard to the determination of the downstream signaling pathways involved in neuroprotection. This peptide with the sequence NAPVSIPQ, known as NAP, a fragment of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, demonstrated a potent protective effect against oxidative stress associated with alcohol exposure. On embryonic day 7 (E7), weight-matched C57BL/6 pregnant females were assigned the following groups: (1) Ethanol liquid diet group (ALC) 25% (4.49%, v/v) ethano-derived calories, (2) Pair-fed (PF) control group (3) Chow control group, (4) treatment groups with alcohol alongside i.p. injections of d-NAP (ALC/d-NAP, 20 or 30 μg/20 g body weight), (5) PF/d-NAP control group. On E13, fetal brains were collected and assayed for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, caspase-3 colorimetric assay and ELISA for cytochrome c detection. My results show that NAP significantly prevented alcohol-induced weight reduction of the fetal brain. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL staining; NAP administration significantly prevented alcohol-induced increases in TUNEL-positive cells in primordium cingulate cortex and basal ganglia eminence. The investigation of downstream signaling pathways involving NAP neuroprotection revealed that this peptide significantly prevented alcohol-induced increase in the concentrations of caspase-3 in E13 fetal brains. Moreover, ELISA for cytochrome c shows that NAP significantly prevented both alcohol-induced increases in the level of cytosolic cytochrome c and alcohol-induced decreases in the level of mitochondrial cytochrome c. These data provide an understanding of NAP intracellular target, and the downstream mechanisms of action that will pave a path toward potential therapeutics against alcohol intoxication during prenatal stages. © 2009 IBRO.

N2  - The hypothesis that mothers who exercise during pregnancy have less time than non-exercisers for other activities was tested by having pregnant mothers complete a reliable and valid Modifiable Activity Questionnaire. Exercisers participated in moderate or vigorous aerobic exercise at least 30 minutes 3 times per week throughout the pregnancy whereas control mothers did not. Questions pertained to descriptives, daily activities, exercise, and amount of sleep. The data from 27 mothers with uncomplicated pregnancies (17 exercisers and 10 non-exercisers) have been analyzed. Mothers who exercised during pregnancy slept more each night than non-exercising moms. Although, all mothers were similar age, education levels, and height, there were significant differences between groups for weight and BMI. Control and exercising mothers with male fetuses were less active than moms with female fetuses and, had higher BMIs. Stay-at-home moms exercised less than those who worked out of the home, but stay-at-home control mothers were more active than control moms who workedoutside of the home. We unexpectedly found differences in BMI based on fetal gender. Additionally, exercising moms do not “steal” time to exercise. These results suggest exercising during pregnancy does not require “stealing” time, but being more time efficient. These data will hopefully encourage pregnant women to evaluate their use of time each day.

N2  - Objective: To investigate health and development in 6 and 18 months old children of mothers with epilepsy. Methods: In the population-based Norwegian Mother-and-Child Cohort Study, outcome at 6 and 18 months in 570 children of mothers with epilepsy (epilepsy group) were compared to 64,574 children (controls), as well as 406 children of fathers with epilepsy. Results: The epilepsy group constituted 0.9% of the cohort. In epilepsy-pregnancies, 75% (n=429) reported earlier antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment, whereas 27% (n=154) also reported AED-use during pregnancy. At 6 months, mothers in the epilepsy vs. control group reported more children with delayed motor development (3.0% vs. 1.7%, p=0.04, OR=1.8).At 18 months, the epilepsy group reported more delay in both motor development (6.2% vs. 3.7%, p=0.01, OR=1.7) and language (2.5% vs. 1.1%, p=0.02, OR=2.4), as well as emotional contact difficulties (0.6% vs. 0.1%, p=0.01, OR=5.2), sleep-disturbances (9.8% vs. 7.0%, p=0.04, OR=1.4), and referral to child-psychiatric services (2.2% vs. 1.0%, p=0.02, OR=2.3). Health problems related to congenital malformations were more frequent at both 6 months (3.6% vs. 1.6%, p< 0.001, OR=2.4) and 18 months (3.9% vs. 1.9%, p=0.006, OR=2.1). Abnormal head circumference was increased in the nonAED-exposed children of the epilepsy group (5.2% vs. 2.9%, p=0.03, OR=1.9). In children of fathers with epilepsy, congenital malformations, development, and other health problems were reported similar to controls. Conclusion: Mothers with epilepsy report more development delay in their 6 and 18 months old children, and more health problems due to congenital malformations. Paternal epilepsy is not associated with such outcomes.

N2  - Background: The decrease of maternal docosahexaenoic (DHA) status during pregnancy has been associated with postpartum depression, especially in women with a low intake of DHA. Since the DHA intake in the Netherlands is low, we investigated whether supplementation of low doses of DHA or DHA plus arachidonic acid (AA) during pregnancy and lactation could prevent depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances in this period. Methods: Women were supplemented daily with placebo, DHA (220 mg) or DHA + AA (220 mg each) from week 16 of pregnancy till three months postpartum. Fatty acid analyses were performed in the available plasma samples at 16 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Depressive symptoms were measured in weeks 16 and 36 of pregnancy and six weeks postpartum using EPDS and within one week postpartum using a blues questionnaire. Results: 119 women completed the study. The average frequency of fish intake was low, 0.94 times per week, and did not differ between the groups. The supplementation groups did not differ in mean EPDS scores or changes in EPDS scores, nor in incidence or severity of postpartum blues. Red blood cell DHA, AA and DHA/AA ratio did not correlate with EPDS or blues scores. Indices of sleep quality did not differ between the groups. Conclusion: Supplementation of 220 mg/day DHA or DHA + AA (220 mg/day each) does not prevent peri-partum depressive symptoms, in a population based sample with low background DHA intake.

N2  - Background: Myelomeningocele (MMC) is a relatively common birth defect (1-2/2000 live births), which originates from failure of the neural tube to close during the first month of gestation. The anatomical complex of MMC includes Chiari II malformation and hydrocephalus in most babies. Chiari II malformation is very common at birth unless foetal surgery has been performed. Chiari II may cause symptomatic pressure on the brainstem or on low cranial nerves, resulting in breathing and swallowing difficulties. Clinically, about 15-30% of MMC patients suffer from brainstem compression symptoms, and even if mild, they can cause mortality due to massive aspiration or apnoea. Goals: To study the correlation between the Chiari level (according to MRI) and the clinical symptoms of brainstem compression; Presence of a central breathing disorder (according to a sleep test); Association between level of spinal-defect and the degree of Chiari. Association between Chiari & hydrocephalus. Methods: 66 children with myelomeningocele operated during 1998-2007.A detailed database, MR images, clinical parameters and sleep test were included, and demonstrative cases are shown. Results: Clear correlation was seen between the Chiari level and brainstem compression, as was found association between severity of Chiari II and hydrocephalus. No correlation was found between the level of Chiari and the severity of central breathing disorder in sleep tests. The role of sleep test and its correlation to degree of Chiari is still unclear. Identification & treatment of patients at high risk to develop brainstem compression and hydrocephalus may avoid irreversible brainstem damage.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensorimotor disorder of the central nervous system. It is characterized by an irresistible urge or need to move the limbs that occurs as a result of uncomfortable limb sensations. Although RLS usually starts in the legs, it can spread to other parts of the body, such as the arms or torso. RLS sufferings often describe the disorder as feeling like water flowing inside the legs, "bugs in the bones," or electricity in the legs. These symptoms may be present all day, but usually worsen during periods, of inactivity and in the evening. People with RLS usually must move their limbs for complete or partial relief of the uncomfortable sensations. At night, RLS often is associated with periodic limb movements (PLMs), which can cause sleep problems and also make it difficult to perform sedimentary activities such as sitting comfortably in a car or on an airplane for extended periods. The cause of RLS remains unclear, but research suggests that impaired dopamine activity in the brain due to iron insufficiency may induce RLS in people with a genetic predisposition. RLS can be classified as primary or as secondary due to another medical condition, such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or pregnancy. Dopamine agonists like ropirinole and pramipexole are first-line therapy for RLS with daily smptoms. Alternative therapies are available for refractory cases or persistent symptoms. This article explores the prevalence, etiolog, and diagnosis of RLS as well as available treatments.

N2  - Aims: Prenatal exposure to alcohol can have adverse effects on the developing fetus. Two of the hallmarks of children exposed to alcohol prenatally are attention deficits and hyperactivity. While hyperactivity has been observed in rats following prenatal ethanol exposure, few studies have examined these effects in mice. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on activity in mice from three inbred strains: C57BL/6 (B6), Inbred Long Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short Sleep (ISS). Methods: On Days 7 through 18 of gestation, mice were intragastrically intubated twice daily with either 3.0 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin (MD); non-intubated control (NIC) litters were also generated. Offspring activity was monitored at 30, 60, 90 and 150 days of age. Results: While results showed no effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on any measures of activity, we did observe differences in baseline activity among the strains. ISS mice were more active than B6 and ILS for all activity measures except stereotypy; B6 mice had higher measures of stereotypy than ILS and ISS. Younger mice were more active than older mice. The only sex effects were on measures of stereotypy, where males had higher scores. Conclusions: Mice are an excellent organism to studygenetic influences on many phenotypes. However, our study and others have shown few effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on behavior in mice. It appears as if the prenatal period in mice, corresponding to organogenesis, is not a sensitive period for producing behavioral deficits following ethanol exposure. It is likely that the first 2 weeks postnatally, corresponding to the brain growth spurt, are more sensitive for producing behavioral effects. © The Author 2008.

N2  - Background and Purpose: Sleep quality seems to be an antecedent to depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We sought to 1) examine the psychometrics of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in pregnancy; 2) examine whether sleep quality predicted increases in depressive symptoms; and 3) compare PSQI scores across 3 or 2 levels of depressive symptoms. Methods: Each of the 252 participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (short form) and a sleep quality measure at mid and late pregnancy. Results: PSQI total scores showed good internal consistency and construct validity. An improved model of the internal structure of the PSQI in pregnancy was found with 1 factor labeled Sleep Efficiency, a second labeled Night and Daytime Disturbances, and an Overall Sleep Quality component associated with, but separate from, both of these 2 factors. Although PSQI scores showed moderate stability over time, sleep disturbance scores increased in late pregnancy. Importantly, PSQI prospectively predicted increases in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the PSQI is useful in pregnancy research. Findings also support the idea that sleep problems are prospective risk factors for increases in depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Practitioners are advised to screen for sleep quality during early pregnancy. © 2009 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.

N2  - Pregnant black depressed women were compared to pregnant black non-depressed women on self-report stress measures and cortisol levels at mid and late pregnancy and on neonatal outcomes. The depressed women had higher anxiety, anger, daily hassles, sleep disturbance scores and cortisol levels at both prenatal visits. These higher stress levels may have contributed to the greater incidence of prematurity and low birthweight neonatal outcomes noted in the depressed group, and they may partially explain the higher rate of prematurity and low birthweight among black women. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - With up to 80% of pregnant women experiencing nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), it is critical to have a graded scale of its severity as a guide for appropriate treatment. In 2002 we introduced the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) scoring system, which assessed the severity of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) based on three physical symptoms: nausea, vomiting, and retching over the previous 12 hours. We present here validation of an extension of the original PUQE, by assessing NVP over 24 hours. This extension is deemed more clinically relevant, because assessment of symptoms over only 12 hours may encompass sleeping hours and hence may not adequately capture the length and severity of the symptoms. In this study we assessed the external validity of the new PUQE-24 by examining its ability to evaluate several characteristics associated with NVP: (a) ability to take multivitamin supplements; (b) rates of hospitalization and emergency room visits for severe symptoms; (c) sleep patterns; (d) liquid intake; and (e) the woman's self-rated well-being scores. Data collected prospectively from 315 women counselled via the Motherisk NVP line were used for the validation. PUQE-24 showed strong correlation with all parameters examined except for sleep patterns and hydration status. The well-being score, however, correlated significantly with hydration status. Capturing 24 hours rather than 12 hours of symptoms may better direct management of NVP and predict its outcome.

N2  - Objective: The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence, duration and risk factors for benign neonatal sleep myoclonus (BNSM) in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) treated with opioids or sedatives, compared with control infants. Methods: This is a single centre observational case control study. Seventy-eight near term and term infants with neonatal opiate abstinence syndrome confirmed by meconium analysis were included. Exclusion criteria were cerebral malformation, intracranial haemorrhage and perinatal asphyxia. The babies were assessed eight hourly with a modified Finnegan score that included sleep myoclonus. Seventy-eight infants not exposed to opiates during pregnancy, hospitalized for at least 14 days and matched for gestational age were used as controls. Results: The median gestational age was 38 1/7 (95% CI: 35 3/7-41 2/7) weeks, birth weight 2730 (95% CI: 1890-3600) g, umbilical artery pH 7.25 (CI 7.10-7.37) and Apgar score at 5 minutes 9 (95% CI: 7-10). The control infants did not differ in these characteristics. Sleep myoclonus was diagnosed in 52 (67%) of the infants with NAS and 2 (2.6%) of the controls (OR 26 [95% CI: 7-223], p < 0.001). Myoclonus appeared as early as day 2 and as late as day 56 of life (median day 6) and lasted for 1 to 93 days (median 13 days). All infants had serum glucose > 2.5 mmol/L at first occurrence. The neurological examinations as well as cerebral ultrasound scans were normal. An electroencephalogram (EEG) carried out in 18 infants showed no signs of epileptic activity. Conclusion: BNSM has a high incidence in infants with NAS. The diagnosis can be made clinically. In the absence of other neurological symptoms further investigations such as EEG are not necessary and anticonvulsive treatment is not indicated. © 2008 The Author(s).

N2  - Affective illness is common in women, and the puerperium is a time of particular vulnerability. Gender differences in the expression of affective disorders have been attributed to the impact of hormonal influence, socialization, and genetics. Dramatic fluctuations in gonadal hormones that occur following childbirth, influences the increased incidence of mood disorders during this time. Numerous tools including the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale can be used to screen for depression during pregnancy and postpartum. While screening tools may assist with appropriately identifying women who should be further assessed, their use alone does not significantly increase treatment seeking in women, even when their providers are notified about risk. Many studies demonstrate that only a small number (18%) of women who meet criteria for major depressive disorder seek treatment during pregnancy and postpartum. Additionally, common symptoms of depression (sleep, energy and appetite change) may be misinterpreted as normative experiences ofpregnancy. Treatment engagement is important as untreated depression during pregnancy may have unfavorable outcomes for both women and children. Complications of pregnancy associated with depression include: inadequate weight gain, under utilization of prenatal care, increased substance use, and premature birth. Human studies demonstrate that perceived life-event stress, as well as depression and anxiety predicted lower birth weight, decreased Apgar scores, and smaller head circumference, and small for gestational age babies. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common clinical disorder occurring in 15% of deliveries, making it one of the most frequent conditions to complicate pregnancy. Risk factors include past personal or family history of depression, sing marital status, poor health functioning, lower SES, and alcohol use. Women who have a prior history of postpartum depression, particularly with features of bipolarity or psychosis may be at particularly high risk. © 2009 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common chronic condition characterized by a pattern of frequent, longlasting and difficult to control anxiety that is not focused on any one object or situation. Neurobiological hypothesis in GAD is an abnormal regulation of serotoninergic system. Trazodone, a serotonine antagonist/reuptake inhibitor, is an effective antidepressant drug with anxiolytic and hypnotic activity. Recent studies indicated that trazodone might due its anxiolytic action to a partial agonist effect at 5HTIA receptors. Objective:To assess the efficacy of trazodone in improving anxiety and benzodiazepine dependence severity. Methods: A group of 21 patients, 9 male and 12 female, 35- 60 years of age (mean age 45.7), diagnosed with GAD according to DSM IV-TR criteria and benzodiazepine dependence also according to DSM IV-TR criteria were evaluated for 6 months. All patient were evaluated using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-severity and improvement every week during the first month, then every month to endpoint. Inclusion criteria: male or female between 18 and 65 years of age meeting DSM IV-TR criteria for general anxiety disorder and benzodiazepine dependence, CGI-severity score ≥4, HAM-A score ≥25 with at least moderate symptoms of anxious mood, tension and poor sleep quality (a score ≥ 2 on items 1, 2 and 4). Exclusion criteria: personal history of Axis I disorders, other than generalized anxiety disorder, axis II comorbidity, somatic comorbidity, pregnancy or breast feeding. Each subject was gradually weaned from benzodiazepines over a 14 day period using a tapering dose schedule and received a progressive dose of trazodone (mean dose 225 mg/day) from the beginning of the weaning period. Benzodiazepine dependence was evaluated using the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) at baseline and 4 weeks from baseline. Benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms were evaluated using Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC). Results: Patients significantly improved during the first 4 weeks of treatment; HAM-A decreased with 53.8% after 4 weeks and the long term efficacy was also good, as HAM-A scores declined gradually throughout the study (≥73.6% decrease at the endpoint) paralleled by CGI improvements (-2.7 to baseline). Trazodone improved sleep (HAM-A item 4) from week 1; no evidence for rebound insomnia was found. Onset of anxiolytic effect was observed at week 2 (HAM-A item 1) and symptoms of anxiety improved further up to the endpoint. The tapering dose schedule for benzodiazepine weaning with progressive trazodone dosage showed minimal withdrawal symptoms, according to the Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC). All patients were benzodiazepine free according to SDS in week 4. Trazodone was well tolerated with no dropout subjects due to adverse events. Conclusion: Potential advantages of trazodone include its ability to treat both anxiety and insomnia, well known symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal, rapid positive effects on anxious mood, tension and sleeping disturbances improving compliance with treatment of GAD. The absence of potential for abuse and dependence and effectiveness in the management of benzodiazepine withdrawal indicates that trazodone is a useful therapy to help patients discontinue benzodiazepine.

N2  - Background. Obesity among children and adolescents is a growing public health problem. The aim of the present paper is to identify potential determinants of obesity and risk groups among 3- to 17-year old children and adolescents to provide a basis for effective prevention strategies. Methods. Data were collected in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), a nationally representative and comprehensive data set on health behaviour and health status of German children and adolescents. Body height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was classified according to IOTF cut-off points. Statistical analyses were conducted on 13,450 non-underweight children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years. The association between overweight, obesity and several potential determinants was analysed for this group as well as for three socio-economic status (SES) groups. A multiple logistic regression model with obesity as the dependent variable was also calculated. Results. The strongest association with obesity was observed for parental overweight and for low SES. Furthermore, a positive association with both overweight (including obesity) and obesity was seen for maternal smoking during pregnancy, high weight gain during pregnancy (only for mothers of normal weight), high birth weight, and high media consumption. In addition, high intakes of meat and sausages, total beverages, water and tea, total food and beverages, as well as energy-providing food and beverages were significantly associated with overweight as well as with obesity. Long sleep time was negatively associated with obesity among 3- to 10-year olds. Determinants of obesity occurred more often among children and adolescents with low SES. Conclusion. Parental overweight and a low SES are major potential determinants of obesity. Families with these characteristics should be focused on in obesity prevention. © 2009 Kleiser et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Summary: Polymicrogyria is a congenital brain malformation characterized by abnormal cortical lamination, excessive cortical folding (smaller and more numerous gyri). It is a consequence of brain perfusion failure during pregnancy between the 20th and the 24th weeks of gestation. Their classification (bilateral versus unilateral malformation) has been greatly improved by brain MRI, and their localizations are more frequently in the perisylvian regions. Sporadic polymicrogyria are predominant, but some familial syndromes have been identified. Mental retardation, pyramidal signs and epilepsy are frequently reported. Specific epileptic syndrome such as electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep can occur and require adapted antiepileptic drugs. When medical treatment is not adequate, surgical therapy has to be considered. We reported a study of 12 children with unilateral polymicrogyria associated with epileptic seizures and continuous spikes and waves syndrome - not controlled by steroïds - and treated successfully by hemispherotomy. All but one were seizure-free after surgery, antiepileptic drugs were stopped, without increase of the preoperative deficit, global motricity, behavior as well as learning capacities were moreover improved.

N2  - Dopa-responsive dystonia, also known as hereditary progressive dystonia with diurnal fluctuation or Segawa's syndrome, is a rare hereditary progressive dystonia with two striking clinical features: a marked diurnal fluctuation of symptoms with symptoms worsening throughout the day and improving after sleep, and a dramatic response to levodopa therapy. Whilst rare, it is treatable, with function being normal or near normal after levodopa therapy. We present our experience of providing anaesthesia for caesarean section in a patient with dopa-responsive dystonia and discuss the safety of levodopa therapy during pregnancy and the anaesthetic management of these patients. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Despite declines in prevalence during the last years, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) continues to be the leading cause of death for infants aged between 1 month and 1 year in developed countries. Epidemiological studies have described a number of environmental factors related, as placing infants prone for sleep, maternal smoking during pregnancy or postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke; however, the main cause of SIDS remains obscure. Since hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most prevalent causes of sudden cardiac death in younger adults, although in many cases the disease is not clearly evident at younger ages, we hypothesize about the possibility of founding HCM genes implicated in the development of sudden death in infants. In order to ascertain whether our hypothesis is correct, we have analysed more than 600 HCM mutations in 140 cases of SIDS. Mutation detection was performed with the MassArray genotyping platform of Sequenom and positive mutations were consequently confirmed by resequencing. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objective. We examined the impact of chronic stress on the relationship between second-trimester serum corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) concentrations and preterm delivery (PTD) in working women. Methods. Birth records from mothers of 364 PTD and 730 controls in Southern California were linked to stored mid-pregnancy maternal serum analysed for CRH. Association of CRH with stressors reported in post-partum interviews was examined in cases and controls separately. Stratified multivariable logistic regression analyses examined moderating influence of seven chronic stressors on CRH in predicting PTD. Results. Mean log CRH was lower among women with chronic stressors. Chronic stressors were not related to an increased risk of PTD, but did strengthen the association of CRH with PTD. Adjusted for confounders, the odds of PTD were 1.5-times higher per unit increase in log CRH in the overall study population, but were two-to-three times higher in subjects who reported unfulfilling jobs, little sleep or strong anger in the second trimester. Conclusion. The relation of CRH with PTD is moderated by exposure to chronic stressors during pregnancy. © 2008 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - In Wistar rats, pregnant or not pregnant, sleep-wakefulness parameters were registered for 2 days from 10:00 till 14:00. Later, these rats were subjected to 3-hour (11:00-14:00) daily sleep deprivation (SD) during 3 consecutive days. To prevent sleep, the following manipulations were used: acoustic stimulation from moving of the food pellets, opening or horizontal rotation of the cage and gentle handling. Control pregnant or not pregnant rats were placed in individual cages in the same room, but their sleep was not disturbed. On average, not pregnant rats spent about 65% of the time in sleep. Sleep episodes were mostly short (less than 1 min) or medium (1-15 min). After the beginning and with advance of pregnancy, the amount, deepness and duration of sleep episodes increased. With the methods of SD used, not pregnant rats did not sleep almost at all during the SD session. In pregnant rats, the quantity and intensity of stimuli used for SD increased as compared to control, which was indicatives of the growth of "sleep pressure" during pregnancy.

N2  - In the United States, about 1 million women of childbearing age have epilepsy. Estimates vary as to the percentage of these women who consider pregnancy, but epilepsy is the most common neurologic condition encountered in pregnancy. Women with epilepsy express significant interest in receiving guidance about pregnancy and the effects of seizures and anticonvulsant treatments on the developing fetus, but clinicians often are hard-pressed to find accurate and relevant information to share. In our practice, we devote many hours of clinical time to the counseling required when such a request is made. We begin by providing information about the risks of pregnancy for any woman, comparing the data for women with and without epilepsy; this gives patients perspective on the increase in the risk of fetal malformations associated with anticonvulsant therapy. We then proceed with an evaluation of whether the patient could consider withdrawing one or more anticonvulsants, particularly during the first trimester of gestation. For women who must continue taking anticonvulsants to prevent seizures, we explain that the increase in metabolism during pregnancy will require an increase in oral dosing to maintain prepregnancy concentrations of anticonvulsants. It is hoped that by maintaining prepregnancy blood levels during pregnancy, a woman with epilepsy can maintain the same level of seizure control during pregnancy that she had before conception. Additional time is spent discussing the need for adequate hydration, regular meals, and proper sleep during pregnancy and in the postpartum time to avoid behavioral alterations that can trigger seizures. As seizure medicines will need to be decreased after delivery, when a patient will be sleep-deprived and under the influence of hormonal changes that can increase the seizure tendency, our nurses meet with patients throughout pregnancy to develop plans for partner or family assistance with care of the neonate. Patients report appreciation for this type of personalized counseling but express frustration that we cannot provide absolute guidance with respect to the use of anticonvulsants in pregnancy. Therefore we often have to return several times to the topic of the limitations of scientific research regarding decision-making in pregnancy. Much of the information we have about the safety of anticonvulsant use in pregnancy comes from the registry studies discussed in this article. These studies can be difficult to interpret and compare because of the diversity of the methods used. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.

N2  - The purpose of this article is to examine whether multiple preterm birth poses a risk to the child's normal psychomotor development. The first part of the article presents the results of cognitive development in two sets of triplets born preterm (32 and 33 hbd). The second part compares the psychomotor development of 24 four-and five-year-old twin children born preterm to that of 24 preterm singletons matched for week of gestation at birth, sex and birth weight. The third part compares these results with those obtained in a study done by the third author of the present study in the 1970s of 56 children born from multiple pregnancies. An analysis of the data suggests that preterm birth accompanied by low or very low birth weight has a stronger effect on the psy-chomotor development of children than multiple pregnancy. The preterm triplets, examined in the first and second year of life, showed a smaller degree of cognitive development than full-term singletons, but their results did not differ from those that would be expected for the corrected birth age. No difference was found between 4-and 5-year-old preterm twins and preterm singletons, although both these groups obtained lower scores than their full-term peers. The mothers of preterm twins reported more behavioral problems. On the CBCL 1.5-5 scale, the twins had a higher general score for reported problems, especially internalization, emotional reactivity and sleep disturbances. There is a strong statistical tendency towards comple-mentary personalities among pairs of preterm twins due to the contrast effect.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that disturbances in levels of plasma melatonin differentiate pregnant and postpartum women with major depression from matched pregnant and postpartum healthy comparison women. Method: Participants were 25 pregnant women (10 with major depression, 15 healthy) and 24 postpartum women (13 with major depression, 11 healthy). Healthy comparison women were matched on the number of weeks pregnant or postpartum. Plasma melatonin levels for each subject were measured every 30 minutes, in dim light (<30 lux), from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m. The values of plasma melatonin levels were log-transformed, and calculations were determined for the following measures: baseline and synthesis onset and offset times, duration, peak concentration, and area under the curve. Groups were compared by analyses of covariance, with age, number of weeks pregnant or postpartum, breast-feeding status, and body mass index as covariates. Results: Morning melatonin levels from 2:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. were significantly lower in pregnant women with major depression relative to healthy pregnant women. However, these levels were significantly higher in postpartum women with major depression across time intervals relative to postpartum healthy women. Pregnant but not postpartum women with a personal or family history of depression, regardless of their current diagnosis, had significantly earlier melatonin synthesis and baseline offset times relative to women without a family history of depression. In pregnant healthy women but not pregnant women with major depression, melatonin levels increased during the course of pregnancy. This association was not found among postpartum women with major depression or postpartum healthy women. Conclusions: Plasma nocturnal melatonin concentrations, particularly during morning hours, were lower in depressed pregnant women but elevated in depressed postpartum women relative to matched healthy comparison women. In addition, melatonin timing measures were advanced in pregnant women with a personal or family history of depression. These findings implicate disturbances in the regulation of the melatonin generating system in pregnancy and postpartum depression.

N2  - Background: In utero exposure to smoking is known to adversely affect brain regions involved in behavioral state organization and could therefore interact with the neurophysiological development of neonates. Study Objectives: The present study investigated the effects of prenatal smoking exposure on sleep patterns in the preterm neonate. Design: Overnight sleep patterns were polysomnographically assessed at thermoneutrality. Sleep continuity and structure were scored for the respective frequencies, durations and percentages of active, quiet, and indeterminate sleep and wakefulness after sleep onset. The number and duration of body movements were also analyzed. Setting: The neonatal intensive care unit at Amiens University Medical Center (France). Participants: Healthy preterm neonates (postconceptional age: 33.9 ± 6.0 weeks) were enrolled according to whether their mothers had not smoked at all during pregnancy (control group, n = 19), smoked less during pregnancy (low-smoking group, Slow, n = 10), or smoked more (heavy-smoking group, S heavy, n = 10) than 10 cigarettes per day throughout pregnancy. Measurements and Results: Neonates born to heavy-smoking mothers had a significantly lower mean birth weight than controls (-21%) and displayed disrupted sleep structure and continuity: they slept less overall (with a higher proportion of active sleep and a lower proportion of quiet sleep) and had more wakefulness after sleep onset. Compared with controls, neonates from both smoking groups displayed more body movements and, as a result, more disturbed sleep. Conclusions: High prenatal smoking exposure modifies sleep patterns in preterm neonates by disrupting sleep organization and increasing nocturnal body movements. These findings raise the question of the repercussions of these sleep disturbances (at what is a critical stage in brain development) on the child's physiological and neurobehavioral outcomes.

N2  - The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of women of child-bearing age, and the diagnosis carries with it associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors that are likely linked to insulin resistance. Consequently, women affected by PCOS are at significant risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Aggressive screening for glucose intolerance and cardiovascular risk factors should be performed in all PCOS patients, and, when indicated by symptomatology, affected women should be screened for sleep apnea. Long-term goals of therapy should focus on prevention of these comorbidities.

N2  - Objective: To describe sleep characteristics in high-risk antepartum inpatients. Design: Prospective descriptive design. Setting: Tertiary hospital in southern California. Participants: A convenience sample of 39 antepartum women. Methods: Data were collected from participants' medical records, questionnaires (General Sleep Disturbance Scale), actigraphy on days 3 to 4 after admission, and a sleep diary that included reasons for awakening and morning and evening fatigue ratings. Results: Week gestation ranged from 24 to 35 weeks. Sleep time varied from 310 to 492 minutes and averaged 6.7 hours/night. The women were awakened 9 to 32 times/night and averaged 18 awakenings. They napped an average of 124 minutes throughout the day. Women averaged 3.9 on the General Sleep Disturbance Scale when retrospectively considering 7 days before hospitalization and scored 4.1 when considering the current 3 days of hospitalization. In the diary, most rated their sleep quality as Fairly Good or Very Good (62%-71%), but 29% said Very Bad on night 2, and 38% said Very Bad on night 3. Conclusion: Frequent interruptions during the night do not allow for mothers to receive the restorative sleep they need. © 2008 AWHONN.

N2  - Course and outcome of 200 pregnancies, deliveries and post-partum periods of 127 women with the onset of epilepsy before or during pregnancy were compared to clinical form of the disease, frequency of seizures and antiepileptic therapy. In addition, 104 children born to 97 mothers with epilepsy, 85 children--from the moment of birth to 1 year old and others from 1 to 16 years old, were studied. The particular attention was focused on the early neonatal adaptation. It was shown that, along with the last weeks of pregnancy, the first 7 days period after the delivery was critical for epilepsy severity. The development of seizures at this period was related to sleep deprivation and marked hormonal changes. There were no significant changes between the body mass of newborns of mothers with epilepsy and those of healthy mothers. The period of neonatal adaptation in children of affected mothers was favorable in 46% of cases. Some peculiarities of a child's state (withdrawal syndrome, hepatitis A etc.) were mostly related to the treatment of a mother with high dosages of antiepileptic preparations, i.e. valproic acid. These disturbances vanished to the age of 1-3 years. In summary, the active supervision of women by an epileptologist during the pregnancy period allows to optimize the prognosis of the child's health and better course of epilepsy in the mother.

N2  - Objective: To examine patterns of postpartum parental sleep and levels of fatigue at 2, 12, and 20 weeks following hospital discharge of newborn twins. Design: Descriptive longitudinal pilot study. Setting: Recruitment from 2 hospital postpartum units. Data collected in parents' homes. Participants: Eight primiparous parents caring for twins delivered at 33 to 38 weeks gestation. Methods: Home visits to deliver and retrieve study equipment: wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries to measure sleep, standardized instrument to measure fatigue, and an investigator-developed form to measure demographics and related variables. Results: Fathers had significantly less night sleep (5.4 hours) and less 24 hour sleep (5.8 hours) than mothers (6.2 and 6.9 hours, respectively) at 2 weeks after twins were discharged. Sleep efficiency increased significantly over time in a linear fashion for both parents. Morning and evening fatigue levels were not significantly different between parents and remained constant over time. Conclusion: Pilot data suggest that mothers and especially fathers of twins experience sleep disturbances after discharge of their twins. Further study is needed to more fully describe the evolution of sleep patterns and clarify factors that influence sleep in parents of twins. © 2008 AWHONN.

N2  - Despite a variable prevalence in the literature, OSAS is characterized by a higher frequency in men. This study involved a review of published data describing the impact of gender on features of OSAS.In women, OSAS seems to be associated with certain anatomical factors such as more significant obesity, a thinner oropharyngeal junction, a shorter uvula and reduced upper airway (UA) collapsibility, in comparison with men. Sleep related breathing disorders observed during pregnancy are more likely UA resistance syndrome than true OSAS, and are associated with severe fetal and maternal complications that could be improved by the use of nasal CPAP. Though OSAS symptoms are underestimated by women, the Epworth score as well as snoring are not influenced by gender. Gender does not seem to be a risk factor for increased mortality. Compliance with nasal CPAP is identical in both sexes, but oral appliance seem to be more effective in women.Further studies are needed to produce the required complementary data to confirm specific sex-related features in the diagnosis and treatment of OSAS. © 2008 SPLF.

N2  - Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a potentially fatal form of heart failure associated with pregnancy. A 29-year-old African American woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 36 weeks' gestation had a history of cardiomyopathy, morbid obesity (body mass index > 70 kg/m2), uncontrolled hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and required a repeat cesarean delivery. The patient was admitted to the hospital several times throughout her pregnancy for congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and headaches. Two years previously the patient received a diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy 3 weeks after the delivery of her second child. This case report illustrates the recognition of peripartum cardiomyopathy and the risks early in pregnancy. It also describes the appropriate medical management, including transesophageal echocardiography and the need for collaboration of multiple medical specialists before and during delivery to provide the best possible outcome for both mother and infant.

N2  - Empirical and clinical literature suggests a temporal thread running through family narratives of hereditary disease, linking past experiences to current beliefs about risk. This study asked young women with elevated risk of developing hereditary breast or ovarian cancer (HBOC) how their family histories with cancer and their gene status inform meaning construction around cancer risk and family development. Twenty-three women aged 22-35 who carry a BRCA gene alteration completed illness genograms and open-ended, narrative interviews. Transcripts were analyzed using the Listening Guide, a narrative tool that emphasizes key themes, meanings, and relational structures. Data analysis revealed distinct priorities for (1) single versus partnered women and (2) women who wished to have children versus those who had completed childbearing or were not intending to have children. Findings suggest single women experience increased urgency at finding a life partner capable of handling the emotional strain of the cancer world and open to pursuing multiple paths toward parenthood. Further, participants' family experiences shaped beliefs about perceived time to achieve desired family goals, specifically having biological children, before a cancer diagnosis or the need for preventive surgery. Clinical practice and research implications are discussed.

N2  - In a mature organism, the contact between various liquids and the laryngeal mucosa triggers lower airway protective responses (cough, swallowing, arousal). These laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) are essential for preventing aspiration. In contrast, previous studies showed that LCR are responsible for apnea and bradycardia in the neonatal mammal. Consequently, LCR, especially when triggered by acid gastrolaryngeal reflux, are deemed responsible for some apneas of prematurity and many life-threatening events of infancy and, probably, for some cases of sudden infant death syndrome. Recently, we have revisited LCR in full-term lambs during quiet sleep. Our results showed that the LCR triggered by HCl (pH 2), mimicking the acid component of an acid gastro-oesophageal reflux, were consistently like the mature LCR reported in adult mammals, without significant apneas and bradycardias (St-Hilaire 2005). These results prompted us to question whether premature birth alters LCR. Results show that LCR triggered in pre-term lambs by both saline and HCl are much more marked and clinically relevant than the ones observed in fullterm lambs. Indeed, life-threatening responses to HCl, including repetitive apneas for more than 90 seconds, severe desaturation and bradycardia, were observed in 2 lambs at postnatal day 7 (D7). In addition, LCR were significantly blunted at D14. In conclusion, HCl can trigger potentially dangerous LCR in pre-term lambs at D7, suggesting that LCR in response to acid gastrolaryngeal refluxes are likely involved in some apnea/bradycardia/desaturation in pre-term infants, before they reach a post-conceptional age equivalent to full gestation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Objective: To analyze whether previously identified risk factors for sudden death syndrome have a significant impact in a developing country. Methods: Retrospective longitudinal case-control study carried out in Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil. Cases (N=39) were infants born between 1996 and 2000 who died suddenly and unexpectedly at home during sleep and were diagnosed with sudden death syndrome. Controls (N=117) were infants matched by age and sex who died in hospitals due to other conditions. Data were collected from postmortem examination records and questionnaires answers. A conditional logistic model was used to identify factors associated with the outcome. Results: Mean age at death of cases was 3.2 months. The frequencies of infants regarding gestational age, breastfeeding and regular medical visits were similar in both groups. Sleeping position for most cases and controls was the lateral one. Supine sleeping position was found for few infants in both groups. Maternal variables, age below 20 years (OR=2, 95% CI: 1.1; 5.1) and smoking of more than 10 cigarettes per day during pregnancy (OR=3, 95% CI: 1.3; 6.4), significantly increased the risk for the syndrome. Socioeconomic characteristics were similar in both groups and did not affect risk. Conclusions: Infant-maternal and socioeconomic profiles of cases in a developing country closely resembled the profile described in the literature, and risk factors were similar as well. However, individual characteristics were identified as risks, in the population studied, such as smoking during pregnancy and maternal age below 20 years.

N2  - Fatigue, a common presenting symptom in primary care, negatively impacts work performance, family life, and social relationships. The differential diagnosis of fatigue includes lifestyle issues, physical conditions, mental disorders, and treatment side effects. Fatigue can be classified as secondary to other medical conditions, physiologic, or chronic. The history and physical examination should focus on identifying common secondary causes (e.g., medications, anemia, pregnancy) and life-threatening problems, such as cancer. Results of laboratory studies affect management in only 5 percent of patients, and if initial results are normal, repeat testing is generally not indicated. Treatment of all types of fatigue should include a structured plan for regular physical activity that consists of stretching and aerobic exercise, such as walking. Caffeine and modafinil may be useful for episodic situations requiring alertness. Short naps are proven performance enhancers. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline, may improve energy in patients with depression. Patients with chronic fatigue may respond to cognitive behavior therapy. Scheduling regular follow-up visits, rather than sporadic urgent appointments, is recommended for effective long-term management. Copyright © 2008 American Academy of Family Physicians.

N2  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is more common in pregnancies complicated by hypertensive disease and fetal growth restriction. Study design: An observational study comparing pregnant women with these two complications with normal pregnant women and non-pregnant women in two UK maternity hospitals. Each participant completed a sleep apnoea questionnaire and underwent nocturnal oxygen saturation monitoring. Results: Using a strict definition of obstructive sleep apnoea confirmed by oxygen saturation monitoring only two mild cases were seen, 0/50 non-pregnant women, 1/69 of normal pregnant women, 0/48 women with various types of hypertensive disease, and 1/33 women carrying fetuses affected with fetal growth restriction. Even using less strict definitions and self-reported sleepiness scores there was no relation between sleep apnoea and either fetal growth restriction or hypertensive diseases. Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnoea is at most a rare cause of either growth restriction or hypertensive disease in pregnancy. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: This study was conducted to clarify the prevalence of alcohol consumption among pregnant women in Japan and its associated factors. Method: 344 institutions participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2006. Each subject was requested to fill out a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy were examined using the chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis. Results: The number of effective responses was 18,965. The prevalence of alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy and during pregnancy was 44.6% and 4.6% respectively. The following items were recognized as being associated with promoting alcohol consumption during pregnancy: greater number of weeks of pregnancy, more pregnancies, fewer years of schooling, being employed, an alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, ignorance about the effects of alcohol consumption on fetuses, receiving advice regarding alcohol abstention, difficulty maintaining sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Conclusion: It is important to have a more comprehensive understanding of the factors associated with the alcohol consumption behavior of pregnant women, as revealed in the present study, in order to develop future policies for preventing alcohol consumption among pregnant women. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: To examine the effects of a community-based mutual health organization (MHO) on utilization of priority health services, financial protection of its members and inclusion of the poor and other target groups. Methods: Four MHOs were established in two districts in Mali. A case-control study was carried out in which household survey data were collected from 817 MHO member households, 787 non-member households in MHO catchment areas, and 676 control households in areas without MHOs. We compiled MHO register data by household for a 22-month period. Outcome measures included utilization of priority services, health expenditures and out-of-pocket payments. Independent variables included individual, household and community demographic, socioeconomic and access characteristics, as determined through a household survey in 2004. Findings: MHO members who were up to date on premium payments (controlling for education, distance to the nearest health facility and other factors) were 1.7 times more likely to get treated for fevers in modern facilities; three times more likely to take children with diarrhoea to a health facility and/or treat them with oral rehydration salts at home; twice as likely to make four or more prenatal visits; and twice as likely, if pregnant or younger than 5 years, to sleep under an insecticide-treated net (P < 0.10 or better in all cases). However, distance was also a significant negative predictor for the utilization of many services, particularly assisted deliveries. Household and individual enrolment in an MHO were not significantly associated with socioeconomic status (with the exception of the highest quintile), and MHOs seemed to provide some financial protection for their members. Conclusion: MHOs are one mechanism that countries strengthening the supply of primary care can use to increase financial access to - and equity in - priority health services.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In order to clarify the alcohol consumption status of pregnant women in Japan and the characteristics of pregnant women who abstained from alcohol after their pregnancy had been confirmed, a nationwide questionnaire-based study of alcohol consumption behavior was performed. We also examined the factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and abstention after the confirmation of pregnancy. METHODS: After random sampling, 260 institutions participated in the survey; these were selected from a list of survey points fixed by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The study was conducted on pregnant women with confirmed pregnancies by using self-administered anonymous questionnaires during the period from February 1 through 14, 2002. RESULTS: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was reported in 11.1% of the study participants, and abstention after the confirmation of pregnancy, in 76.9%. Significant associations were recognized between higher education and both alcohol consumption during pregnancy and abstention after pregnancy confirmation. Furthermore, alcohol consumption was significantly associated with parity, smoking, and shorter sleep duration, whereas abstention was significantly associated with less frequent alcohol consumption and knowledge regarding the risk of alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION: The results clarified the factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and abstention after the confirmation of pregnancy in Japan.

N2  - Background - Being born preterm, small, and to a mother who smokes are common perinatal complications with major public health implications. Evidence suggests that each affects the body's structure and function in ways that could increase susceptibility to cardiovascular dysfunction later in life. Here, we used 2 routine stress reactivity tests to identify incipient "silent" programming of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with adverse perinatal events. Methods and Results - We studied 29 control babies born at term to nonsmokers, 18 term-born babies of mothers who smoked throughout pregnancy (mean, 15 cigarettes a day), and 31 babies born preterm to nonsmokers. All infants were compared at the same age after conception (ie, at 40 to 42 weeks), during sleep. We analyzed blood pressure (BP) and heart rate responses to breathing 4% CO2 for 4 minutes or to passive head-up tilt to 60°. BP was measured continuously from a wrist cuff. CO2 exposure raised heart rate and BP in controls by 10%, and tilt increased their BP by 5%. CO 2 elicited the expected BP but no heart rate response from preterm infants but a much-greater-than-expected BP and heart rate response from babies of smokers. Tilt elicited a 3- to 4-fold greater rise in BP from preterm and tobacco-exposed babies. Conclusions - Vascular, cardiac, and blood pressure reactivity is heightened in babies born preterm or to smokers. The findings are consistent with in utero and early postnatal "programming" of human cardiovascular dysfunction by adverse circumstances. This incipient dysfunction may be an early manifestation of processes that lead to other problems or complications later on (eg, higher BP or sudden infant death syndrome). © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.

N2  - Choline supplementation of the maternal diet has long-term facilitative effects on spatial and temporal memory processes in the offspring. To further delineate the impact of early nutritional status on brain and behavior, we examined effects of prenatal-choline availability on hippocampal oscillatory frequency bands in 12 month-old male and female rats. Adult offspring of time-pregnant dams that were given a deficient level of choline (DEF = 0.0 g/kg), sufficient choline (CON = 1.1 g/kg) or supplemental choline (SUP = 3.5 g/kg) in their chow during embryonic days (ED) 12-17 were implanted with an electroencephalograph (EEG) electrode in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in combination with an electromyograph (EMG) electrode patch implanted in the nuchal muscle. Five consecutive 8-h recording sessions revealed differential patterns of EEG activity as a function of awake, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep states and prenatal choline status. The main finding was that SUP rats displayed increased power levels of gamma (30-100 Hz) band oscillations during all phases of the sleep/wake cycle. These findings are discussed within the context of a general review of neuronal oscillations (e.g., delta, theta, and gamma bands) and synchronization across multiple brain regions in relation to sleep-dependent memory consolidation in the hippocampus. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - • Most sleep complaints involve difficulties in getting to sleep or staying asleep, or not feeling refreshed on awakening. Misconceptions and worrying over the lack of sleep and its consequences can contribute to reinforcing these disorders. • How can patients who complain of poor-quality sleep be helped, without resorting to treatments that can have adverse effects? To answer this question, we conducted a systematic review of the literature based on the standard Prescrire procedure. • One effective approach is to explain the basic physiology of sleep, to discuss misconceptions, and to adopt a strategy of "stimulus control". This method has a similar efficacy to prescribing a benzodiazepine, and the effect is longer lasting. • Moderate, regular physical exercise, especially in the morning, seems to help some patients, but the evidence is weak. • Some clinical trials of phytotherapy have shown a positive risk-benefit balance of weak aqueous or hydroalcoholic valerian extracts. Efficacy is limited, however. • A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials showed that benzodiazepines and related drugs increase the duration of sleep and help patients to fall asleep sooner. However, none of these trials provides comparative data spanning periods of more than two weeks. Efficacy is uncertain in the longer term, as patients quickly develop a tolerance to the hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines. • The adverse effects of benzodiazepines include frequent memory disorders, daytime drowsiness, falls, fractures and road accidents, and a withdrawal syndrome after treatment cessation. Related drugs such as zolpidem and zopiclone provoke similar adverse effects. • Sedative antihistamines have not been as well-evaluated as benzodiazepines in this setting. Small comparative trials of doxylamine and diphenhydramine showed no major difference in efficacy versus benzodiazepines and related drugs. The main adverse effects of sedative antihistamines are daytime drowsiness and altered vigilance, and atropinic effects. • Case-control studies showed a statistical link between benzodiazepine use in early pregnancy and birth defects such as cleft lip. In contrast, data on the use of doxylamine during pregnancy are reassuring. • Other sedative psychotropics have not been adequately tested in this setting or have been shown to have a negative risk-benefit balance. • In practice, patients who complain of poor-quality sleep should be given appropriate information on the mechanisms of normal sleep and related misconceptions, on the best methods for getting to sleep, and on the dangers of sedative psychotropics (dependence, withdrawal syndrome). When prescribing or dispensing a benzodiazepine to a woman of child-bearing age, the risk of birth defects, although not clearly demonstrated, must be mentioned. © Review prepared and translated by the Prescrire Editorial Staff.

A cohort of children was followed longitudinally in a prospective study during the pregnancy and childhood (ELSPAC). In the age of 7 years, marked behavioural divergences were described in 4,4% of children by their attending physicians. These children were also more often afflicted by other pathological symptoms (hyperactivity, sleep and psychomotor disorders). From the data collected from parents and physicians in the previous phases of investigation we selected possible risk factors which affect the prenatal and postnatal periods: prenatal exposure of children to smoking, alcohol, chemical substances, prenatal development complications, the level of education of parents, family dysfunction, alcoholism of both parents, conflicts with the police, mother's disturbed mental health. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the sample of 3752 children from the city of Brno, no behavioural divergence was found in 96.5% of cases. The presence of one or two of the four observed divergences occurred in 3.2% and 3 to 4 conduct disorder symptoms occurred in 0.3% children, significantly more often in boys. The children with conduct disorders compared to the children with no symptoms had significantly lower average birthweight, lower head circumference, their mothers had more often lower education, smoked and had psychological problems in childhood and as adults and the fathers had more often conflicts with the law. CONCLUSIONS: The ELSPAC study did not have the methodological possibility of studying the genetic-environmental interactions; nevertheless it contributes to the evidence supporting that some factors can negatively effect the foetal development and the unfavourable family environment can participate in the development of conduct disorders which can progress during lifetime.

N2  - Chemical and enzymatic methods are used to measure creatinine in serum and urine. Chemical methods are mostly based on the reaction of creatinine with alkaline picrate (Jaffe reaction). The Jaffe reaction is not specific for creatinine, the same reaction resulting in Jaffe-like chromogens show many interfering substances (ascorbic acid, bilirubin, proteins, ketones, cephalosporins and other drugs). Chemical and enzymatic methods show similar accuracy and day-to-day precision. Chemical methods are cheaper than enzymatic methods. Enzymatic methods require low sample volume and are not affected by the interfering substances as the chemical methods. Presented case report shows an unusual occurrence of drug interference in the enzymatic creatine deaminase procedure. Biological factors (circadian rhythm, pregnancy, hemodialysis, transplantation, stress, exercise), analytical and preanalytical factors (pH, glucose, pyruvate, bilirubin, fatty acids, sample storage and sample collection - gel tubes) and biological variability of creatinine play significant role in the creatinine examination.

N2  - Background: Pregnant women's sleep disturbance due to fetal movement is well known. Fetal movement is thought to be an index of fetal well-being. However, as there has never been a way to easily and reliably record fetal movement, psychophysiological studies of pregnant women's sleep disturbance and fetal well-being have not been done. Aims: To solve these methodological issues, we developed a new sensor with electrostatic capacity that can pick up acceleration of fetal movement. Methods and results: Experiment I: We verified the reliability of our fetal movement recording system. Thirty-two pregnant women (from 19 to 39 weeks of gestation) were asked to lie down on a bed for about 1 h and to press a button as a subjective marker when they felt fetal movement. We simultaneously recorded maternal polysomnograms and fetal movement from the mothers' abdomens using a Medilog recorder. The mean of prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa for agreements, based on time between fetal movement signals recorded and subjective maternal markers, was substantial at 0.75. Experiment II: We recorded seven pregnant women's polysomnograms and fetal movement simultaneously during all-night sleep at home using our sensor during weeks 33 and 36 of gestation. We succeeded in recording maternal micro-arousals evoked by fetal movement. The mean value of the number of micro-arousals at 33 weeks was slightly larger than that at 36 weeks. Conclusions: There was a high agreement between subjective maternal markers and fetal movement. Our recording system using the new sensor can be used for home monitoring of fetal movement. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Infants exposed prenatally to alcohol are at increased risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Aim: To examine the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure, sleep, arousal and sleep-related spontaneous motor movements in early infancy. Study design: Low-income women (N = 13) were interviewed regarding pre- and pregnancy rates of alcohol, cigarette smoking and other substance use in the perinatal period. Infants were examined in a laboratory nap study using EEG, videography and actigraphy at 6-8 weeks of age. Estimates of maternal pre- and pregnancy alcohol use were used to divide infants into high vs. low maternal alcohol use groups. Subjects: Mother-infant dyads recruited from a family practice clinic. Outcome measures: Sleep-related spontaneous movements, behavioral state, and maternal assessments of infant alertness and irritability. Results: Pre-pregnancy rates of alcohol consumption including binge drinking correlated with maternal report of poor infant alertness, and increased irritability. High maternal exposure groups showed increased sleep fragmentation, e.g. frequency and duration of wakefulness following sleep onset and decreased active sleep. Bout analysis of the temporal structure of sleep-related spontaneous movements showed significantly reduced bout duration associated with high maternal alcohol use. Conclusion: These results present evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts postnatal sleep organization and suppresses spontaneous movements during sleep, and increased sleep fragmentation promotes sleep deprivation. Results are consistent with the SIDS model of chronic sleep debt and suggest that attenuated sleep-related movements should be examined as an important modulator of cardiorespiratory functions during sleep in high-risk groups. © 2008.

N2  - A woman's sleep is impacted by biology (menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause), sleep disorders (that may manifest differently than in men), and role in the home and workplace. A Women and Sleep Workshop, sponsored by the National Sleep Foundation, in March 2007 reviewed these topics. It was concluded that understanding the relationship between sleep and gender will result in a scientifically based approach to women's sleep problems. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Sleep disorders affect women differently than they affect men and may have different manifestations and prevalences. With regard to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), variations in symptoms may cause misdiagnoses and delay of appropriate treatment. The prevalence of OSA appears to increase markedly after the time of menopause. Although OSA as defined by the numbers of apneas/hypopneas may be less severe in women, its consequences are similar and perhaps worse. Therapeutic issues related to gender should be factored into the management of OSA. The prevalence of insomnia is significantly greater in women than in men throughout most of the life span. The ratio of insomnia in women to men is approximately 1.4:1.0, but the difference is minimal before puberty and increases steadily with age. Although much of the higher prevalence of insomnia in women may be attributable to the hormonal or psychological changes associated with major life transitions, some of the gender differences may result from the higher prevalence of depression and pain in women. Insomnia's negative impact on quality of life is important to address in women, given the high relative prevalence of insomnia as well as the comorbid disorders in this population. Gender differences in etiology and symptom manifestation in narcolepsy remain understudied in humans. There is little available scientific information to evaluate the clinical significance and specific consequences of the diagnosis of narcolepsy in women. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an urge to move the legs or other limbs during periods of rest or inactivity and may affect as much as 10% of the population. This condition is more likely to afflict women than men, and its risk is increased by pregnancy. Although RLS is associated with impaired quality of life, highly effective treatment is available. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: Black infants die from sudden infant death syndrome at twice the incidence observed among non-Hispanic white infants. Explanations for this disparity include a two-fold greater prevalence of prone (i.e., stomach) infant sleep placement among black caregivers. I test the hypothesis that the contraction of state economies may contribute to this disparity by increasing the risk of prone infant sleep placement among black mothers. Methods: I retrieved data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment series and 33,518 black mothers in 26 states participating in the 1996-2002 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. I use weighted multivariable analyses to control for individual characteristics and state and time trends. Results: Black mothers exhibit an elevated risk of reporting prone placement one month following statewide declines in employment (adjusted odds ratio for a one percent decline = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22). This risk remains elevated after control for individual variables. In contrast, I find no association between the economy and prone placement among white mothers. Conclusions: Statewide economic decline may reduce adherence to the recommended non-prone infant sleep position among black, but not white, mothers. Additional research among black caregivers should determine which mechanisms connect economic downturns to prone infant sleep placement. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Prevalence of asthma in developed countries increased between the 1970s and the 1990s. One factor that might contribute to the trends in asthma is the increased use of acetaminophen vs aspirin in children and pregnant women. Objective: To examine relationships between in utero exposure to acetaminophen and incidence of respiratory symptoms in the first year of life. Methods: A total of 345 women were recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy and followed up with their children through the first year of life. Use of acetaminophen in pregnancy was determined by questionnaire and related to incidence of respiratory symptoms. Results: Use of acetaminophen in middle to late but not early pregnancy was significantly related to wheezing (odd ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.0) and to wheezing that disturbed sleep (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.8) in the first year of life after control for potential confounders. Conclusion: This study suggests that use of acetaminophen in middle to late but not early pregnancy may be related to respiratory symptoms in the first year of life. Additional follow-up will examine relationships of maternal and early childhood use of acetaminophen with incidence of asthma at ages 3 to 5 years, when asthma diagnosis is more firmly established.

N2  - Rarely in the history of medicine has an X-linked mental retardation syndrome so thoroughly entered every branch of medicine, at least of pediatrics, but also of internal medicine, on account of its protean manifestations. In such countries as Zambia, malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, and other infections diseases, and many environmental and nutritional disorders still top the list of childhood morbidity and mortality. However, in the more developed nations of the Old and New Worlds, prematurity, birth defects, and genetic conditions constitute the major burden of infant mortality and chronic childhood handicaps. One of the most pervasive of these is the group of FG syndromes seen in every pediatric clinic and mental health service. A partial list includes:Peri- and neonatology: prematurity, breech and cesarean section delivery, intrauterine growth retardation, congenital hypotonia, difficulties in neonatal adaptation, feeding difficulties, reflux with or without aspiration, failure to thrive, single umbilical artery, infant deathOtology/otorhinolaryngology: severe congenital sensorineural deafness; chronic recurrent otitis; sinusitis and tonsillitis (tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy), stridor/laryngomalacia; grade 1 laryngeal cleft with or without subglottic stenosis; cleft palate; rare choanal stenosis; almost universal narrowing of ear canals with frequent need to remove wax; short lingual frenulum, labiogingival frenulum; conductive hearing lossOphthalmology: strabismus, congenital nystagmus; large corneae; stenosis of nasolacrymal ducts; lack of tearing; ptosis; blepharophimosis with inturned eyelashes and corneal irritation; errors of refraction, cobolomataAllergy: almost universal reactive airway disease; sometimes eczema, generally rather mildPulmonology: aspiration pneumonia, atelectasis; sleep apneas and other sleep disturbances that may require continuous positive airway pressure.Gastroenterology: reflux (Nissen), feeding difficulties and failure to thrive (G-button), constipation, diarrhea, pyloric stenosis, and rectal stenosisUrology [61]: hypospadias, inguinal hernia(e), cryptorchidism, hydrocele, renal anomalies, neurogenic bladder, nephrolithiasisCardiology: patent ductus arteriosus, patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, (peripheral) pulmonic stenosis, left superior vena cava, conduction defects, autonomic vascular problems, postnatal hypotension, acrocyanosis/RaynaudGeneral surgery: umbilical hernia, rare diaphragmatic herniaNeurosurgery: Chiari I (beyond 10 mm [62]), syringomyelia, tethered cord, cervical vertebral malformations, rarely true hydrocephalusRadiology: for "everything," brain MRI and cine-MRI of lower cord recommended in all FGS children, boys and girlsOrthopedics: ectrodactyly, polysyndactyly, duplication of thumb, congenital clubfeet, syndactyly, patellar subluxation, hypotonic scoliosis, hypotonic pectus excavatum, unstable hipsPlastic surgery: helmet for congenital plagiocephaly/torticollis; occasional hemangiomataDermatology: pigmentary dysplasias, nevi, warts, melanoma surveillancePhysical therapy: hypotonia, hypotonic diplegia, motor delayOccupational therapy: defects of sensory integration (especially oral tactile aversion), feeding therapy, autistic manifestations.Speech therapy: virtually universal speech delayPsychology: evaluation of behavior, autism, cognitive/psychomotor development; psychologic therapyPsychiatry: evaluation for "autism," behavior and emotional problems (ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder; bipolar disorder), psychopharmacology, psychotherapyHematology: follow-up of those with neonatal anemia, neutropenia/leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and other platelet disordersInfectious disease and rheumatology: immune deficiencies toward potential intravenous immunoglobulin treatment [63], recurrent viral infections, respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus, bronchiolitis.Pediatric genetics: cytogenetics, molecular genetics, FGS carrier testing, genetic counselingObstetrics and gynecology: Pregnancies in known FGS carriers require most careful surveillance and such women must be considered at high risk after a prior complicated outcome. In the process, the carrier woman may be discovered to have a uterine malformation (uterus bicornis, septate, duplex) and an unusually short perineal body. There is a much higher probability of cesarean delivery for hypotonia, cephalic dystocia, fetal distress, breech or transverse presentation, failure to progress, and other reasons. Soon molecular prenatal diagnosis will be possible.Pathology: At autopsy a stillborn male infant or fetus with evident congenital hypotonia, hypertelorism, hypospadias, broad thumbs, and halluces. Parents are not present to give a family history and the case may end up being coded "multiple congenital anomalies, chromosomes (apparently) normal," with no further causal analysis. In the fetal genetic pathology service at the University of Utah, we have begun to add the sentence: "Consider possibility of FG syndrome and referral to genetics." This takes into account the frequent note of fetal or infant death in FGS sibships evaluated in the pediatric genetics, and the findings in the last three syndromal infant cases referred by the Utah medical examiner, one dying of overwhelming sepsis with dehydration, failure to thrive, and severe constipation after formula change to Neocate with over 100 rock-hard sciboli in colon, and several affected sibs with FGS. Another male died suddenly 1 day after cochlear implant with pronounced congenital hypotonia and megalencephaly. Another was a "sudden infant death" in a male with congenital hypotonia, large head, and urethral megameatus. Thus, in our experience FGS emerges as the most common yet the least known developmental disabilities condition in our society. FGS imposes a tremendous burden of morbidity, and to some extent also of mortality, on society and families. After successful neonatal adaptation, such recurring problems as otitis, reactive airway disease, and constipation can be routinely treated symptomatically. However, the neurodevelopmental burden represents the greatest challenge that FGS presents for families and to society. Under the best of circumstances, motor and speech development catch up. However, virtually all FGS children, boys and girls, have difficulties in psychologic development, school performance, and ultimate emotional adaptation to adult life and social integration. The many such cases added to those with outright psychiatric disturbances are overwhelming social, psychologic, and psychiatric services and, above all, public and private school systems, which are understaffed, underfunded, beyond formulating individual educational plans, and helpless to deal with the enormous burden of special service needs of these children. It's time that handicapped children receive care according to needs and not according to diagnosis. However, the near absence of information on FGS available to these professionals is a handicap in arriving at a specific diagnosis (allowing state and federal support for special services) and in understanding the prognosis, natural history, and such complications as "autism," seizures, and tethered cord that affect the child's success at home, in school, and out in society. The FGS parent support group has been of enormous help in informing families about all of these "issues," and to this day remains the greatest repository of knowledge on FGS. As they say in baseball, it is time at long last for the professionals "to step up to the plate.". © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Gestational diabetes mellitus can be controlled and its complications prevented, provided clients take part in self-care actions. The objective of the present study was to identify self care deficiencies in pregnant women suffering from diabetes, and to provide inputs for their educational support. This descriptive study included 12 pregnant women cared at a diabetes and hypertension reference institution in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil, in April and May, 2007. Data were collected using a semistructured interview. Analysis was based on Orem's Nursing General Theory. Self-care deficiencies were related to eating habits, physical activities, sleep and rest, and social interaction. Nurses must provide educational support to these patients, evaluate their self-care capacity, and propose actions that involve the family, as well as group activities in health services.

N2  - While the treatment of bipolar disorder (BD) is typically complex, the treatment of women with bipolar disorder is even more challenging because clinicians must also individualize treatment based on the potential for pregnancy, drug interactions with oral contraceptives, and an increased risk of endocrine diseases that can either impact the course of illness or become manifest with some treatments. Women with BD should be checked for hypothyroidism, and if prescribed antidepressants, carefully watched for rapid cycling or a mood switch to mania, hypomania, or a mixed state. Several medications interact with oral contraceptives or increase the risk of developing polycystic ovary syndrome. Consideration of possible pregnancy is essential, and should be planned in advance whenever possible. Rates of recurrence have been shown to be equal in pregnant and nonpregnant women with BD. Risks of medication to the fetus at various points of development must be balanced against the risks of not treating, which is also detrimental to both fetus and mother. The postpartum period is a time of especially high risk; as many as 40% to 67% of women with BD report experiencing a postpartum mania or depression. The decision to breastfeed must also take into account the adverse impact of sleep deprivation in triggering mood episodes. In order to best address these issues, clinicians must be familiar with the data and collaborate with the patient to assess risks and benefits for the individual women and her family. © 2008, LLS SAS.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate pregnancy-associated sleep disorders, pregnancy outcomes and inflammatory markers in pre-eclampsia and normal pregnancy (control). Patients and methods: We studied 15 consecutive pre-eclamptic women and 14 controls. Pre-eclamptic women underwent overnight pulse oximetry and nasal pressure measurements at a university teaching hospital, and the sleep study for the controls was performed at home. Mean gestation was 31 weeks. Nasal airflow was carefully analyzed visually, and the time with flow limitation was calculated as a percentage of total recording time. At the time of the sleep study, the subjects were clinically evaluated, they answered sleep questionnaires, and fasting blood samples were drawn for tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-α, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and sensitive C-reactive protein. Pregnancy outcomes were collected after delivery. Results: Pre-eclampsia patients spent significantly more time with flow limitation (mean ± SD: 21 ± 18% vs. 4 ± 9%), had higher plasma levels of TNF-α (6.2 ± 2.3 ng/l vs. 4.1 ± ng/l) and IL-6 (4.4 ± ng/l vs. 1.2 ± 0.4 ng/l), had more generalized edema, had increased fatigue and snoring, and had poorer pregnancy outcomes than did controls. Age, gestational age, mean SpO2 and body mass index did not differ between the groups. Conclusions: Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia showed significantly more nasal flow limitation during the night, higher fasting IL-6 and TNF-α plasma levels, more edema and worse pregnancy outcomes than did healthy pregnant women. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Concerns regarding potential harmful effect of medications on fetuses often result in inadequate treatment of asthma in pregnancy, whereas risks posed by poorly controlled maternal asthma are often underestimated. Objective: To evaluate the effect of maternal asthma on preterm delivery and fetal growth. Methods: Study participants were individuals enrolled in the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists Asthma Medications in Pregnancy Study between February 1, 1998, and December 31, 2003. Pregnant women with physician-diagnosed asthma (n = 719) evaluated their asthma control repeatedly during pregnancy based on symptom frequency and interference with daily activities and sleep and reported hospitalizations and unscheduled clinic visits for asthma exacerbations. The incidence of preterm delivery, the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction, and mean birth weight were evaluated relative to asthma symptom control and exacerbation measures. Results: The incidence of preterm delivery was significantly higher among patients with inadequate asthma symptom control during the first part of pregnancy (11.4%) compared with patients with adequate asthma control (6.3%; P = .02). Similarly, patients who were hospitalized for asthma during pregnancy had a higher incidence of preterm delivery (16.4%) compared with asthmatic women without a history of hospitalization (7.6%; P = .02). The effect seemed independent from use of systemic corticosteroids and other covariates. Neither the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction nor mean birth weight varied by any measures of asthma symptom control or exacerbations. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a substantial risk for preterm delivery posed by poorly controlled maternal asthma and provides additional evidence regarding the importance of adequate treatment of asthma in pregnancy to maintain optimal asthma control.

N2  - Sophia is a 3-year-old girl who was brought to her pediatrician by her parents who were concerned about inconsolable night-time awakening. Her mother indicated that she has frequent (>6), early nocturnal awakenings accompanied by screaming and crying lasting up to 1 hour since her birth. These episodes increased in intensity and frequency in the past year since the birth of her brother. With a bedtime routine (a cup of water by bedside with a washcloth and touching mother's nose, chin, and cheeks), Sophia falls asleep easily; however, within 1 hour she awakes screaming and flailing unaware of her surroundings and unable to be comforted. There are no tonic-clonic movements. Prior interventions, including a sleep coach and "letting Sophia cry it out," did not change her sleep pattern. Sophia's mother reports that she needs to be on a specific daily routine including set times for awakening, activity, snacks, naps, and meals. Diversion from the routine and separation from her mother results in a tantrum (kicking, hitting, screaming, and inconsolability) often lasting more than 30 minutes. Sophia was born after an uncomplicated 37-week gestation. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia required readmission for 24 hours of phototherapy; serum bilirubin levels were performed daily for 3 weeks after discharge. At 6 weeks, daily episodes of screaming, inconsolability, forceful vomiting, and inability to sleep led to a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. Medication trials were not successful, but the symptoms resolved by 5 months. Formula intolerance and difficulty swallowing and chewing different textures of solid food occurred in the first year. Occupational therapy was of "no benefit"; Sophia was overwhelmed by the activity and took a long time to warm up to the therapist. Her texture aversion resolved by 2 years of age. She prefers one-on-one play and has minimal interactions with other children. She has met all her developmental milestones appropriately and has no other health issues. Sophia lives with her parents and infant brother. There is a maternal family history of insomnia and sleep walking and a paternal history of sleep walking. Her mother adheres to a strict daily schedule. Sleep deprivation, different parental child-rearing practices, social isolation, and lack of quality parent time were all identified by the mother as significant marital stressors. During the office visit, Sophia required 30 minutes to warm up and smile, and over 60 minutes before she spoke her first word. Physical examination was normal (including growth measurements) and the developmental examination was age-appropriate. Upon completion of the assessment, she was engaging, playful, and cooperative with the pediatrician. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The supine (back) sleep position has been found to be an important factor in the reduction of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). This paper will examine infant sleep position in Oklahoma and offer recommendations to increase safe sleep practices for Oklahoma infants. METHODS: Oklahoma Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data were used to estimate prevalence of sleep position among demographic maternal groups and related health behaviors. Chi-square tests were used to determine significance at p< 0.05. Logistic regression modeling was used to produce adjusted odds ratios to measure the association of selected independent variables and sleep position. RESULTS: Fifty-six percent of Oklahoma newborns were placed on their backs to sleep most of the time, far short of the Healthy People 2010 goal of 70%. Almost 1 in 5 infants were placed on their stomachs to sleep, a known risk factor for SIDS. Women between 100-184% of the federal poverty level, African American women and mothers with more than one child were those least likely to place their infants on their backs to sleep. CONCLUSION: Overall, the issue of not utilizing the recommended safe sleep position, the supine position, is pervasive among all maternal groups in Oklahoma. Significant differences were present for only a few variables (race, income, parity) indicating a strong need for a consistent message on sleep position for all Oklahoma parents and grandparents.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal alcohol exposure via maternal liquid diet consumption by C57BL/6 (B6) mice causes conspicuous midline neural tube deficit (dysraphia) and disruption of genesis and development of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the raphe nuclei, together with brain growth retardation. The current study tested the hypothesis that concurrent treatment with either an activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) agonist peptide [SALLRSIPA, (SAL)] or an activity-dependent neurotrophic protein (ADNP) agonist peptide [NAPVSIPQ, (NAP)] would protect against these alcohol-induced deficits in brain development. Methods: Timed-pregnant B6 dams consumed alcohol from embryonic day 7 (E7, before the onset of neurulation) until E15. Fetuses were obtained on E15 and brain sections processed for 5-HT immunocytochemistry, for evaluation of morphologic development of the brainstem raphe and its 5-HT neurons. Additional groups were treated either with SAL or NAP daily from E7 to E15 to assess the potential protective effects of these peptides. Measures of incomplete occlusion of the ventral canal and the frequency and extent of the openings in the rhombencephalon were obtained to assess fetal dysraphia. Counts of 5-HT-immunostained neurons were also obtained in the rostral and caudal raphe. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in abnormal openings along the midline and delayed closure of ventral canal in the brainstem. This dysraphia was associated with reductions in the number of 5-HT neurons both in the rostral raphe nuclei (that gives rise to ascending 5-HT projections) and in the caudal raphe (that gives rise to the descending 5-HT projections). Concurrent treatment of the alcohol-consuming dams with SAL prevented dysraphia and protected against the alcohol-induced reductions in 5-HT neurons in both the rostral and caudal raphe. NAP was less effective in protecting against dysraphia and did not protect against 5-HT loss in the rostral raphe, but did protect against loss in the caudal raphe. Conclusions: These findings further support the potential usefulness of these peptides for therapeutic interventions in pregnancies at risk for alcohol-induced developmental deficits. Notably, the ascending 5-HT projections of the rostral raphe have profound effects in regulating forebrain development and function, and the descending 5-HT projections of the caudal raphe are critical for regulating respiration. Protection of the rostral 5-HT-system may help prevent structural and functional deficits linked to abnormal forebrain development, and protection of the caudal systems may also reduce the increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Objective: To identify factors predictive of either lateral or prone infant sleep positioning. Study design: We used data for 11 340 mother-infant pairs from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for infants born in Washington State, 1996 to 2002. We used predictive modeling to identify statistically significant (P < .05) predictors of lateral and prone sleep positioning. Results: Factors associated with both high-risk sleep positions included infant's year of birth, maternal race and ethnicity, maternal county of residence, and maternal parity. Mother's being US-born (versus foreign-born) and male infant sex were predictive only of prone sleep positioning. Having Medicaid as primary insurance, receipt of government benefits, low infant gestational age, and low birth weight were predictive only of lateral sleep positioning. Conclusions: Factors predictive of either high-risk sleep position should be considered when devising public health intervention strategies for the prevention of SIDS. © 2008 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - Restless-legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder, characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations. It begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, is partially or totally relieved by movements and is exacerbated or occurs at night and in the evening. RLS sufferers represent 2 to 3% of the general population in Western countries. Supportive criteria include a family history, the presence of periodic-leg movements (PLM) when awake or asleep and a positive response to dopaminergic treatment. The RLS phenotypes include an early onset form, usually idiopathic with a familial history and a late onset form, usually secondary to peripheral neuropathy. Recently, an atypical RLS phenotype without PLM and l-DOPA resistant has been characterized. RLS can occur in childhood and should be distinguished from attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, growing pains and sleep complaints in childhood. RLS should be included in the diagnosis of all patients consulting for sleep complaints or discomfort in the lower limbs. It should be differentiated from akathisia, that is, an urge to move the whole body without uncomfortable sensations. Polysomnographic studies and the suggested immobilization test can detect PLM. Furthermore, an l-DOPA challenge has recently been validated to support the diagnosis of RLS. RLS may cause severe-sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, depressive and anxious symptoms and may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In most cases, RLS is idiopathic. It may also be secondary to iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, peripheral neuropathy and drugs, such as antipsychotics and antidepressants. The small-fiber neuropathy can mimic RLS or even trigger it. RLS is associated with many neurological and sleep disorders including Parkinson's disease, but does not predispose to these diseases. The pathophysiology of RLS includes an altered brain-iron metabolism, a dopaminergic dysfunction, a probable role of pain control systems and a genetic susceptibility with nine loci and three polymorphisms in genes serving developmental functions. RLS treatment begins with the elimination of triggering factors and iron supplementation when deficient. Mild or intermittent RLS is usually treated with low doses of l-DOPA or codeine; the first-line treatment for moderate to severe RLS is dopaminergic agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). In severe, refractory or neuropathy-associated RLS, antiepileptic (gabapentin, pregabalin) or opioid (oxycodone, tramadol) drugs can be used. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: It is widely accepted that circadian physiological rhythms of the fetus are affected by oscillators in the maternal brain that are coupled to the environmental light-dark (LD) cycle. Methodology/Prindpal Findings: To study the link between fetal and maternal biological clocks, we investigated the effects of cycles of maternal food availability on the rhythms of Per1 gene expression in the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver using a transgenic rat model whose tissues express luciferase in vitro. Although the maternal 5CN remained phase-locked to the LD cycle, maternal restricted feeding phase-advanced the fetal SCN and liver by 5 and 7 hours respectively within the 22-day pregnancy. Conclusions:/Significant: Our results demonstrate that maternal feeding entrains the fetal SCN and liver independently of both the maternal SCN and the LD cycle. This indicates that maternal-feeding signals can be more influential for the fetal SCN and particular organ oscillators than hormonal signals controlled by the maternal SCN, suggesting the importance of a regular maternal feeding schedule for appropriate fetal molecular clockwork during pregnancy. © 2008 Ohta et al.

N2  - The practice of shift-work scheduling has long been part of normal work duties in emergency services such as health and security. It is only recently, in the wake of growing job opportunities and booming industries, where more employees are needed to keep services running over 24-hour periods that studies on the effects of shift work on workers' health have begun to delve deeper. The desynchronisation that occurs in circadian rhythms, with respect to sleep cycles, predisposes employees to coronary heart disease, gastrointestinal disturbances, increased risk of breast cancer and poor pregnancy outcomes. This literature review focuses on circadian rhythms, their molecular components, disturbances of these rhythms as a result of shift work and the adverse effects thereof on the cardiovascular system.

N2  - Several modifiable pre- and postnatal determinants of childhood overweight are known, but no one has examined how they influence risk of overweight in combination. We estimated the risk of overweight at age 3 years according to levels of maternal smoking during pregnancy, gestational weight gain, breastfeeding duration, and infant sleep duration. We studied 1,110 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort study. The main outcome measure was child overweight (BMI for age and sex ≥95th percentile) at age 3. We ran logistic regression models with all four modifiable risk factors as well as the covariates maternal BMI and education, child race/ethnicity, and household income. From the model, we obtained the estimated probability of overweight for each of the 16 combinations of the four risk factors. During pregnancy, 9.8% of mothers smoked and 50% gained excessive weight. In infancy, 73% mother-child pairs breastfed for <12 m, and 31% of infants slept <12 h/day. Among the 3-year-old children in the cohort, 9.5% were overweight. In the prediction model, the estimated probability of overweight ranged from 0.06 among children exposed to favorable levels of all four risk factors, to 0.29 with adverse levels of all four. Healthful levels of four behaviors during early development predicted much lower probability of overweight at age 3 than adverse levels. Interventions to modify several factors during pregnancy and infancy could have substantial impact on prevention of childhood overweight. © 2008 The Obesity Society.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is clinically defined by the presence of (i) an urge to move the legs with or without an actual paraesthesia; (ii) a worsening of symptoms with inactivity; (iii) improvement with activity; and (iv) a worsening of symptoms in the evening and at night. Patients may use a variety of semantic phrases to describe their symptoms but all must have an urge to move. Most people with RLS also have periodic limb movements during sleep, although this is not part of the clinical diagnostic criteria. RLS is very common. About 10% of all Caucasian populations have RLS, although it may be mild in the majority of cases. Women generally outnumber men by about 2:1. As a general rule, RLS severity worsens through the first seven to eight decades of life, but may actually lessen in old age. The aetiology of RLS is only partly understood. There is a strong genetic component, and several genetic linkages and three causative genes have been identified worldwide. Several medical conditions, including renal failure, systemic iron deficiency and pregnancy, and possibly neuropathy, essential tremor and some genetic ataxias, are also associated with high rates of RLS. In all cases to date, the actual CNS pathology of RLS demonstrates reduced iron stores, in a pattern that suggests that the homeostatic control of iron is altered, not just that there is not enough iron entering the brain. The relationship between reduced CNS iron levels and the clinical phenotype or treatment response to dopaminergics is not known but generates promising speculation. Treatment of RLS is usually rewarding. Most patients respond robustly to dopamine receptor agonists. Over time, response may lessen, or the patients may develop 'augmentation', whereby they have a worsening of symptoms, usually in the form of an earlier onset. Other treatment options include gabapentin, or similar antiepileptic drugs, and opioids. High-dose intravenous iron is a promising but still experimental approach. © 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

N2  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate relationships among women's body attitudes, physical symptoms, self-esteem, depression, and sleep quality during pregnancy. Pregnant women (N = 215) at 15-25 weeks gestation completed a questionnaire including four body image subscales assessing self-reported feeling fat, attractiveness, strength/fitness, and salience of weight and shape. Women reported on 29 pregnancy-related physical complaints, and completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. In regressions, controlling for retrospective reports of body image, more frequent and intense physical symptoms were related to viewing the self as less strong/fit, and to poorer sleep quality and more depressive symptoms. In a multi-factorial model extending previous research, paths were found from sleep quality to depressive symptoms to self-esteem; self-esteem was found to be a mediator associated with lower scores on feeling fat and salience of weight and shape, and on higher perceived attractiveness.

N2  - For the first time, the relationship between depressive symptoms and sleep quality was explored prospectively during pregnancy. Participants (n = 273) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Beck Depression Inventory at three 8-week intervals, starting from 15-23 weeks gestation. In addition to sleep quality and depression remaining relatively stable during pregnancy, findings revealed that sleep quality earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms at later stage in pregnancy (after controlling for prior depression levels). In contrast, there was no evidence to suggest that depressive symptoms earlier in pregnancy impacted on sleep quality later on. Given that depressive symptomatology can lead to major depression and given the prevalence of pre- and postnatal depression, our findings suggest that screening for sleep problems during pregnancy may be of clinical significance. © 2008 European Sleep Research Society.

N2  - Background: We hypothesized that voluntary counselling and testing during pregnancy are necessary but not sufficient to provide the holistic psychosocial support needed by Jamaican women living with HIV and/or AIDS. Based on this hypothesis, we investigated a range of coping methods and support systems used by HIV-infected women and a group of their HIV-negative counterparts before, during and immediately after their pregnancies. Methods: Women attending obstetric clinics in urban Jamaica completed a quantitative survey aimed at discovering coping behaviours, social and spiritual support systems. Pre-survey focus group studies and key informant interviews contributed to the design of the questionnaire while post-survey focus groups were used to probe the validity of the data gleaned from the questionnaire survey. Survey data were analyzed using non-parametric tests for trend with independent univariate tests. Results: Fifty-five HIV-infected women and 51 HIV-negative women completed the survey. Compared with HIV-negative women, more HIV-infected women reported both feeling depressed (p = 0.07) and having difficulty concentrating (p = 0.05) during the month immediately prior to the study. Other statistically significant differences included: HIV-infected women were more likely to pray, to sleep and to change eating habits in response to worry and stress (p = 0.001 in each instance). Although several women declared religious faith, significantly fewer HIV-infected women were willing to talk to a religious leader about their problems compared to their HIV-negative counterparts (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Participation of HIV-infected women in post-survey focus groups augmented the survey findings. Many of the women reported negative emotions and some indicated serious challenges in accessing social support. The results point to the need for systematic documentation of psychosocial profiles as part of the approach to caring for these women. In addition, in the Jamaican sociocultural context, we recommend improved training of religious leaders and healthcare providers in psychosocial issues.

N2  - Background: Physical and hormonal changes during pregnancy alter breathing patterns of pregnant women. It is possible that occult disordered breathing during sleep may be a risk factor for the development of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia. Objective: Our aim was to determine the incidence of self-reported snoring in pregnant women, and to investigate the relationship of snoring, obesity and neck circumference to PIH and preeclampsia. Methods: 469 pregnant women and 208 age-matched nonpregnant women were included in the study. Both groups were asked to complete a questionnaire. Maternal complications were retrieved from the medical records. Results: Habitual snoring was reported from 1.9% of nonpregnant women, 2.5% of pregnant women prior to pregnancy and 11.9% of those same women during the third trimester of pregnancy (p < 0.001). Age, smoking during pregnancy, and weight before delivery were independent risk factors for habitual snoring in pregnancy. PIH and preeclampsia developed in 20 and 10.9% of pregnant women with habitual snoring, as compared to 11 and 5.8% of non-snoring pregnant women (p = 0.045, p = 0.125, p = 0.415), respectively. In women who developed preeclampsia, weight before pregnancy, weight before delivery and neck circumference were significantly higher in univariate analysis. Neck circumference was an independent risk factor for PIH and preeclampsia according to logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: The incidence of snoring is significantly higher in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women. Snoring may indicate a risk of PIH. Neck circumference was an independent risk factor for both PIH and preeclampsia. Copyright © 2007 S. Karger AG.

N2  - Although fatigue is a common experience for pregnant women and new mothers, few measures of fatigue have been validated for use with this population. To address this gap, the authors assessed psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) scale, which was used in 2 independent samples of pregnant women. Results indicated that the psychometric properties of the scale were very similar across samples and time points. The scale possesses a high level of internal consistency, has good convergent validity with measures of sleep quality and depression, and discriminates well from a measure of social support. Contrary to previous evaluations of the MAF, data strongly suggest that the scale represents a unidimensional construct best represented by a single factor. Results indicate that the MAF is a useful measure of fatigue among pregnant and postpartum women. © 2008 American Psychological Association.

N2  - Rationale: Psychological factors are acknowledged to impact on pregnancy, birth, neonatal outcomes and maternal mental health. The importance of psychological well-being is now recognized within maternity care and UK maternity policy advocates choice and control, equating this to increased quality of experience and improved psychological outcomes. There remains, however, lack of substantive and consistent evidence with regard to the psychological benefits of choice in maternity care. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of choice of maternity care on psychological health outcomes. Methods: 165 antenatal women were recruited and sampled according to their choices for care. Women were assessed utilizing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC), SF-36, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Culture Free Self-esteem Inventory (CFSEI) at 12 and 32 weeks pregnant and 14 days and 6 months postnatal. Results: No significant differences between groups were revealed on any of the scales or subscales measured. Significant and corresponding differences were identified within groups over time for CWS socio-medical worries, MHLC 'powerful others', SF-36 bodily pain, vitality personal health and change in health, PSQI global sleep. An interaction effect for CFSEI general and social self-esteem was revealed between birth centre and midwifery-led care/main unit women at 14 days postnatal. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that pregnancy represents a psychological challenge regardless of care type chosen and choice of no one care option confers greater psychological benefit across the maternity experience as a whole. It is possible, however, that differences in experience or environment at critical times can affect psychological status. © 2008 The Authors.

N2  - Women seem to have a heightened risk for developing sleep disorders compared with men; women also show a greater risk for developing some psychiatric problems including mood and anxiety disorders. The modulatory effects of sex hormones on sleep-wake behaviors and mood may contribute to this compounded risk and to the emergence of symptoms throughout the female reproductive life cycle. This article focuses on the clinical evidence for sleep disorders in women. Particular attention is paid to the hormonal and mood interactions with sleep disorders (sleep initiation and sleep maintenance) in the context of menstrual cycle changes, pregnancy, and in the menopausal years. Lastly, management strategies for sleep disorders in women are critically discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Over the past 40 years, it has been recognised that the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis undergoes adaptations through pregnancy and lactation that might contribute to avoidance of adverse effects of stress on the mother and offspring. The extent of the global adaptations in the HPA axis has been revealed and the underlying mechanisms investigated within the last 20 years. Both basal, including the circadian rhythm, and stress-induced adrenocorticotrophic hormone and glucocorticoid secretory patterns are altered. Throughout most of pregnancy, and in lactation, these changes predominantly reflect reduced drive by the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurones in the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pPVN). An accompanying profound attenuation of HPA axis responses to a wide variety of psychological and physical stressors emerges after mid-pregnancy and persists until the end of lactation. Central to this suppression of stress responsiveness is reduced activation of the pPVN CRF neurones. This is consequent on the reduced effectiveness of the stimulation of brainstem afferents to these CRF neurones (for physical stressors) and of altered processing by limbic structures (for emotional stressors). The mechanism of reduced CRF neurone responses to physical stressors in pregnancy is the suppression of noradrenaline release in the PVN by an up-regulated endogenous opioid mechanism, which is induced by neuroactive steroid produced from progesterone. By contrast, in lactation suckling the young provides a neural stimulus that dampens the HPA axis circadian rhythm and reduces stress responses. Reduced noradrenergic input activity is involved in reduced stress responses in lactation, although central prolactin action also appears important. Such adaptations limit the adverse effects of excess glucocorticoid exposure on the foetus(es) and facilitate appropriate metabolic and immune responses. © 2008 The Author.

N2  - To identify the concordance in assessments of health and social care needs of pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness as assessed by patients themselves and their mental healthcare professionals. Thirty-five staff-patient pairs were recruited from inpatient and community services. Staff and patients completed the Camberwell Assessment of Need-Mothers Version. There were significant differences in the total number of needs (p<0.01) and total number of unmet needs (p<0.001) reported by staff and patients themselves. There was moderate or better agreement on the presence of an unmet need in eight of 26 life domains. Agreement was low in several domains relevant to being a mother-notably pregnancy care, safety to child/others, and practical and emotional childcare domains. Unmet needs were particularly common in the areas of daytime activities, sleep, psychological distress and violence and abuse. Staff and pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness moderately agree about health and social care needs but agree less often on which needs are unmet. This highlights the importance of the views of the mothers themselves, as well as assessments by staff. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Oncofertility is one of the 9 NIH Roadmap Initiatives, federal grants intended to explore previously intractable questions, and it describes a new field that exists in the liminal space between cancer treatment and its sequelae, IVF clinics and their yearning, and basic research in cell growth, biomaterials, and reproductive science and its tempting promises. Cancer diagnoses, which were once thought universally fatal, now often entail management of a chronic disease. Yet the therapies are rigorous, must start immediately, and in many cases result in premature failure of the body's reproductive ability. In women, this loss is especially poignant; unlike the routine storage of sperm, which is done in men and boys facing similar treatment decisions, freezing oocytes in anticipation of fertility loss is not possible in most cases, and creating an embryo within days of diagnosis raises significant moral, social and medical challenges. Oncofertility is the study of how to harvest ovarian tissue in women facing cancer to preserve their gametes for future use with IVF, thus allowing the decisions about childbearing to be deferred and reproductive choices to be preserved. The research endeavor uses the capacity of the ovarian follicle to produce eggs in vitro. Developing the human follicle to ovulate successfully outside the body is scientifically difficult and ethically challenging. Infertility is linked to long-standing religious and moral traditions, and is intertwined with deeply contentious social narratives about women, families, illness and birth. Is the research morally permissible? Perhaps imperative if understood as a repair from iatrogenic harms? How are considerations of justice central to the work? How will vulnerable subjects be protected? What are the moral implications of the work for women, children and families? What are the implications for society if women could store ovarian tissue as a way of stopping the biological clock? What are the moral possibilities and challenges if eggs can be produced in large quantities from a stored ovarian tissue? Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological movement disorder. It is generally an underdiagnosed and undertreated condition. Patients with RLS suffer from sensory and motor symptoms evoked in the limbs at rest. Symptoms are worse at rest, are relieved by movement, and increase in the evening and during the night. The diagnosis is based primarily on the following four essential criteria: (1) an urge to move, usually associated with paresthesias, (2) onset or exacerbation of symptoms at rest, (3) relief of symptoms with movement, and (4) symptoms manifesting in a circadian pattern. Family history is present. The prevalence of RLS increases with age and is more prevalent in women than in men. RLS can be divided into primary and secondary forms, which are generally related to the age of onset. Well-documented secondary causes of RLS include pregnancy, end-stage renal disease, and iron deficiency. Most of the RLS pathophysiology work has focused on the dopamine and iron systems. The differential diagnosis of RLS includes both movement and sleep disorders. Effective treatment is available. Treatment of RLS begins with an assessment of potential factors in the patient's life that may aggravate RLS. These factors must be detected and must be either eliminated or modified. Several classes of medications are helpful, but dopaminergic therapy appears to be most effective and relieves symptoms rapidly. However, assessing the most bothersome symptoms and quantifying the severity of RLS are important because not all patients require medical therapy. Treatment should be individualized to suit each patient's needs. Copyright © 2008 by Türk Tibbi Rehabilitasyon Kurumu Derneǧi.

N2  - Orexin-A and -B are hypothalamic peptides which, in the adult brain, are associated with arousal, increased vigilance, and the seeking and ingestion of food. Because the fetus is mostly asleep, and hunger is a physiological state unlikely to arise until birth, we hypothesized that orexigenic neurons in the lateral and dorso-medial hypothalamic areas (LHA, DMH) and their projections to the locus coeruleus (LC) would develop only near the time of birth. We therefore determined orexin expression in fetal sheep, where birth occurs over a tightly regulated interval of 146-148 days gestation. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the presence and distribution of orexin-A positive fibres and cells at the level of the hypothalamus and LC in fetal (125-137 and 145+ days gestation age) and newborn sheep brains. Orexin was measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma samples taken from chronically catheterised fetal and newborn sheep, and in CSF taken from fetuses and lambs at postmortem. Orexin-A positive cells bodies were observed in the hypothalamus, and orexin-A fibres were found throughout all hypothalamic, thalamic, and brain stem regions of all the fetal and newborn brains examined. Orexin-A was present in plasma and CSF at similar concentrations in fetal and newborn sheep. The presence of orexin in hypothalamic neurons and CSF throughout late gestation suggests that orexinergic regulation of hunger, appetite and the sleep/wake cycle is inhibited, by mechanisms yet to be identified, until the time of parturition.

N2  - The term biological clock is usually used by physicians and psychologists to refer to the declining fertility, increasing risk of fetal birth defects and alterations to hormone levels experienced by women as they age. Female fecundity declines slowly after the age of 30 years and more rapidly after 40 and is considered the main limiting factor in treating infertility. However, there are several scientific reports, chapters in books and review articles suggesting that men may also have a biological clock. The aim of our study was to conduct a review of the literature, based on the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), to evaluate the male biological clock. After adjustments for other factors, the data demonstrate that the likelihood that a fertile couple will take more than 12 months to conceive nearly doubles from 8% when the man is < 25 years old to 15% when he is > 35 years old. Thus, paternal age is a further factor to be taken into account when deciding on the prognosis for infertile couples. Also, increasing male age is associated with a significant decline in fertility (five times longer to achieve pregnancy at the age of 45 years). Patients and their physicians therefore need to understand the effects of the male biological clock on sexual and reproductive health, in that it leads to erectile dysfunction and male infertility, as well as its potential implications for important medical conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

N2  - Objective: To report the case of a neonate presenting with nonautoimmune thyrotoxicosis and failure to thrive in whom an activating TSHR mutation was suspected. Methods: We describe the clinical and laboratory findings in a neonate who presented with nonautoimmune thyrotoxicosis and failure to thrive, including results of DNA analysis of TSHR, which encodes the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). Relevant literature is also reviewed. Results: The proband was born spontaneously at 35 weeks' gestation, and his early neonatal period was remarkable for meconium aspiration, pneumothorax, hepatomegaly with associated elevated transaminases, and direct hyperbilirubinemia. On days 9 and 11 of life, thyroid function studies revealed hyperthyroidism, which remained persistent on day 26 of life. On day 44 of life, the infant was admitted to the hospital. The mother reported he had an increased activity level, disturbed sleep, jitteriness, and exaggerated startle response. Weight was at the third percentile. After additional workup, Lugol's iodine solution, propanolol, and propylthiouracil were prescribed, which led to improvement in thyroid function. No TSHR antibodies were detected in the mother's or patient's sera. Analysis of the patient's DNA revealed a heterozygous T-to-C substitution at amino acid 568 in exon 10 (Ile568Thr), which predicts an isoleucine to threonine conversion in the second extracellular loop of TSHR. The mutation was not identified in the parents' DNA. Conclusions: A mutation causing constitutive activation of TSHR was confirmed in this patient, a finding that has implications for genetic counseling and consideration of total thyroidectomy or long-term thionamide therapy followed by radioiodide ablation as treatment options. Although rare, TSHR mutations should be considered in an infant presenting with thyrotoxicosis in absence of demonstrable TSHR antibodies in serum. © 2008 AACE.

N2  - Objective. To compare a so-called mild in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment strategy with the standard IVF treatment on the following aspects: the chance of a pregnancy resulting in full-term live birth within 1 year, patient discomfort, multiple pregnancies, and costs. Design. Randomised, open-label, prospective trial (www.controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN35766970). Method. 404 patients were assigned to undergo either a mild treatment, consisting of ovarian stimulation with a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist combined with single embryo transfer, or the standard treatment consisting of prolonged stimulation with a GnRH agonist combined with the transfer of two embryos. The primary outcome measures were: (1) the percentage of cumulative pregnancies within one year after randomisation leading to full-term live birth; (2) total costs per couple and child up to 6 weeks after expected delivery; and (3) overall patient discomfort. Analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle and was intended to show that the mild treatment was not inferior to the standard treatment; the non-inferiority threshold was -12.5%. Results. The proportion of cumulative pregnancies resulting in full-term live birth after 1 year was 43.4% in the mild and 44.7% in the standard treatment group. The lower limit of the one-sided 95% confidence interval was equal to -9.8%. The respective proportion of couples with multiple pregnancies was 0.5% versus 13.1% (p < 0.0001), and the average total costs were € 8,333.- versus € 10,745.- (difference: € 2,412.-, 95% CI: 703-4,131). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to anxiety, depression, physical discomfort, and sleep quality. Conclusion. After 1 year of treatment, the cumulative percentage of pregnancies leading to full-term live birth and the total patient discomfort were the same for the mild treatment (average 2.3 IVF-cycles) and the standard treatment (average 1.7 IVF-cycles). The mild treatment significantly reduced the number of multiple pregnancies and the overall costs.

N2  - This study re-examined the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant women in Japan based on the diagnostic criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG), and to epidemiologically clarify factors associated with RLS, including sleep disorders and pregnancy status. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at 344 clinical obstetric institutions in Japan. A total of 19441 women with a confirmed pregnancy were instructed to complete a self-administered questionnaire during the time they spent waiting for a consultation. univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used. The prevalence of RLS among the women was 2.9%. The prevalence by age group exhibited a U-shaped curve with the value for those in their thirties as the minimum. The prevalence became more than twice higher in the third trimester of pregnancy. There were stronger associations between RLS and the third trimester of pregnancy, multipara, smoking, subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, early morning awakening and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR: 1.92, 0.76, 1.54, 1.68, 2.44, 1.80, 1.89, respectively). The prevalence of RLS among pregnant women in Japan was not as high as previously reported, similar to that for the general Japanese population. As the prevalence of RLS is lower than that in Western countries, genetic backgrounds may contribute more to the observed differences than pregnancy does. In this study, like others, the prevalence of RLS increased during the third trimester of pregnancy, and strong associations were observed between RLS and difficulty initiating sleep and between RLS and difficulty maintaining sleep. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.

N2  - Introduction: Doppler sonography is an established method in fetal medicine. Up to now a possible circadian rhythm of fetal and maternal Doppler parameters has only been insufficiently characterized and documented. This survey aimed at evaluating the significance of Doppler parameters with regard to diurnal variations. We have analyzed whether or not a circadian rhythm of fetal and maternal Doppler parameters is detectable. Material and Methods: A non-selected collective of 100 patients with a singleton pregnancy between the 20th and 39th week of gestation was examined with Doppler sonography at the Medical School of Hannover. Besides the Doppler sonography, which was performed at three fixed times a day, the maternal blood pressure was examined each time. Outcome parameters were resistance index (RI), pulsatility index (PI) and the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the A. umbilicalis, A. cerebri media and the Aa. uterinae as well as the maternal blood pressure. Results: There were no significant differences for the RI, PI and V max of the Aa. uterinae for the whole collective, nor for the subgroups of maternal hypertonia, preeclampsia, notching and fetal growth restriction (IUGR). There were also no significant diurnal variations of the Doppler parameters for the fetal vessels. In particular, there were no differences in the measured Doppler parameters in comparison to the collective with unremarkable gravidity. In some subgroups statistical significance could be achieved, but due to the minor variations, no clinical importance has to be considered. Conclusion: A circadian rhythm of the Doppler parameters could not be confirmed in the examined collective. The time of the applied Doppler sonography on physiological conditions might represent a factor which does not affect the validity of the Doppler sonographic results. As a consequence a single Doppler examination at a freely chosen time seems to be sufficient to obtain a correct assessment of fetal and maternal blood perfusion. Further studies on larger collectives are necessary to evaluate the clinical importance of a possible circadian rhythm, especially in fetuses with pathological Doppler values. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

N2  - The purpose of this systematic review is to access the current state of knowledge concerning the role for melatonin in human pregnancy. Melatonin is a neuroendocrine hormone secreted nightly by pineal gland and regulates biological rhythms. The nighttime serum concentration of melatonin shows an incremental change toward the end of pregnancy. This small lipophilic indoleamine crosses the placenta freely without being altered. Maternal melatonin enters the fetal circulation with ease providing photoperiodic information to the fetus. Melatonin works in a variety of ways as a circadian rhythm modulator, endocrine modulator, immunomodulator, direct free radical scavenger and indirect antioxidant and cytoprotective agent in human pregnancy, and it appears to be essential for successful pregnancy. It also seems to be involved in correcting the pathophysiology of complications during pregnancy including those due to abortion, pre-eclampsia and fetal brain damage. The scientific evidence supporting a role for melatonin in human pregnancy is summarized. © 2008.

N2  - Background: Maternal exposure to wood fuel smoke may lead to impaired fetal growth due to hypoxia and or oxidative stress from smoke constituents such a carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Objectives: We studied the risk of low birth weight (LBW) and reduced mean birth weight in relation to reported use of wood for cooking during the prenatal period, compared with natural gas (NG). Methods: We studied a historical cohort of women who had a singleton live birth in the years 2000-2002, from a semirural area of Pakistan. Infants birth weight was obtained from records, and prenatal records had data for maternal body mass index and parity. Cooking habits, daytime sleep habits, and type of fuel used during the pregnancies in 2000-2002 were ascertained by a survey done in 2004-2005. We performed multiple linear and logistic regression modeling using propensity scores to adjust for confounding variables. Results: Unadjusted mean (± SD) birth weight was 2.78 ± 0.45 kg in wood users, and 2.84 ± 0.43 kg (p < 0.06) in NG users. Infants born to wood users averaged 82 g lighter than infants born to NG users when weight was adjusted for confounders (p < 0.07). The rate of LBW (< 2,500 g) was 22.7% among wood users compared with 15.0% in NG users (p < 0.01), for an adjusted relative risk of 1.64 (95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.34). The population attributable risk for LBW explained by wood use was estimated to be 24%. Conclusion: Cooking with wood fuel during pregnancy, a potentially modifiable exposure, was associated with LBW and marginally lower mean birth weight compared with using NG.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate psychological aspects of childhood asthma and the connections between the illness and behavioral disturbances in asthmatic children. Study design: We selected a group of 47 asthmatic children and a control group of 47 healthy children. The only criterion for inclusion was that the children be between 4 and 10 years of age; criteria for exclusion were neurological pathologies, cognitive retardation, and serious or chronic systemic disease. The collaboration of a psychologist and a comparative examination of questionnaires used in medical literature helped us prepare a calibrated questionnaire for our study. Results: In our study, the asthmatic children show significantly more behavioral and psychological disturbances than the children in the control group. Conclusions: Within the group of asthmatic children the boys and the children whose illness has lasted less than 4 years, are at greater risk of such disturbances; stressful situations connected to the birth or previous pregnancies can be seen more often in the group of asthmatic children than in the control group; before the onset of the illness the asthmatic children had significant sleep disturbances. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Aim: To analyse the importance of mothers' smoking during pregnancy and/or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in early childhood for children's health and well-being at the age of 3 years. Methods: Four groups from a population based cohort (n = 8850) were compared: children with nonsmoking mother during pregnancy and nonsmoking parents at the age of 3 years (n = 7091); children with only foetal exposure (n = 149); children exposed only postnatally (n = 895) and children exposed both pre- and postnatally (n = 595). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: Children exposed both pre- and postnatally had more wheezing (1.14; 1.07-1.21) and rhinitis (1.16; 1.06-1.26), used more cough-mixture (1.07; 1.01-1.14) and broncodilatating drugs (1.08; 1.02-1.15) and suffered more from excessive crying (1.31; 1.13-1.51) and irritability (1.27; 1.09-1.48) compared to children with nonsmoking parents. Children exposed only postnatally had more rhinitis (1.24; 1.12-1.37), used more cough-mixture (1.14; 1.05-1.29) and suffered more from poor sleep (1.26; 1.07-1.47) than children of nonsmoking parents. Children with prenatal exposure only used more broncodilatating drugs (1.45; 1.03-2.04) and suffered more from poor sleep (2.06; 1.09-3.87). Conclusion: Health differences, small but significant, indicate that prenatal and/or postnatal ETS exposure alone, or in combination, seems to interfere with child health, supporting the importance of zero tolerance. However, as most smoking parents in Sweden try to protect their children from ETS exposure, the results also might indicate that protective measures are worthwhile. © 2007 The Author(s).

N2  - Exposure to hostile conditions results in a series of coordinated responses aimed at enhancing the probability of survival. The activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis plays a pivotal role in the stress response. While the short-term activation of the HPA axis allows adaptive responses to the challenge, in the long run this can be devastating for the organism. In particular, life events occurring during the perinatal period have strong long-term effects on the behavioral and neuroendocrine response to stressors. In male and female rats exposed to prenatal restraint stress (PRS), these effects include a long-lasting hyperactivation of the HPA response associated with an altered circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion. Furthermore, male animals exhibit sleep disturbances. In males, these HPA dysfunctions have been reported in infant, young, adult and aged animals, thus suggesting a permanent effect of early stress. Interestingly, after exposure to an intense inescapable footshock, female PRS rats durably exhibit a blunted corticosterone secretion response to stress. In male PRS rats exposed to an alcohol challenge, the HPA axis is similarly hyporesponsive. Rats exposed to PRS also show behavioral disturbances. Both male and female PRS rats show high anxiety levels and depression-like behavior during adulthood, although some studies suggest that female PRS rats present low anxiety levels. With ageing, male and female PRS rats exhibit memory impairments in hippocampus-dependent tasks, while female PRS rats improve their memory performance during adulthood. The gender effect on behavior seems to be related to a reduction in hippocampal plasticity in male PRS rats, and an increase in female PRS rats. Despite the permanent imprinting induced by early stress, the dysfunctions observed after PRS can be reversed by environmental or pharmacological strategies such as environmental enrichment or antidepressive and neurotrophic treatments. Mechanisms underlying the effects of PRS on the offspring remain largely unknown. However, previous studies have demonstrated that maternal glucocorticoids during pregnancy play an important role in the HPA disturbances reported in male offspring. Finally, gestational stress has long-lasting effects on the HPA axis and on behavior in the dams. Alterations in maternal behavior could thus also make a strong contribution to the long-term effects of PRS, through epigenetic mechanisms. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with significant changes in sleep architecture and the subjective quality of sleep. These changes are caused by the many physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy (eg, altered hormone levels, increased urination at night, changes in body size) and post partum, especially with a newborn to tend. Although most women negotiate the disruption to their sleep very well, others may experience such severe disruption to sleep that it compromises their physical well-being and mental health. Physicians providing care for pregnant women must inquire about sleep patterns; if a woman is reporting significant difficulty coping with the disruption, a thorough history should be taken. Primary sleep disorders are common in pregnancy and further investigation and treatment may be warranted. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in late pregnancy is as high as 15%, a result of normal physiologic processes occurring during pregnancy, and its prevalence in pre-eclampsia is even higher. The cardiovascular risks associated with SDB have an even stronger association in pregnancy: with SDB in pregnancy there is an eightfold relative risk of developing systemic hypertension, primarily because the vascular inflammatory processes leading to endothelial dysfunction that occur in SDB are increased during pregnancy. The fetal effects of maternal cardiovascular compromise arising from SDB include growth restriction and impaired movement. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The main concerns associated with epilepsy during pregnancy consist of maternal and fetal risks from uncontrolled seizures, and harmful effects of the treatment on the development of the offspring. Although seizure control is maintained in the majority, worsening occurs in a fraction of childbearing women with epilepsy. As multiple factors associated with pregnancy may have a negative impact on epilepsy, a careful analysis of the situation should be performed in those who deteriorate. Emotional and behavioural influence, including insufficient sleep and treatment non-compliance, as well as physical factors, such as emesis and pelvic distortion, should receive attention. The serum concentrations of almost all antiepileptic drugs decrease during pregnancy, particularly those which are metabolised by glucuronidation. The inter-individual variability is pronounced. In highly protein-bound drugs, such as phenytoin and valproate, unbound drug is less affected than total concentrations. Lamotrigine and levetiracetam concentrations may decrease by more than 50% in the course of pregnancy; monohydroxyoxcarbazepine by up to 30-40%. Appropriate clinical follow-up tailored to individual needs and supported by therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed in pregnant women with epilepsy. Education concerning reproductive issues is an essential part of the epilepsy service to fertile women. © 2007 British Epilepsy Association.

N2  - Complications during pregnancy and birth asphyxia lead to brain injury, with devastating consequences for the neonate. In this paper we present evidence that the steroid environment during pregnancy and at birth aids in protecting the fetus and neonate from asphyxia-induced injury. Earlier studies show that the placental progesterone production has a role in the synthesis and release of neuroactive steroids or their precursors into the fetal circulation. Placental precursor support leads to remarkably high concentrations of allopregnanolone in the fetal brain and to a dramatic decline with the loss of the placenta at birth. These elevated concentrations influence the distinct behavioral states displayed by the late gestation fetus and exert a suppressive effect that maintains sleep-like behavioral states that are present for much of fetal life. This suppression reduces CNS excitability and suppresses excitotoxicity. With the availability of adequate precursors, mechanisms within the fetal brain ultimately control neurosteroid levels. These mechanisms respond to episodes of acute hypoxia by increasing expression of 5α-reductase and P450scc enzymes and allopregnanolone synthesis in the brain. This allopregnanolone response, and potentially that of other neurosteroids including 5α-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (TH-DOC), reduces hippocampal cell death following acute asphyxia and suggests that stimulation of neurosteroid production may protect the fetal brain. Importantly, inhibition of neurosteroid synthesis in the fetal brain increases the basal cell death suggesting a role in controlling developmental processes late in gestation. Synthesis of neurosteroid precursors in the fetal adrenal such as deoxycorticosterone (DOC), and their conversion to active neurosteroids in the fetal brain may also have a role in neuroprotection. This suggests that the adrenal glands provide precursor DOC for neurosteroid synthesis after birth and this may lead to a switch from allopregnanolone alone to neuroprotection mediated by allopregnanolone and TH-DOC. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the prevalence and factors associated with co-sleeping and nighttimewaking among the children of the Pelotas 2004 cohort at 12 months of age. Methods: All children born in the city of Pelotas, RS, Brazil during 2004 were enrolled on a longitudinal study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and once more at 12 months of age to obtain information on their sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics and on their children's sleep and the environment in which their children sleep. Co-sleeping was defined as habitually sharing the bed with another person. Multivariate analysis was performed using Poisson regression. Results: The prevalence of co-sleeping at 12 months was 45.8% (95%CI 44.2-47.3). Co-sleeping was more common among mothers with low socioeconomic status, less education, younger mothers, mothers with more previous births and among children who wake at night. The prevalence of nighttime waking was 46.1% (95%CI 44.6-47.7). Nighttime waking was more common among boys and among the offspring of mothers who had had a greater number of previous pregnancies and of mothers who had been employed while pregnant. Conclusion: Co-sleeping and nighttime waking are common among this study population, indicating a need to continue follow-up in order to observe how long these habits persist through childhood and to investigate their consequences for child development and behavior.

N2  - Research suggests that the attitude of men towards pregnancy, childbirth and child-caring is different from that of women. Up to now, research has focused mainly on motherhood. The aim of this study was to explore first-time fathers' experiences during early infancy of their children. Grounded theory and constant comparative method were used and 20 fathers aged 20-48 participated. Interviews were carried out in 2002-2003. 'Changing life' emerged as the core category consisting of the categories: becoming a father, alternating between work and home, changing relationship towards partner and developing relationship with their child. Changing life implied that they have left bachelor life and become responsible for a child. Becoming a father was much more fantastic than they could have imagined and they suggested that they performed childcare to the same extent as the mother when both parents were at home. Still fathers viewed the mother as the main parent, partly because of their alternating between work and home and because the mothers breast-feed the infants. Fathers' attitude towards breast-feeding seemed to be ambiguous; it was a matter of necessity, but made them feel insignificant. Changing relationship towards partner was common but it was not necessarily for the worst and often resulted in a more closely united relationship. However, tiredness because of lack of sleep could result in increased irritability towards problems. Developing relationship with their child implied increasing possibilities to learn to know the infant's signals. Fathers are one of two parents, and hence are important for their child's growth and development, emotional health and cognitive development. Knowledge about first-time fathers' experiences during the early infancy of their children may bring about increased support from midwives and child health nurses. © 2008 Nordic College of Caring Science.

N2  - Hyperprolactinaemia is the commonest endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and can lead to both short-term sexual dysfunction and galactorrhoea, and long-term loss of bone mineral density. Prolactin is secreted from the anterior pituitary gland under the influence of dopamine, which exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on prolactin secretion. Physiological regulators of prolactin secretion include many different types of 'stress' and sleep. Disruption of the normal control of prolactin secretion results in hyperprolactinaemia from pathological and pharmacological causes. The administration of antipsychotic medication is responsible for the high prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia in people with severe mental illness. Physiological hyperprolactinaemia, such as pregnancy and lactation, should be distinguished from pathological causes to prevent unnecessary investigation and treatment. The causes, consequences and management of hyperprolactinaemia are discussed in this article.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of circadian rhythm changes on fetal-placental development in pregnant rats. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Pregnant rats were randomly allocated to 4 groups with 10 rats in each group. Group 1: 12 hours light 12 hours dark period (n:10, Control Group); Group 2: 6 hours light 6 hours dark period (n:10); Group 3: constant light group (n:10); Group 4: constant dark group (n:10). Rats were made to deliver by cesarean birth at the end of their pregnancy and their placenta, number and weight of the offspring, and placental histopathological changes were examined. FINDING: Fetal number in the constant dark group was found significant in comparison to constant light group (p<0.01). Fetal weight in all groups with altered circadian rhythm was significantly lower than that in the control group (p<0.01). The decrease in fetal weight was more evident in the constant light group than in the constant dark group (p<0.01). Comparison of the histopathological findings of the placenta showed that placental edema, fibrin accumulation and leukocyte infiltration were significantly higher in constant light and constant dark groups than in other groups (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Circadian rhythm change in pregnancy adversely affects the fetal-placental development. More detailed studies are needed to clarify this mechanism.

N2  - Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is common in asthma patients and can contribute to sleep disruption. The aim of the present study was to determine the time related disribution of GER events together with their impact on sleep in asthmatic subjects with GER disease symptoms. The inclusion criteria were: 18-65 years, controlled moderate to severe asthma and GER-compatible clinical evidence. The exclusion criteria were: chronic obstructive lung disease, smoking, infections of the upper airways, use of oral corticosteroids, other co-morbidities, pregnancy, sleep-related disorders, night-time shift work, and the use of substances with impact on sleep. Asthmatic patients with nocturnal symptoms were excluded. All-night polysomnography and esophageal pH monitoring were recorded simultaneously. Of the 147 subjects selected, 31 patients and 31 controls were included. Seventeen patients were classified as DeMeester positive and 14 as DeMeester negative. Both groups displayed similar outcomes when general variables were considered. Sleep stage modification one minute prior to GER was observed in the DeMeester-positive group. Awakening was the most frequent occurrence at GER onset and during the 1-min period preceding 38% of the nocturnal GER. Sleep stage 2 was also prevalent and preceded 36% of GER events. In the DeMeester-negative group, awakening was the most frequent response before and during GER. Modifications in sleep stages, arousals or awakenings were associated with 75% of the total GER events analyzed during the period of one minute before and after the fall of esophageal pH below 4 in the DeMeester-positive group. These data provide evidence that sleep modifications precede the GER events in asthmatic patients.

N2  - Pregnancy impacts common symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), such as energy, appetite, weight change, and sleep and somatic complaints. However, it is not known whether the presentation of depression during pregnancy is different from that at other times in women's lives. This study compares the severity of symptoms of depression in 61 pregnant women with MDD (PD), 50 nonpregnant women with MDD (D), and 41 pregnant women without MDD (P). Despite equivalent overall depression severity, PD women had lower scores on suicidality, guilt, and early insomnia and higher scores on psychomotor retardation than D women. The severity of other depressive symptoms was similar in the two depressed groups. As expected on the basis of the selection criteria, overall depression severity and the severity of individual symptoms were significantly higher in the PD group than in the P group but effect sizes for somatic symptoms were smaller than for psychological symptoms. The results suggest that the profile of depression symptoms of women with MDD who are pregnant does not differ much from that of depressed nonpregnant women. Depressive symptoms, particularly psychological symptoms of depression, during pregnancy should be taken seriously and not be dismissed as a normal part of the pregnancy experience. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate barriers preventing pregnant women from using insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) 5 years after the launch of the national malaria strategy promoting these measures in Kenya. Methods: All women aged 15-49 years were interviewed during a community survey in four districts between December 2006 and January 2007. Women pregnant in the last 12 months were asked about their age, parity, education, use of nets, ITN, antenatal care (ANC) services and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (overall and for IPT) during pregnancy. Homestead assets were recorded and used to develop a wealth index. Travel time to ANC clinics was computed using a geographic information system algorithm. Predictors of net and IPT use were defined using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Overall 68% of pregnant women used a net; 52% used an ITN; 84% attended an ANC clinic at least once and 74% at least twice. Fifty-three percent of women took at least one dose of IPT-SP, however only 22% took two or more doses. Women from the least poor homesteads (OR = 2.53, 1.36-4.68) and those who used IPT services (OR = 1.73, 1.24-2.42) were more likely to sleep under any net. Women who used IPT were more likely to use ITNs (OR = 1.35, 1.03-1.77), while those who lived more than an hour from an ANC clinic were less likely (OR = 0.61, 0.46-0.81) to use ITN. Women with formal education (1.47, 1.01-2.17) and those who used ITN (OR: 1.68, 1.20-2.36) were more likely to have received at least one dose of IPT-SP. Conclusion: Although the use of ITN had increased 10-fold and the use of IPT fourfold since last measured in 2001, coverage remains low. Provider practices in the delivery of protective measures against malaria must change, supported by community awareness campaigns on the importance of mothers' use of IPT. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Glutaric aciduria type II is a rare disorder affecting the metabolism of fatty acid oxidation and several mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes. Narcolepsy and cataplexy is a disorder affecting sleep cycles and rapid eye movement activity. There is little information on outcome or management for either disorder in pregnancy. CASE: This is a case of a 16-year-old with glutaric aciduria type II and narcolepsy with cataplexy, treated with L-carnitine, riboflavin, fluoxetine, and modafinil during pregnancy. Intrapartum management included intravenous carnitine administration, and the patient underwent cesarean delivery at term without complication. CONCLUSION: This inborn error of metabolism and sleep disorder can be effectively treated during pregnancy with nutritional supplementation and stimulants. Because of the risk of cataplexy during labor, cesarean delivery is recommended to minimize the patient's risk. © 2008 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

KW  - review
N2  - Life-history trade-offs between components of fitness arise because reproduction entails both gains and costs. Costs of reproduction can be divided into ecological and physiological costs. The latter have been rarely studied yet are probably a dominant component of the effect. A deeper understanding of life-history evolution will only come about once these physiological costs are better understood. Physiological costs may be direct or indirect. Direct costs include the energy and nutrient demands of the reproductive event, and the morphological changes that are necessary to facilitate achieving these demands. Indirect costs may be optional 'compensatory costs' whereby the animal chooses to reduce investment in some other aspect of its physiology to maximize the input of resource to reproduction. Such costs may be distinguished from consequential costs that are an inescapable consequence of the reproductive event. In small mammals, the direct costs of reproduction involve increased energy, protein and calcium demands during pregnancy, but most particularly during lactation. Organ remodelling is necessary to achieve the high demands of lactation and involves growth of the alimentary tract and associated organs such as the liver and pancreas. Compensatory indirect costs include reductions in thermogenesis, immune function and physical activity. Obligatory consequential costs include hyperthermia, bone loss, disruption of sleep patterns and oxidative stress. This is unlikely to be a complete list. Our knowledge of these physiological costs is currently at best described as rudimentary. For some, we do not even know whether they are compensatory or obligatory. For almost all of them, we have no idea of exact mechanisms or how these costs translate into fitness trade-offs. © 2007 The Royal Society.

N2  - Our aim was to measure the correlation between fetal electrocardiographic (FECG) recordings of low-risk pregnancies and polysomnographic (PSG) study parameters in low-risk infants born at term as a measurement of perinatal sleep-development continuity. We designed a short, prospective, observational follow-up of physiologic parameters between fetuses and newborns. We studied 10 fetuses from low-risk pregnant female out-patients and the same subjects as low-risk newborns delivered at term. Fetal state (FS) was defined in FECG recordings reassembling the following: fetal state I (quiet sleep or QS); fetal state II (active sleep or AS); fetal state III (quiet waking), and fetal state IV (active waking). Percentages of AS, QS, and wakefulness in PSG studies of newborns were also determined. Comparisons of FS I with QS showed a significant reduction in QS, while comparison of FS II with AS showed significant reduction in AS. Negative correlations were found between FS I with QS, and FS II with AS. Number of cycles in FECG recordings and PSG sleep cycles also demonstrated significant correlation. In conclusion our data showed partial but significant sleep function continuity from fetal to neonatal period. ©Ivyspring International Publisher. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: To simultaneously investigate the polysomnography (PSG) and nonstress test (NST) records of pregnant women with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to observe NST changes during maternal desaturation and determine maternal and fetal outcomes. Methods: A prospective observational study of pregnant women assessed by questionnaire for symptoms of OSA. Women with self-reported frequent snoring or apnea were offered PSG and NST. Result: OSA was diagnosed in 4 (11.4%) of the 35 pregnant women who underwent PSG. Three (75%) had fetal heart decelerations accompanying maternal desaturation. The neonates of women diagnosed with OSA had lower mean Apgar scores and birth weights compared with neonates of women without OSA. Three neonates from the women diagnosed with OSA were admitted to the newborn healthcare unit. Conclusion: OSA in pregnancy has important maternal and fetal outcomes. Pregnant women should be assessed for symptoms of OSA and suspected cases should be offered PSG. © 2007 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

N2  - Obstetric cholestasis is an intrahepatic multifactorial disease, unique to pregnancy which presents with intense pruritis and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). It commonly presents in the third trimester and becomes more severe with advanced gestation. The prevalence of obstetric cholestasis is influenced by genetic and environmental aspects and varies in different populations. The pathogenesis appears to relate to a predisposition to the cholestatic effect of increased circulating oestrogens and progestogens. Also genetic mutations have been reported in a sub-group of women with elevated γ-GT. There can be significant maternal morbidity due to intense pruritis and consequent sleep deprivation. There may be malabsorption with steatorrhea resulting in vitamin K deficiency, prolongation of clotting times and increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). Caesarian section rate is much higher for women with obstetric cholestasis. The potential fetal risks include preterm labour and prematurity and unexplained intrauterine death. The aim of the management of obstetric cholestasis is to avoid fetal complications and to relieve maternal symptoms. A variety of drug therapies have been used to reduce maternal pruritis. Policies of active management and induction of labor before 38 weeks may improve pregnancy outcome. Obstetric cholestasis is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other causes of pruritis should be excluded.

N2  - Objective: The present study was conducted to evaluate serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in newly diagnosed patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Subjects and methods: Between April 2005 and March 2006, a total of 231 consecutive adult habitual snorers underwent polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory. Ninety-seven subjects were found suitable for hs-CRP measurement after application of the following exclusion criteria: patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, congestive cardiac failure, or smoking history, patients who were pregnant, on steroid treatment, on hormone replacement therapy, or with chronic use of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral anticoagulants and lipid-lowering drugs and patients having undergone upper airway surgery. Patients were classified as apneic [apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 5], obese non-apneic [body mass index (BMI) > 25, AHI < 5] and non-obese non-apneic (BMI < 25, AHI < 5). C-reactive protein levels were measured in stored sera by high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassay (Biocheck, Inc. Foster City, CA, USA). After checking normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and using a square-root transformation, Pearson's and partial correlation coefficients were calculated for identified risk factors and confounders. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify variables that were independently associated with hs-CRP. Results: The mean serum levels of hs-CRP were found to be 0.25 ± 0.23, 0.58 ± 0.55, and 0.51 ± 0.37 mg/dl in non-obese non-apneics (n = 23), obese non-apneics (n = 45) and apneics (obese and non-obese, n = 29), respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient of hs-CRP with BMI was found to be 0.25 (p = 0.01), and with AHI 0.16 (p = 0.12). Partial correlation analysis showed that hs-CRP levels correlated significantly with BMI after adjustment for AHI and age (r = 0.22, p = 0.03), while correlation with disease severity as assessed by AHI after adjustment for BMI and age was not significant (r = 0.10, p = 0.33). After stepwise multiple linear regression, only BMI was found to be significantly associated with serum hs-CRP levels (β = 0.02, p = 0.01). Conclusions: In this first comprehensive cross-sectional study on Indian subjects, we found that obesity, and not obstructive sleep apnea, is associated with elevated serum levels of hs-CRP. No independent correlation was found between severity of OSA and hs-CRP in the present study. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Four hundred and thirty pregnant women were recruited at approximately 22 weeks gestation at prenatal clinics. Of these, 86 (20%) were diagnosed as depressed. The women were seen again at approximately 32 weeks gestation and after delivery. Chronicity of depression was evidenced by continuing high depression scores in those women diagnosed as depressed. Comorbid problems were chronically high anxiety, anger, sleep disturbance, and pain scores. Less optimal outcomes for the depressed women included lower gestational age and lower birthweight of their newborns. Copyright © 2008 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Shorter sleep duration is linked to obesity, coronary artery disease, and diabetes. Whether sleep deprivation during the postpartum period affects maternal postpartum weight retention remains unknown. This study examined the association of sleep at 6 months postpartum with substantial postpartum weight retention (SPPWR), defined as 5 kg or more above pregravid weight at 1 year postpartum. The authors selected 940 participants in Project Viva who enrolled during early pregnancy from 1999 to 2002. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios of SPPWR for sleep categories, controlling for sociodemographic, prenatal, and behavioral attributes. Of the 940 women, 124 (13%) developed SPPWR. Sleep distributions were as follows: 114 (12%) women slept ≤5 hours/day, 280 (30%) slept 6 hours/day, 321 (34%) slept 7 hours/day, and 225 (24%) slept ≥8 hours/day. Adjusted odds ratios of SPPWR were 3.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.42, 6.94) for ≤5 hours/day, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.97) for 6 hours/day, and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.78) for ≥8 hours/day versus 7 hours/day (p = 0.012). The adjusted odds ratio for SPPWR of 2.05 (95% CI: 1.11, 3.78) was twofold greater (p = 0.02) for a decrease in versus no change in sleep at 1 year postpartum. Sleeping ≤5 hours/day at 6 months postpartum was strongly associated with retaining ≥5 kg at 1 year postpartum. Interventions to prevent postpartum obesity should consider strategies to attain optimal maternal sleep duration. © The Author 2007. Published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

N2  - Pemphigoid gestationis (PG) is a rare itching bullous disease of pregnancy and the postpartum period. We describe the use of a new methodology for measuring the nature and intensity of itching in a 21-year-old woman with pemphigoid gestationis. At 19 weeks gestation, she developed an itchy rash over the limbs, which spread to the trunk. Blisters then appeared on the hands which subsequently also involved the feet. Intense nocturnal wrist activities in this patient, measured with a wrist monitor and defined as average acceleration in the early hours of sleep, were even higher than that in patients with severe eczema, with an average value of 181.00 ± 43.49 (mean ± standard error) g/min for the first three hours, versus 84.47 ± 8.53 g/min for the group of 24 eczema subjects. Most wrist activities were slower movements at 0 to 1 Hz. This is in striking contrast to the scratching activities at 0 to 3 Hz in eczema subjects. There have been no therapeutic trials for PG. Topical steroid and oral antihistamines are usually ineffective, but worked in our patient. We also discuss the potential application of the monitor in assessing the nature of various dermatological or systemic itching disorders. © 2008 The International Society of Dermatology.

N2  - Objective: To identify biological and socioeconomic factors associated with the neurological development of Mexican infants born at term, as measured by brainstem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEPs). Subjects and methods: We conducted a cohort study among 76 women with low risk pregnancies recruited in their third trimester of pregnancy and followed their infants until 12 months of age. BAEP tests were conducted on the infants before 3 months of age during physiologic sleep, using 100 msec bipolar clicks. Maternal dietary intake was evaluated by food frequency questionnaire. Two BAEP groups (short latency, long latency) were identified by cluster analysis. The association between BAEP group and maternal PUFAs was estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for socioeconomic and biological factors. Results: Short latency BAEPs were associated with a maternal diet rich in arachidonic acid (OR = 3.63, 95% CI 1.23-10.67) after adjusting for age (in days) sex, head circumference and gestational age but was not significantly associated to a maternal diet rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Conclusions: Our results suggest the importance of arachidonic acid intake during pregnancy for short latency BAEPs and adequate fetal myelination. © 2007.

N2  - Migraine prophylaxis is a stepwise procedure with lifestyle advice followed by consideration of medications. Patients should be advised to try to maintain a regular lifestyle, with regular sleep, meals, exercise, and management of stress, perhaps through relaxation techniques or other ways that are sensible for them. If this regimen does not adequately control their migraines, preventatives are indicated. Patients can choose between evidence-based nutraceuticals such as riboflavin, feverfew, butterbur, or coenzyme Q10, or more traditional pharmaco-therapeutics. Medicine choices are somewhat limited by what is available in each country, but from the full range, the medicines of first choice are beta-adrenoceptor blockers, flunarizine, topiramate, and valproic acid. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers are particularly useful in patients also suffering from hypertension or tachycardia. Following recent studies, topiramate has become a first choice for episodic as well as chronic migraine. It is the only prophylactic drug that may lead to weight loss, but it is sometimes associated with adverse cognitive effects. Valproic acid and flunarizine also have very good prophylactic properties. However, valproic acid is often associated with adverse effects, and flunarizine is unavailable in many countries, including the United States. If sequential monotherapies are ineffective, combinations of first-line drugs should be tried before advancing to drugs of second choice, which are associated with more adverse effects or have less well-established prophylactic properties. Amitriptyline should be used carefully because of its anticholinergic effects, although it is useful in comorbid tension-type headache, depression, and sleep disorders. Methysergide is very effective, but it has been supplanted or even made unavailable in many countries because of its well-described association with retroperitoneal fibrosis. Pizotifen has a slightly better safety profile but is unavailable in the United States. Aspirin is particularly useful in patients needing platelet inhibitors for other medical conditions, but the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding must be considered. The prophylactic properties of magnesium, riboflavin, and coenzyme Q10 are low at best, but their lack of severe adverse effects makes them good treatment options. Magnesium may be particularly useful during pregnancy. Lisinopril and candesartan were shown to be effective in single trials and are preferable in patients with hypertension. Acupuncture may be another alternative; although controlled trials have failed to differentiate its effect from placebo, it is at least innocuous. Botulinum toxin A is not effective in the prophylaxis of episodic migraine. Copyright © 2008 by Current Medicine Group LLC.

N2  - Background: As pediatricians, we often experience agitated infants worrying their parents by crying for hours on end. Frequently, these infants are troubled by colics, but ever so often, no organic reason for such agitated behavior can be found. Prenatal as well as birth-related traumatization can lead to angst and emotional shock, thereby hindering the flow of qi in the body. Preterm babies can suffer a traumatization by the sudden birth and a sense of being "forced into the world" too early. The baby described in this case study was a preterm after 28 weeks with a very difficult postnatal period and extreme periods of agitation and crying. No objective reason for these "crying-fits" could be determined. Objective: To evaluate a diagnose using the criteria of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and then treat the baby accordingly, using laser acupuncture. Method: Heart rate monitoring over the 14 days before and during laser therapy. Discussion: Laser acupuncture treatment made the child calmer. The baby was able to relax and sleep more frequently. During the time of treatment, the mean heart rate dropped over more then ten beats per minute. Unfortunately, laser therapy could not be continued after the baby's discharge from the hospital. To improve parent-child-interaction, we decided to treat the child with a daily low dose of Phenobarbital. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

N2  - The incidence of positional plagiocephaly (PP) has increased during the last 2 decades in the Netherlands. Although this is generally solely attributed to the advice to put babies on the back during their sleep, other factors might be of influence. Because the advice to take folic acid (FA) was initiated in the same period as the sleeping advice, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of FA on PP.It is known that a daily intake of 400 μg of FA around the time of conception is advised in periconceptive women to prevent development of neural tube defects. The maximal daily dietary folate intake is considered to be 250 mg with a bioavailability of 50% to 70%. However, periconceptional women may take a multivitamin containing pteroylmonoglutamine in addition to a FA supplement (isolated pteroylmonoglutamine). Therefore, the daily intake of FA will exceed 1 mg daily, which is considered the upper limit of daily folate ingestion.Data from the "Maastricht Cohort and Intervention study about pregnancy related girdlepain" were used to study the amount of folate containing supplemental intake of all the 7526 women. In this study, women were prospectively questioned about their FA intake. The entire cohort, considered the control group, was compared with a subgroup of women within this cohort with children with PP, treated by a plastic surgeon, considered the PP group.Double use, defined as isolated FA preparations in addition to folate containing supplements (vitamins), was seen more frequently in women giving birth to children with PP. In the PP group, double use was seen in 33.3% of the women compared to 13.2% in the control group.Although no statistical analysis could be made because the PP group was too small, the use of too high dosages of FA might have an adverse effect in causing more PP. This article does not want to discuss the beneficial effect of FA during pregnancy. However, we observed a potential empirical relation between PP and FA double intake requiring attention in more extensive studies. ©2008Muntaz B. Habal, MD.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the potential benefit of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) administration in pregnant women recognized to have hypertension early in pregnancy. Methods: This is a randomized study comparing the addition of nasal CPAP treatment to standard prenatal care to standard prenatal care alone in hypertensive women treated with alpha-methyl dopa during early pregnancy. Pregnant women with hypertension were recruited by their obstetricians and completed baseline sleep questionnaires and visual analogue scales on snoring and sleepiness. Subjects were then randomized to receive either CPAP with standard prenatal care (treatment group) or standard prenatal care alone (control group) with routine obstetric follow-up. Nocturnal polysomnography was performed in all patients randomized to the treatment group for initial CPAP titration. Periodic assessment of blood pressure control and CPAP compliance was performed by the same specialist at each scheduled follow-up visit. Results: In the control group (n = 9), a progressive rise in blood pressure with a corresponding increase in alpha-methyl dopa doses was observed, beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy. There was also an increase in the number of non-scheduled post-natal visits during the first postpartum month. Pre-eclampsia occurred in one subject; the remaining eight patients had normal pregnancies and infant deliveries. In the treatment group (n = 7), blood pressure was noted to decrease significantly as compared to the control group with associated decreases in doses of antihypertensive medications at six months of gestation. All treated patients experienced uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered infants with higher APGAR scores at one minute post-delivery compared to those of controls. Conclusion: In pregnant women with hypertension and chronic snoring, nasal CPAP use during the first eight weeks of pregnancy combined with standard prenatal care is associated with better blood pressure control and improved pregnancy outcomes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - During pregnancy several physical and hormonal alterations may affect normal sleep and the respiratory system and predispose pregnant women to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) or worsen pre-existing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). SDB has been associated with several complications of pregnancy affecting maternal and fetal health. Clinicians should evaluate more closely obese pregnant women and those who develop hypertension. Early recognition and treatment of SDB may improve the outcome of pregnancy but the indications for treatment of OSAS need to be investigated. The diagnosis of OSAS in pregnancy requires a high index of suspicion and prevention of suspected SDB should be incorporated in the management of pregnancy. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality. Significant overlap exists between the risk factors for pre-eclampsia and sleep-disordered breathing. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been proposed as therapy for pre-eclampsia. This prospective, longitudinal study was designed to characterize sleep-related breathing patterns in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia risk factors, and to describe the effects of early nasal CPAP therapy in these patients. Methods: Twelve pregnant women with pre-eclampsia risk factors underwent polysomnography to characterize sleep-related breathing abnormalities and baseline blood pressure determination. Patients with airflow-limitation underwent nasal CPAP titration and were treated with optimal pressures. Periodic assessments of CPAP compliance and tolerance, sleep quality, and blood pressure control were performed until delivery or pre-eclampsia onset. CPAP retitration was performed between weeks 20 and 22 of pregnancy. Results: Mean respiratory disturbance index was 8.5 ± 2.6 events/h of sleep, and initial nasal CPAP pressures were 5-6 cm H2O with an increase to 6-9 cm H2O after recalibration. All subjects with chronic hypertension maintained blood pressures below 140/90 with a mean diurnal blood pressure of 122 ± 2.5 mm Hg over 83 ± 1.5 mm Hg. Patient characteristics of obesity and prior pre-eclampsia were associated with pregnancies complicated by spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, or pre-eclampsia. Conclusions: Early application of nasal CPAP in pregnant women alleviated sleep-related breathing disturbances but was not sufficient to prevent negative pregnancy outcomes. Obesity and prior pre-eclampsia appeared to be important factors and were associated with the worst complications. However, nasal positive pressure may still be beneficial to decrease severity of outcomes, particularly if individualized to patient risk factors, more particularly hypertension at pregnancy onset. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this paper is to summarize current knowledge about treatment of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias of central origin. Methods: The task force performed a systematic and comprehensive review of the relevant literature and graded the evidence using the Oxford grading system. This paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding treatment of these conditions, and summarizes key information about safety of these medications. Our findings provide the foundation for development of evidence-based practice parameters on this topic by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Results: The majority of recent papers in this field provide information about use of modafinil or sodium oxybate for treatment of sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Several large randomized, placebo-controlled studies indicate that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. We identified no studies that report direct comparison of these newer medications versus traditional stimulants, or that indicate what proportion of patients treated initially with these medications require transition to traditional stimulants or to combination therapy to achieve adequate alertness. As with the traditional stimulants, modafinil and sodium oxybate provide, at best, only moderate improvement in alertness rather than full restoration of alertness in patients with narcolepsy. Several large randomized placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that sodium oxybate is effective for treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, and earlier studies provide limited data to support the effectiveness of fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants for treatment of cataplexy. Our findings indicate that very few reports provide information regarding treatment of special populations such as children, older adults, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. The available literature provides a modest amount of information about improvement in quality of life in association with treatment, patient preferences among the different medications, or patient compliance. Conclusion: Several recent studies provide evidence that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. No studies were identified that report direct comparison of these newer medications with traditional stimulants. Despite significant advances in understanding the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, we do not have an ideal treatment to restore full and sustained alertness. Future investigations should be directed toward development of more effective and better tolerated therapies, and primary prevention.

N2  - Since postpartum blues was described by Savage in 1875, the controversy regarding its nature and cause has been sustained. In a first part, the author reviews the conventional clinical assessment of the blues as described in international medical literature. Its constitutive symptoms are mundane, of an affective, emotional, cognitive or psychosomatic nature. On the other hand, their originality resides in the mildness, unusual nature and progressive profile of their expression. Some elements speak in favour of the normality of this phenomenon, such as its mildness and great frequency. But others give indication of a pathological process, notably its links with various entities or illnesses such as the premenstrual syndrome, acute psychoses and postpartum depressive moods. This aspect has moreover led to search for shared causes to these different co-morbidities, such as a constitutional predisposition, somatobiological disorders, a psychosocial condition or psychodynamic mechanisms. This debate, however, is far from being settled. In a second part - and in continuity with a previous work - the author adds three other symptoms to this classical approach: drop in intrinsic weight, decrease of activity and positivity to the dexamethasone test. In order to do so, he defines the notion of "gross prepartal weight" (weight as measured before delivery) and "neat prepartal weight" (resulting from the substraction of the foeto-annexial package from the gross prepartal weight). At the same time, he compares these data with those resulting from a questioning of twenty-one new mothers out of a university hospital ward on obstetrical difficulties, end-of-pregnancy psychic disorders or PMS case history. These analyses establish no specific link between the appearance of blues, the average age of the parturients, the notion of previous blues, lacteal inhibition under bromocryptine. On the other hand, as stated in the literature, the appearance of postpartum blues is closely connected to previous PMS history, a painful delivery, or a psychologically difficult end of pregnancy. The originality of these results consists of two elements: (1) the correlation between the intensity of the blues and the weight gain during pregnancy; (2) a probable increase of neat weight, as the author has defined it, in the first days following postpartum. In a more general way, the role of weight variation stands out distinctly if the weight curves during gestation and the aggravation of psychiatric morbidity are observed in parallel. In the analysis of surgical blues by Illes, the severity of cluster scores of decrease of activity and of vigilance is noted, along with a culmination of the pathology on the second day (and not on the fifth day as in postpartum), which can justifiably be attributed to the suddenness and precocity of weight drop. Also related to the role of weight, numerous quasi-experimental, historical or clinical situations of weight loss and their psychiatric impact can be quoted. On another level, one should consider the decrease of activity in the approached situations. While basic metabolism increases during pregnancy progressively to 20%, delivery occurs through short but intense efforts. Postpartum implies a sudden deceleration in the course of which a physiological bradycardian phase around the fifth day can be underlined, as Magnin well described it. Some authors have positively correlated the blues to the intensity of labour, which corresponds to the degree of deceleration. In the same way, symptoms of sleep apnea syndrome have been linked to its fragmentation and to O2 desaturation induced intellectual lapses, but an involvment of diurnal fits of sleepiness cannot be rejected. In the same spirit, the activating role, prior to their mood stabilizing effect, of antidepressants is well known and the role of the musculorespiratory peak of the convulsive crisis in sismotherapies can be looked into. Finally, the nearly constant positivity to the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) is a symptom devoid of causal participation. Since Carrol's study, the frequent positivity of this test has been observed in depressed subjects. But there are multiple causes for positivity, starting with immediate postpartum, to such an extent that some authors have considered the test as more characteristic of the postnatal period than of any psychic disorder. However, the frequency of denutrition complications in DST - positive cases (insufficiently controlled diabetics, alcoholics, the aged and postpartum of course) is to be underlined. Numerous Anglo-Saxon authors have moreover put the emphasis on the link between weight loss and DST positivity, although they underlined the limits of this explanation. This is how the variations of activity may constitute an additional etiology. Actually, even if Weitzman has privileged the level of hypnic inhibition in regulating plasma cortisol, the inverted correlation between the latter's variations and those of activity is indeed striking. In this hypothesis, depressed subjects' curves would diverge mostly in the daytime to the extent of a difference in activity or a lack of activity more distinct than at night. To support this thesis, we will also point out the lower sensitivity of the test in ambulatory care, which may reflect a relative mildness of these cases but also a better activity, the standardization of the test when a depressive phase changes to excitement, the early standardization of the DST before the improvement of the mental state during sismotherapy or sleep deprivation. Weight loss and decrease in activity, which are of a physiological nature, would thus have a causal value, and the DST would only reflect these two elements. In the last part, the author engages in various physiopathological hypotheses and some commentaries. In his physiopathological hypotheses, he takes up Delay's idea of a regulating centre of mood, potentially subjected to variations of weight and activity. He mentions in particular that these variations may compensate each other, as with anorectics, or increase each other, as in postpartum blues. In his commentaries, he expands the previous ideas into his favourite theme, the deep motive for his research, which is the consubstantiality of acting and of being as the cornerstone of the holistic unity of the living, this concept being otherwise developed in an additional work quoted in reference. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Epidemiological studies indicate that sleep disturbances in general population are highly frequent. It is estimated that approximately 40 million people in the USA has some kind of problem with sleep. The most frequent sleep complaint is insomnia whose prevalence is around 50% some time in the life. Only a small part of this population refer their sleep problems to the medical doctor with the consequence that only a minority is adequately diagnosed and treated. Sleep problems may appear at any age, and the epidemiological studies indicate the increase of specific prevalence with advancing age, with a special increase in the adults. It is estimated that the prevalence of sleep problems in childhood and adolescence is present in 25-40%. Some of the problems are more frequent in the female population, although not as a rule. The best example for this is the observed prevalence of sleep apnea which is present in 24% of male and only 9% of female population. Sleep problems are often associated with other diseases such as psychiatric or kidney diseases (patients on hemodialysis). However, their frequency may increase in physiologic conditions such as pregnancy. Overall characteristic of sleep diseases is that they may compromise daily functioning by causing deficits in memory, decrease in concentration, depressive mood, irritability, decreased libido or erectile dysfunction, having as a consequence decrease in the quality of life.

N2  - Background: More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience back pain and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. The pain increases with advancing pregnancy and interferes with work, daily activities and sleep. Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions for preventing and treating back and pelvic pain in pregnancy. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Review Group's Trials Register (February 2006). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of any treatment to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of back or pelvic pain in pregnancy. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results: We found no studies dealing specifically with prevention of back or pelvic pain. We included eight studies (1305 participants) that examined the effects of adding various pregnancy-specific exercises, physiotherapy, acupuncture and pillows to usual prenatal care. For women with low-back pain, participating in strengthening exercises, sitting pelvic tilt exercises (standardised mean difference (SMD) -5.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.40 to -4.27), and water gymnastics reduced pain intensity and back pain-related sick leave (relative risk (RR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.92) better than usual prenatal care alone. The specially-designed Ozzlo pillow was more effective than a regular one in relieving back pain (RR 1.84; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.55), but is no longer commercially available. Both acupuncture and stabilising exercises relieved pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care. Acupuncture gave more relief from evening pain than exercises. For women with both pelvic and back pain, in one study, acupuncture was more effective than physiotherapy in reducing the intensity of their pain; stretching exercises resulted inmore total pain relief (60%) than usual care (11%); and 60% of those who received acupuncture reported less intense pain, compared to 14% of those receiving usual prenatal care. Women who received usual prenatal care reported more use of analgesics, physical modalities and sacroiliac belts. Authors' conclusions: All but one study had moderate to high potential for bias, so results must be viewed cautiously. Adding pregnancy-specific exercises, physiotherapy or acupuncture to usual prenatal care appears to relieve back or pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care alone, although the effects are small. We do not know if they actually prevent pain from starting in the first place. Water gymnastics appear to help women stay at work. Acupuncture shows better results compared to physiotherapy.
