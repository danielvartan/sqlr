TI  - Effect of hormone variations and other factors on symptom severity in women with 
      dystonia.
PG  - 235-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if any relationship exists between the severity of
      symptoms in women with dystonia and female reproductive hormonal variations.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We surveyed 279 women with dystonia seen at Mayo Clinic
      Scottsdale over a 6-year period (1990-1995), and 204 responded. The women were
      asked questions regarding their reproductive and menstrual histories and dystonia
      severity and other questions with an emphasis on possible exacerbating or
      relieving factors. RESULTS: Although in the majority of women hormonal influences
      had no consistent effect on dystonia symptom severity, 26 (41.9%) of 62
      premenopausal women noted a change in the severity of their dystonic symptoms in 
      relation to the 3 phases of their menstrual cycle. Other factors that exacerbated
      dystonia included stress and fatigue, while sleep improved symptoms. Pregnancy,
      menopause, and hormone replacement therapy had no effect on symptoms.
      CONCLUSIONS: Menstrual cycling may result in subjective worsening of dystonia
      symptoms in some women with dystonia. Further clinical and physiologic evaluation
      is indicated in such patients, as they may represent an important subgroup of
      dystonic patients that might yield some clues to the pathophysiology of dystonia 
      and to improved treatment strategies.

TI  - Physical mapping of porcine seasonality genes.
PG  - 143-6
AB  - Seasonal infertility in sows is a problem in the pig industry characterized by
      delayed onset of puberty in summer and decreased farrowing rate resulting from
      silent oestrus and aborted pregnancy. Summer infertility is thought to be
      influenced by heat, sunburn and stress. However, the strongest contributory
      factor is photoperiod. The difference in seasonality between wild boar and
      commercial pig breeds suggests that there may be a genetic component to this
      trait. The maps and associated molecular tools emerging from the pig genome
      project have created opportunities to examine the genetic component of seasonal
      infertility. We are identifying and mapping genes that are likely to be involved 
      in biological clock mechanisms and the melatonin pathways as candidate
      seasonality genes.

TI  - Managing women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Canadian consensus.
PG  - 299-301
AB  - QUESTION: I have a 30-year-old pregnant patient who is asthmatic and is taking
      prednisone. Whenever she decreases her prednisone dose, her nausea increases
      tremendously even though she is taking two tablets of doxylamine and pyridoxine
      combination (Diclectin) daily. She is already at 26 weeks' gestation, and I
      really do not want her to continue the prednisone beyond what is needed for her
      asthma, but two attempts to taper prednisone off failed because of unbearable
      nausea. ANSWER: Several controlled trials show the efficacy of prednisone for
      nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), but your case is fascinating in proving
      the point by challenge-rechallenge. You should try to decrease the prednisone
      while increasing doxylamine and pyridoxine to its recommended dose of two tablets
      before sleep, one in the morning, and on in the afternoon.

TI  - Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion is an inherent function
      of GnRH neurons, as revealed by the culture of medial olfactory placode obtained 
      from embryonic rats.
PG  - 138-44
AB  - To determine whether gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in culture
      without the hypothalamus secrete GnRH in a pulsatile fashion, the nasal placode
      (NAP) was obtained at day 13.5 of gestation and cultured by a roller tube method.
      If the GnRH release occurs in a pulsatile fashion, it can be said that the pulse 
      generator of GnRH exists inherently in each cell or community of cells in the
      culture. The concentration of GnRH in the NAP culture medium collected at 8-min
      intervals for 160 min after 2- to 4-week cultures showed that GnRH release
      occurred in a pulsatile fashion with a mean interpulse interval of 29.8 +/- 2.3
      min (n = 9). When the NAP was cultured with tissues of the forebrain vesicle (n =
      3) or the hypothalamus (n = 4), GnRH was also released in a pulsatile fashion
      with similar intervals (27.3 +/- 1.0 min for the NAP+forebrain vesicle culture
      and 36.0 +/- 6.3 min for the NAP+hypothalamus culture) as those in cultures
      without brain tissues. It is concluded that pulsatile GnRH release is an inherent
      function of GnRH neurons.

TI  - Neonatal alcohol exposure produces more severe motor coordination deficits in
      high alcohol sensitive rats compared to low alcohol sensitive rats.
PG  - 93-9
AB  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol can produce a number of behavioral alterations,
      including hyperactivity, learning deficits and motor impairments. However, the
      severity and nature of behavioral alterations varies markedly among children of
      women who drink during pregnancy. One important determinant of this variation may
      be genetic differences in the response to alcohol. Recently, we demonstrated that
      exposure to alcohol during development produced hyperactivity in rats bred for
      high alcohol sensitivity (HAS), but not in rats bred for low alcohol sensitivity 
      (LAS). These lines were selectively bred for extremes in alcohol-induced "sleep
      time." The present study investigated the effects of ethanol exposure during
      development on motor coordination later in life in both HAS and LAS rats. Using
      an artificial rearing procedure, neonatal pups from each line were exposed to a
      binge-like alcohol treatment on postnatal days (PD) 4-9. Within each line, one
      group was exposed to ethanol (6.0 g/kg/day), one group served as an artificially 
      reared control, and a third served as a normally reared control group. On PD 30, 
      parallel bar motor performance was evaluated. Exposure to ethanol during
      development severely impaired motor performance in the HAS rats compared to their
      controls. In LAS rats, early ethanol exposure produced only mild and
      nonsignificant effects on motor performance. Thus, HAS rats were more vulnerable 
      to ethanol-induced motor deficits compared to the LAS rats. Importantly, there
      were no differences in peak blood alcohol level between the lines, indicating
      that vulnerability to ethanol's teratogenic effects was not due to differences in
      metabolic rate. These results suggest that genetic differences in response to
      alcohol may serve as a predictor for susceptibility to ethanol's teratogenic
      effects.

TI  - Influence of maternal smoking on autonomic nervous system in healthy infants.
PG  - 215-20
AB  - To determine the influence of maternal smoking on autonomic nervous system in
      healthy infants, 36 infants were recorded polygraphically for one night. Their
      mothers were defined, according to their smoking frequency during pregnancy, as
      "nonsmokers" (no cigarettes smoked during pregnancy) or "smokers" (10 or more
      cigarettes per day). The infants had a median postnatal age of 10.5 wk (range 6
      to 16 wk); 18 were born to nonsmokers, and 18 to smokers. During the whole night,
      spectral analyses of heart rate (HR) were evaluated as a function of sleep
      stages. Two major peaks were recognizable: a low-frequency component (LF) related
      to sympathetic and parasympathetic activities and a high-frequency component (HF)
      reflecting parasympathetic tonus. The ratio of LF/HF powers was calculated as an 
      index of sympathovagal interaction. In REM sleep, "smokers" infants were
      characterized by significantly lower HF powers and normalized HF powers, and
      higher LF/HF ratios than "nonsmokers." The finding did not reach statistical
      significance in NREM sleep. In conclusion, maternal smoking induced changes in
      autonomic control and maturation in infants. These effects of cigarette smoke
      exposure can be added to those already reported and offer additional evidence for
      counseling mothers to stop smoking.

TI  - Investigation of nonlinear ECoG changes during spontaneous sleep state changes
      and cortical arousal in fetal sheep.
PG  - 142-8
AB  - We examined the processes of cortical activation and deactivation of the fetal
      brain during spontaneous sleep state transitions and during central nervous
      processing of vibroacoustic stimulations (VASs) using nonlinear analysis of the
      electrocorticogram (ECoG). Tests of nonlinearity and a random shuffling routine
      revealed deterministic and nonlinear portions in the fetal ECoG. As common
      nonlinear measures are not applicable to nonstationary time series, we developed 
      an algorithm to estimate the predictability of the ECoG in its time course by
      means of a point prediction error (PPE). The ECoG was recorded before and during 
      VAS from the maternal abdominal surface in seven chronically instrumented fetal
      sheep at 0.8 of gestation. The PPE during REM sleep was significantly higher than
      during NREM sleep. VAS in NREM sleep resulted in an abrupt increase of the PPE
      not reaching the level of REM sleep. The steep increase of the PPE at onset and
      its slow decrease after cessation of the stimulus were very similar to the
      dynamics of spontaneous sleep state transitions, suggesting the involvement of
      the same cortical activating mechanisms. In conclusion, the stage and the time
      course of fetal brain activation and deactivation patterns can be clearly shown
      by PPE techniques. The PPE is a useful complement to spectral analysis. Both
      techniques describe different properties of the ECoG.

TI  - Continuous measurements of instantaneous heart rate and its fluctuations before
      and after hatching in chickens.
PG  - 895-903
AB  - There has been considerable interest in heart rate (fh) fluctuations in relation 
      to cardiovascular control systems and foetal conditions during pregnancy in
      mammals. Prominent fluctuations in fh also occur in avian embryos, which are an
      important experimental model for studying developmental physiology. The present
      study determined the instantaneous fh of seven chick embryos continuously from
      the last stage of prenatal development (day 18), throughout the pipping
      (perinatal) period (days 19-21) until hatching and, subsequently, of newly
      hatched chicks (up to day 2). The distinctive patterns of instantaneous fh
      fluctuations took the form of specific changes within a broad mean fh baseline.
      Cyclic oscillations (ultradian rhythm) occurred until an early stage of the
      perinatal period, when the fh baseline started rising. Subsequently, the baseline
      dropped and respiratory arrhythmia began to appear concomitant with external
      pipping. During the final stage of external pipping, when the fh baseline rose
      again prior to hatching, three unique patterns of instantaneous fh fluctuations
      were evident: relatively long-lasting cyclic small accelerations, irregular
      intermittent large accelerations and short-term repeated large accelerations.
      Furthermore, repeated alternate occurrences of the latter two types of
      acceleration formed an additional oscillating pattern with a period of 10-15 min.
      During the early period after hatching, when the fh baseline reached its maximum,
      instantaneous fh changed relatively slowly accompanied by transient rapid
      decelerations, probably due to augmented vagal tone. Subsequently, the mean fh
      baseline dropped to its minimum, and a circadian rhythm and three types of
      previously reported fh fluctuations (types I-III) appeared. Developmental
      patterns of mean fh and the appearance of distinctive patterns of instantaneous
      fluctuations in fh and circadian rhythms were not influenced by an ultimate
      failure of hatching after a normal development. The demonstration of complex,
      repeatable patterns of fh fluctuation that change during development suggests
      that the avian embryo model should be useful in studying the phenomenon of fh
      fluctuation and its underlying causes.

TI  - Ventilatory and arousal responses of sleeping lambs to respiratory challenges:
      effect of prenatal maternal anemia.
PG  - 641-8
AB  - We have examined the effects of exposure to chronic maternal anemia, throughout
      the final one-third of gestation, on postnatal ventilatory and arousal responses 
      to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and combined hypoxia-hypercapnia in sleeping lambs.
      While resting quietly awake, lambs from anemic ewes had higher arterial PCO(2)
      levels than control animals during the first 2-3 postnatal wk, but pH, arterial
      PO(2), and arterial O(2) saturation were not different. During active and quiet
      sleep lambs from anemic ewes had higher end-tidal CO(2) levels than control
      animals when breathing room air and at the time of spontaneous arousal or when
      aroused by progressive hypercapnia or by combined hypoxia-hypercapnia.
      Ventilation and arterial O(2) saturation during uninterrupted sleep and
      ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia (inspiratory O(2) fraction, 10%),
      progressive hypercapnia, and combined hypoxia/hypercapnia were not significantly 
      affected by exposure to maternal anemia. Our findings show that maternal anemia
      results in elevated PCO(2) levels in the offspring. This effect may be due, at
      least in part, to altered pulmonary function.

TI  - Emergency physician hiring practices: the effects of certain conditions on
      employability.
PG  - 17-20
AB  - This study evaluated the impact of certain Emergency Physician (EP) conditions on
      hiring decisions by fellow EPs. An anonymous survey asked 255 Pennsylvania EPs to
      rate the likelihood of their voting to offer a position in each of six scenarios.
      Three scenarios consisted of EPs unable to work regular shifts because of
      periodic migraines, a sleep disorder, and periodic difficulty handling stress.
      The other scenarios involved an EP with a probable future pregnancy, a recovered 
      alcoholic, and a healthy HIV-positive physician. Most respondents said they were 
      unlikely to recommend hiring colleagues who disclose a disorder restricting their
      availability for regular shifts. EPs were generally tolerant of recovered
      alcoholics and plans for pregnancy leave, but nearly half had significant
      reservations regarding hiring HIV-positive peers. An understanding of which
      conditions negatively impact an EP's ability to obtain employment in Emergency
      Medicine may be useful in emergency medicine career counseling or in the process 
      of obtaining disability coverage.

TI  - Parity and sleep patterns during and after pregnancy.
PG  - 14-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in women's sleep patterns from prepregnancy to
      postpartum. METHODS: Polysomnography was done in women's homes for 2 consecutive 
      nights. Forty-five women were studied during the follicular and luteal phases of 
      their menstrual cycles, and 33 conceived and were studied during each trimester
      of pregnancy. Twenty-nine were studied at 1 and 3 months postpartum. RESULTS:
      Compared with prepregnant sleep characteristics, significant changes in sleep
      patterns were evident by 11-12 weeks' gestation, with a significant increase in
      total sleep time but less deep sleep and more awakening during sleep. By the
      third month postpartum, there was improvement in sleep characteristics; however, 
      sleep efficiency remained significantly lower than baseline prepregnancy values. 
      CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbance was greatest during the first postpartum month,
      particularly for first-time mothers.

PG  - 979-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the fertility data in Aragon, Spain. METHODS: A survey
      was conducted in several companies during 1997 and 1998. Participation in the
      survey was optional, participants were not identified and a table of random
      figures was utilized. Error 2 +/- 2.98, 95% confidence interval, P = Q = 50%.
      RESULTS: 139 employees participated in the survey; 94% were male, 6.4% were
      single, 87.7% married, 5.7% had a stable partner, 12.3% had higher level, 53.6%
      medium and 34% elementary level education. Mean number of children per couple was
      1.7 and mean number of children desired was 1.9. Mean time from decision to have 
      children to pregnancy was 4.5 months. Mean age at conception of the first child
      was 28 years for the men and 25 years for the women. One of the partners was
      employed in 42.7% of the cases. Mean working hours was 8.3 and mean number of
      years in the same job was 14.5. Twenty-one percent considered they were exposed
      to toxic substances. Mean hours of sleep was 6 hours, 35% took warm baths and
      24.4% used tight-fitting underclothes. Ninety percent drank alcohol and/or coffee
      mild to moderately and 50% were smokers. No significant differences were found in
      the number of children according to level of education, type of work or if one of
      the partners or both were employed. A clearly negative correlation was found
      between the year of birth and the number of children desired. CONCLUSION: In
      Aragon, the birthrate trend remains low and does not appear to be influenced by
      the economic level, life style, type of job or whether or not both partners are
      employed.

PG  - 137-41
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study the relationship between snoring and
      pregnancy-induced hypertension and growth retardation of the fetus. DESIGN:
      Retrospective, cross-sectional, consecutive case series. SETTING: The Department 
      of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital, Umea, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS AND
      MEASUREMENTS: On the day of delivery, 502 women with singleton pregnancies
      completed a questionnaire about snoring, witnessed sleep apneas, and daytime
      fatigue. Data concerning medical complications were taken from the women's
      casebooks. RESULTS: During the last week of pregnancy, 23% of the women reported 
      snoring every night. Only 4% reported snoring before becoming pregnant.
      Hypertension developed in 14% of snoring women, compared with 6% of nonsnorers (p
      < 0.01). Preeclampsia occurred in 10% of snorers, compared with 4% of nonsnorers 
      (p < 0.05). An Apgar score < or = 7 was more common in infants born to habitual
      snorers. Growth retardation of the fetus, defined as small for gestational age at
      birth, had occurred in 7.1% of the infants of snoring mothers and 2.6% of the
      remaining infants (p < 0.05). Habitual snoring was independently predictive of
      hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 2.03; p < 0.05) and growth retardation (OR, 3.45; 
      p < 0.01) in a logistic regression analysis controlling for weight, age, and
      smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Snoring is common in pregnancy and is a sign of
      pregnancy-induced hypertension. Snoring indicates a risk of growth retardation of
      the fetus.

TI  - Effects of prenatal cocaine/crack and other drug exposure on
      electroencephalographic sleep studies at birth and one year.
PG  - 39-48
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the neurophysiologic effects of prenatal
      cocaine/crack use. The aim of this study, designed to overcome methodologic
      limitations of previous research, was to investigate the effects of prenatal
      cocaine use on electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep patterns, a marker of central 
      nervous system development. METHODS: In a longitudinal study of prenatal
      cocaine/crack exposure, women were interviewed at the end of each trimester about
      cocaine, crack, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use. Two-hour paper- 
      and computer-generated EEG sleep recordings were obtained on a sample of the
      full-term infants on the second day of life and at 1 year postpartum. Eligible
      newborns were full-term, had received no general anesthesia, and had a 5-minute
      Apgar score >5. All infants whose mothers used one or more lines of cocaine
      during their first trimester or any crack (n = 37) were selected. A comparison
      group was chosen randomly from the group of women who did not use cocaine or
      crack during their pregnancy (n = 34). RESULTS: Women who used cocaine/crack
      during the first trimester were older, less educated, less likely to be working, 
      and used more tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs than women who
      did not use cocaine/crack during the first trimester. There were no differences
      in infant birth weight, length, head circumference, or gestational age between
      the two exposure groups. After controlling for the significant covariates,
      prenatal cocaine exposure was associated with less well developed spectral
      correlations between homologous brain regions at birth, and with lower spectral
      EEG power values at 1 year of age. Prenatal alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use
      were found to affect state regulation and cortical activities. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results indicate that the neurotoxic effects of prenatal cocaine/crack use can be
      detected with quantitative EEG measures.

TI  - The voiding pattern of healthy preterm neonates.
PG  - 278-81
AB  - PURPOSE: To elucidate further the maturation of voiding habits from gestation to 
      infancy we investigated the free voiding pattern of healthy preterm neonates.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 11 male and 8 female healthy preterm newborns
      at a mean of 32 weeks after cessation of menstrual flow (postmenstrual age).
      Assessment was done in the neonatal ward using 4-hour voiding observation, a
      method described previously in studies of free voiding pattern of full-term
      newborns. RESULTS: The voiding pattern of male and female preterm neonates was
      characterized by 1 void per hour and a mean voided volume of 53% of bladder
      capacity with 58% frequency of interrupted voiding. Residual urine was increased 
      but varied during observation (mean 11% bladder capacity) and was 0 after at
      least 1 void during 4 hours in 14 of the 19 subjects. Two-thirds of all voiding
      occurred during sleep, whereas a third of the newborns showed signs of arousal
      with a mean awake time of only 17 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: The voiding pattern of
      preterm versus full-term subjects is characterized by an increased number of
      interrupted voidings, further indicating that these voidings represent immature
      behavior of detrusor-sphincter coordination. Also, the high number of voidings
      during sleep suggest a more immature pattern for preterm newborns.

TI  - [Rett's syndrome: report of 5 cases in Tunisia].
PG  - 955-9
AB  - We report 5 girls presenting Rett syndrome. All of them were from south Tunisia. 
      They fulfilled the Rett syndrome diagnosis criteria (The Rett syndrome diagnosis 
      criteria work group, 1988). Pregnancy, birth and psychomotor development during
      the first year of live were normal. The mean age at the onset was 19.8 +/- 2.5
      months. The two revealing symptoms were psychomotor regression (3 cases) and
      epilepsy (2 cases). They were admitted to our ward at a mean age of 4.7 +/- 1.5
      years. Clinical presentation was typical of Rett syndrome. Mental retardation,
      stereotypic hand movement (hand washing/wringing or clapping/tapping) and loss of
      purposeful manual skills were noted in all cases. Gait was apraxic and increase
      of head circumference was slowed. Additional features included, respiratory
      dysfunction (episodic hyperventilation and breath-holding), epilepsy, scoliosis
      (4 cases), growth retardation and spasticity (3 cases). Electroencephalography
      showed slow activity with multifocal epileptiform abnormalities. Sleep enhanced
      these EEG abnormalities. MRI and CT-scan disclosed non specific cortical and
      sub-cortical atrophy. All cases were isolated and parents were consanguineous in 
      3 cases. Rett syndrome is relatively frequent in Europe, but in Tunisia this
      disease remains rare and certainly underdiagnosed.

TI  - [Medical and psychological status of one-year-old premature babies without severe
      disability. Case-control prospective study].
PG  - 1163-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: This case-control prospective study was conducted to determine
      whether and how medical, psychological and affective development differs from
      premature to full-term newborns without severe disability. POPULATION AND
      METHODS: Newborns under or at 33 weeks gestation (W) were included from December 
      1992 to January 1994 and were matched with two controls. The same examiners
      evaluated each infant at the effective postnatal age of nine to ten months.
      RESULTS: Fifty premature babies (average gestational age [GA] = 30.7 W) were
      compared to 100 controls. The main problems were bronchopulmonary (P = 0.03) and 
      sleep (P = 0.027) disorders. Motor disability was suspected in 9% of the cases
      and none control (P = 0.00003, OR = 3.44). By multivariate analysis, cases
      differed from the controls by infant-mother relation disturbances (OR = 13.3),
      motherhood anxiety (OR = 13.3), poor expressiveness (OR = 5.6), peripheral tonus 
      anomalies (OR = 39.5) and sleep troubles (OR = 5.8). CONCLUSION: Premature
      newborns had risks for the child-mother relation but not for psychoaffective
      development disturbances.

      trimester.
PG  - 606-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of psychosocial and demographic variables 
      to health behaviors in early pregnancy. DESIGN: First trimester findings
      presented from a prospective study of weight gain in pregnancy. SETTING: A
      comprehensive health care system in central Texas. PARTICIPANTS: 114 pregnant
      women (75% white, 13% African American, 10% Hispanic, 2% Asian) of 12 weeks
      gestation or less. OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-Care Inventory, which includes
      diet/eating, substance abuse, recklessness, hygiene-related practices,
      sleep/rest, and exercise behaviors. RESULTS: In regression analysis the final
      model of demographic and psychosocial variables showed that higher depressive
      symptoms, lower internal locus of control for fetal health, and lower family
      income were related to poorer health behaviors in the 1st trimester of pregnancy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Health behaviors in early pregnancy may be affected by psychosocial 
      factors such as depressive symptoms. Greater emphasis should be given to such
      factors in research and prenatal assessments.

TI  - [Children and adolescents with Down syndrome in Sor-Trondelag 1978-97].
PG  - 3743-6
AB  - Ultrasound examination offered to nearly all pregnant women in Norway may lead to
      the identification of fetuses with Down's syndrome. This may lead to termination 
      of pregnancies and to a reduction in the prevalence of live-borns with Down's
      syndrome. In a retrospective study of hospital records we have examined the
      prevalence of Down's syndrome, associated malformations and diseases during the
      last 20 years. 68 children and adolescents with Down's syndrome were identified. 
      43 were born 1988-97 (1.16 per 1,000 births) and 25 1978-87 (0.8 per 1,000
      births; p = 0.13). Congenital heart defects were diagnosed in 33 children (49%). 
      Five children (7.4%) had died by the end of 1997, four with a cardiovascular
      defect. Four children had moved out of the region. Among 59 persons alive at the 
      time of study, 11 (19%) were treated for hypothyroidism, 26 (44%) had been
      hospitalised because of infections, and 14 (20%) suffered from problems with
      sleep obstruction. 23 (39%) had impairments in hearing and 30 (51%) in vision.
      Ten children (18%) had a weight-for-height above the 97.5 percentile of standard 
      growth charts for Norwegian children. Serum concentration of zink was below
      reference values in 15 children. We conclude that the prevalence of livebirths
      with Down's syndrome was not reduced in 1988-97 compared to 1978-87. Children
      with Down's syndrome have a wide range of somatic disorders and need close and
      systematic medical follow-up.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnoea in a puerperal patient with Hallermann-Streiff syndrome.
PG  - 974-7
AB  - A 26 yr old puerperal female with Hallermann-Streiff syndrome developed serious
      obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome during pregnancy. She underwent an elective
      Caesarean section delivery, but ending the pregnancy did not improve her clinical
      symptoms. By treating her with nasal continuous positive airway pressure, a
      worsening of her headaches and glaucoma was prevented. The administration of
      acetazolamide controlled all of her symptoms. Treatment with nasal ventilation is
      the best initial approach. It is also important to assure normal oxygenation
      before pregnancy since the foetus may suffer from the severe deprivation that may
      occur in these patients.

PG  - 961-8
AB  - These are the first clinical guidelines published for the treatment of Restless
      Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD) providing
      evidence-based practice parameters. They were developed by the Standards of
      Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the
      American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The guidelines provide recommendations for
      the practice of sleep medicine in North America regarding the treatment of RLS
      and PLMD. Recommendations are based on the accompanying comprehensive review of
      the medical literature regarding treatment of RLS and PLMD which was developed by
      a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.
      Recommendations are identified as standards, guidelines, or options, based on the
      strength of evidence from published studies that meet criteria for inclusion.
      Dopaminergic agents are the best studied and most successful agents for treatment
      of RLS and PLMD. Specific recommendations are also given for the use of opioid,
      benzodiazepine, anticonvulsant, and adrenergic medications, and for iron
      supplementation. In general, pharmacological treatment should be limited to
      individuals who meet diagnostic criteria and especially who experience insomnia
      and/or excessive sleepiness that is thought to occur secondary to RLS or PLMD.
      Individuals treated with medication should be followed by a physician and
      monitored for clinical response and adverse effects. It would be desirable for
      future investigations to employ multicenter clinical trials, with expanded
      numbers of subjects using double-blind, placebo-controlled designs, and an
      assessment of long-term response, side effects, and impact of treatment on
      quality of life. Evaluation of special groups such as children, pregnant women,
      and the elderly is warranted.

TI  - Neuroendocrine regulation and actions of leptin.
PG  - 317-63
AB  - The discovery of the adipocyte-produced hormone leptin has greatly changed the
      field of obesity research and our understanding of energy homeostasis. It is now 
      accepted that leptin is the afferent loop informing the hypothalamus about the
      state of fat stores, with hypothalamic efferents regulating appetite and energy
      expenditure. In addition, leptin has a role as a metabolic adaptator in
      overweight and fasting states. New and previously unsuspected neuroendocrine
      roles have emerged for leptin. In reproduction, leptin is implicated in fertility
      regulation, and it is a permissive factor for puberty. Relevant gender-based
      differences in leptin levels exist, with higher levels in women at birth, which
      persist throughout life. In adult life, there is experimental evidence that
      leptin is a permissive factor for the ovarian cycle, with a regulatory role
      exerted at the hypothalamic, pituitary, and gonadal levels, and with unexplained 
      changes in pregnancy and postpartum. Leptin is present in human milk and may play
      a role in the adaptive responses of the newborn. Leptin plays a role in the
      neuroendocrine control of GH secretion, through a complex interaction at
      hypothalamic levels with GHRH and somatostatin. Leptin participates in the
      expression of CRH in the hypothalamus, interacts at the adrenal level with ACTH, 
      and is regulated by glucocorticoids. Since leptin and cortisol show an inverse
      circadian rhythm, it has been suggested that a regulatory feedback is present.
      Finally, regulatory actions on TRH-TSH and PRL secretion have been found. Thus
      leptin reports the state of fat stores to the hypothalamus and other
      neuroendocrine areas, and the neuroendocrine systems adapt their function to the 
      current status of energy homeostasis and fat stores.

TI  - [Ethnic origin and care giving styles relevant to cot death].
PG  - 2141-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether ethnic origin is related to care giving styles
      relevant to sudden infant death. DESIGN: Prospective/retrospective, descriptive. 
      METHOD: In six child health care centres in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, data
      about sleep position, bedclothes and passive smoking of infants aged 1-5 months
      were collected by face-to-face interviews of mothers visiting these centres
      between February 1997 and October 1998. RESULTS: Eligible for the study were 1815
      infants, 919 boys and 896 girls, mean age 2 months. In Amsterdam 12.5% of infants
      were usually or sometimes put to sleep in a prone position, 31.0% usually or now 
      and then in a side position (but not in a prone position) and 56.5% usually in a 
      supine position. Prone sleeping position was more frequent among Surinamese
      infants and less frequent among Moroccan infants compared with Dutch infants.
      Overall use of a duvet among infants was 22.7%. Use of duvets was higher among
      allochtonous infants; after controlling for demographic factors this difference
      was not significant, however. 6.3% of the infants had slept in the previous night
      with a pillow. Use of a pillow was much more frequent among allochtonous than
      among autochtonous infants: 13% versus 1.2%. Maternal daily smoking during
      pregnancy and daily smoking by mothers or others at home at time of interview was
      found in 15.1% and 25.8% of the infants respectively. Almost no Moroccan mothers 
      smoked during pregnancy (0.4%), while Turkish mothers smoked as much as Dutch
      mothers (18.5% and 21.6% respectively). No differences in daily smoking at home
      were found between Surinamese, Moroccan and Dutch families (circa 26%). However, 
      daily smoking at home was much more frequent in Turkish families (43.8%).
      CONCLUSION: Health education about a safe sleeping position, about safe
      bedclothes and about the dangers of passive smoking is still needed. Education
      programmes to prevent sudden infant death must take into account ethnic
      differences in care giving styles. Special attention must be paid to the use of a
      pillow among allochtonous infants.

TI  - Why and how should adults lose weight?
PG  - 89-92
AB  - Being overweight increases the risk of developing many common diseases including 
      type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, gallstones and
      various cancers of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. It can also cause 
      or exacerbate osteoarthritis, breathlessness, heartburn, sleep apnoea, venous
      thromboembolism and psychological distress, particularly anxiety and depression. 
      It makes anaesthesia and surgery more hazardous, and in pregnancy increases the
      risks associated with childbirth. Being overweight can also complicate day-to-day
      social functioning such as negotiating seats on public transport or purchasing
      clothes. In this article, we review the evidence that weight loss is beneficial
      and how this might be achieved using lifestyle changes, drug therapy, or surgery.

TI  - Progress in reducing risky infant sleeping positions--13 states, 1996-1997.
PG  - 878-82
AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is one of the leading causes of postneonatal 
      mortality in the United States. To reduce the risk for SIDS, the American Academy
      of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all healthy babies be placed to sleep on
      their backs. In 1994, a national "Back-to-Sleep" education campaign was begun to 
      encourage health-care providers and the public to adopt a back or side sleeping
      position for all infants. To assess the response to these recommendations, CDC
      analyzed population-based data on infant sleeping positions during 1996 and 1997 
      from 13 states participating in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System
      (PRAMS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis and indicates that
      from 1996 to 1997 placement of infants in the stomach sleeping position declined 
      significantly in four states and placement of infants in the back sleeping
      position increased significantly in nine states. However, the percentage of
      infants placed on their stomachs continued to differ by state, maternal
      demographics, and type of insurance coverage.

TI  - The effect of betamethasone on fetal biophysical activities and Doppler
      velocimetry of umbilical and middle cerebral arteries.
PG  - 768-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preliminary reports suggest that antenatal steroid administration may 
      confound the assessment of fetal well-being by suppressing biophysical
      activities, consequently drug-induced effects could prompt unwarranted delivery
      of premature fetuses. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of
      antenatal betamethasone administration on fetal biophysical activities and
      Doppler flow indices of the umbilical and middle cerebral circulation. METHODS:
      Forty women at risk of premature delivery between 27-32 weeks gestation (mean
      30.2 weeks) received two consecutive doses of intramuscular betamethasone, 24
      hours apart. Ultrasonographic observations of fetal behavior for 30 minute
      periods and Doppler examination of the umbilical and cerebral arteries were
      performed prior to (0 hours), 48 hours after, and 96 hours after administration
      of the first dose. To account for fetal circadian rhythms and maternal prandial
      status, all examinations were carefully timed and performed between 1-4 pm.
      Analysis of Variance, chi-square test and Fisher's Exact test were used for
      statistical analysis, as appropriate. RESULTS: Nine patients were excluded from
      analysis due to delivery prior to completion of all examinations. Number of
      breathing episodes as well as total breathing time at 48 hours decreased by 83.0%
      (p<0.01) and 90.4% (p<0.01), respectively, at 48 hours in comparison to baseline.
      Fetal limb and trunk movements decreased by 53.2% (p<0.01) and 48.6% (p<0.01),
      respectively. Amniotic fluid volume and fetal tone were normal in all patients.
      At 48 hours, 14 of 31 fetuses and 4 of 31 fetuses had a biophysical profile score
      of 6/8 and 4/8, respectively, in comparison to 0 of 31 and 0 of 31 at 0 hours
      (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively). All parameters returned to baseline values at
      96 h. Pulsatility indices of umbilical and middle cerebral arteries remained
      unchanged at 48 hours and 96 hours (p=NS). CONCLUSIONS: Betamethasone induces a
      profound, albeit transient, suppression of fetal breathing, limb and trunk
      movements, resulting in decreased biophysical profile scores. Awareness of this
      drug-induced effect might prevent unnecessary iatrogenic delivery of preterm
      fetuses.

TI  - Maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 in a boy with a normal karyotype.
PG  - 782-5
AB  - We report on a boy with a maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14
      (UPD(14)). At 7 years of age he was referred to us by the paediatrician because
      of symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). He showed short stature, obesity,
      mild developmental delay, cryptorchidism, and some mild dysmorphic features. The 
      history further indicated intrauterine growth retardation at the end of the
      pregnancy. His mother was 44 years of age at the time of his birth. After birth
      he showed hypotonia with poor sucking, for which gavage feeding was needed. Motor
      development was delayed. After 1 year he became obese despite a normal appetite. 
      Recurrent middle ear infections, a high pain threshold, and a great skill with
      jigsaw puzzles were reported. There were no behavioural problems or sleep
      disturbance. Chromosomal analysis was normal (46,XY). DNA analysis for
      Prader-Willi syndrome showed no abnormalities. Two years later he was re-examined
      because we thought his features fitted the PWS-like phenotype associated with
      maternal UPD(14). At that time precocious puberty was evident. DNA analysis
      showed maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14. In all the previously described
      11 cases with maternal UPD(14), a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome
      14 was detected cytogenetically before DNA analysis. This is the first report of 
      diagnosis of maternal UPD(14) based on clinical features. This finding underlines
      the importance of DNA analysis for maternal UPD(14) in patients with a similar
      PWS-like phenotype even without previous identification of a Robertsonian
      translocation involving chromosome 14.

TI  - Cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults: clinical features and response to tricyclic
      antidepressants.
PG  - 2855-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) has been described infrequently in
      adults, and treatment in both children and adults remains unsatisfactory. We
      report clinical features of a group of adults with CVS and anecdotal outcome from
      open-label treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, medications that have some
      efficacy in other unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: Clinical data 
      were examined from 17 adult patients with CVS seen over a 10-yr period, each
      having been treated with a tricyclic antidepressant. Outpatient records were
      reviewed, clinical outcome was extracted using a priori criteria, and findings
      were compared with 37 patients having usual functional nausea and vomiting who
      also received tricyclic antidepressant therapy. RESULTS: Symptoms in CVS began at
      age 35 yr (range 14-73 yr); the average episode length was 6 days (range 1-21
      days) and the symptom-free interval averaged 3.1 months (range 0.5-6 months).
      Vomiting cycles typically began without warning, and fewer than one-third of the 
      subjects reported a prodrome or potential trigger event, such as menstrual
      periods, pregnancy, or large meals. Sleep was seemingly beneficial in 23.5%.
      Tricyclic antidepressant therapy was associated with complete remission in 17.6% 
      and partial response in 58.8%, but was less effective than for functional nausea 
      and vomiting (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: CVS is a rare diagnosis with distinctive
      features in adults. Duration of episodes and cycles varies considerably across
      subjects. In open-label, uncontrolled use, tricyclic antidepressants appear
      beneficial for some subjects but are less effective in CVS than in chronic,
      persistent functional nausea and vomiting.

PG  - 156-61
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The authors presented physiological conditions associated with
      increased prolactin values (sleep, stress, hypoglycemia, nipples stimulation,
      pregnancy and lactation) as well as the causes of pathological
      hyperprolactinemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The results of radioimmunoassay study
      have been analyzed in concern to the values of follicle-stimulating hormone
      (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin (PRL) obtained from the serum of
      100 women with increased PRL levels. The "HOECHT" sets were used for the
      analysis, whereas the values up to 20.9 microgrammes per litre were rated normal.
      The patients were distributed into 4 groups in concern to the level of PRL
      increase: 1st group--twenty (n = 20) patients with PRL values from 21-29.9
      micrograms/l, 90 blood samples analyzed; 2nd group-forty (n = 40) patients with
      PRL values f; 30-49.9 micrograms/l, 183 blood samples analyzed; 3rd group--twenty
      (n = 20) patients with PRL values from 50-99.9 micrograms/l, 83 blood samples
      analyzed; 4th group--twenty patients (n = 20) with PRL values more than 100
      micrograms/l, 78 blood samples analyzed. The values of FSH and LH recorded in the
      women with hyperprolactinemia were compared with mean values of the same hormones
      presented in IU/l from the follicular phase of the cycle in the control group
      which comprised 50 women of reproductive age having normal ovulatory menstrual
      cycle. RESULTS: The mean values of FSH and LH in the 1st group have not presented
      with statistically significant difference in relation to the control group.
      Prevalence of menstrual disorders was 30%, which was statistically significantly 
      higher than in general population. FSH values in the 2nd group were almost the
      same as in the control group whereas the values of LH were significantly higher. 
      The rate of polycistic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in this group has been significant, 
      also the increased rate of anovulatory cycles from 30 to 67.5%. A mild increase
      of menstrual cycle rhythm disorders, from 35 to 40% has been recorded. The values
      of FSH and LH in the 3rd group were significantly lower than in the control
      group. The significance level was higher for FSH (p < 0.01) then LH (p < 0.05).
      There was a sudden increase of the cycle rhythm disorders in this group reaching 
      90%. The 4th group presented with significantly lower values of FSH and LH in
      relation to the control group, whereas the cycle rhythm disorders occurred in all
      patients. DISCUSSION: The obtained results were compared with the literature data
      and some explanations given. CONCLUSIONS: The values of FSH an LH were
      statistically significantly lower in the 3rd and 4th group. The 2nd group was
      characteristic for the sudden increase of the number of anovulatory cycles from
      30 to 67.5%, whereas the 3rd group presented with the abrupt increase of
      menstrual cycle rhythm disorders, from 40 to 90%.

TI  - Epidemiology of SIDS and explained sudden infant deaths. CESDI SUDI Research
      Group.
PG  - e43
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To establish whether epidemiologic characteristics for sudden infant 
      death syndrome (SIDS) have changed since the decrease in death rate after the
      "Back to Sleep" campaign in 1991, and to compare these characteristics with
      sudden and unexpected deaths in infancy (SUDI) from explained causes. DESIGN:
      Three-year, population-based, case-control study. Parental interviews were
      conducted soon after the death and for 4 controls matched for age and date of
      interview. All sudden unexpected deaths were included in the study and the cause 
      of death was established by a multidisciplinary panel of the relevant health care
      professionals taking into account past medical and social history of the mother
      and infant, the circumstances of death, and a full pediatric postmortem
      examination. Contributory factors and the final classification of death were made
      using the Avon clinicopathologic system. SETTING: Five regions in England, with a
      total population of >17 million people, took part in the study. The number of
      live births within these regions during the particular time each region was
      involved in the study was 473 000. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred twenty-five 
      SIDS infants (91.3% of those available), 72 explained SUDI infants (86.7% of
      those available), and 1588 matched control infants (100% of total for cases
      included). RESULTS: Many of the epidemiologic features that characterize SIDS
      infants and families have remained the same, despite the recent decrease in SIDS 
      incidence in the United Kingdom. These include the same characteristic age
      distribution, few deaths in the first few weeks of life or after 6 months, with a
      peak between 4 and 16 weeks, a higher incidence in males, lower birth weight,
      shorter gestation, and more neonatal problems at delivery. As in previous studies
      there was a strong correlation with young maternal age and higher parity and the 
      risk increased for infants of single mothers and for multiple births. A small but
      significant proportion of index mothers had also experienced a previous
      stillbirth or infant death. The majority of the SIDS deaths (83%) occurred during
      the night sleep and there was no particular day of the week on which a
      significantly higher proportion of deaths occurred. Major epidemiologic features 
      to change since the decrease in SIDS rate include a reduction in the previous
      high winter peaks of death and a shift of SIDS families to the more deprived
      social grouping. Just more than one quarter of the SIDS deaths (27%) occurred in 
      the 3 winter months (December through February) in the 3 years of this study. In 
      half of the SIDS families (49%), the lone parent or both parents were unemployed 
      compared with less than a fifth of control families (18%). This difference was
      not explained by an excess of single mothers in the index group. Many of the
      significant factors relating to the SIDS infants and families that distinguish
      them from the normal population did not distinguish between SIDS and explained
      SUDI. In the univariate analysis many of the epidemiologic characteristics
      significant among the SIDS group were also identified and in the same direction
      among the infants dying as SUDI attributable to known causes. The explained
      deaths were similarly characterized by the same infant, maternal, and social
      factors, 48% of these families received no waged income. Using logistic
      regression to make a direct comparison between the two index groups there were
      only three significant differences between the two groups of deaths: 1) a
      different age distribution, the age distribution of the explained deaths peaked
      in the first 2 months and was more uniform thereafter; 2) more congenital
      anomalies were noted at birth (odds ratio [OR] = 3.14; 95% confidence intervals
      [CI]: 1.52-6. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

TI  - Memory in pregnancy. II: Implicit, incidental, explicit, semantic, short-term,
      working and prospective memory in primigravid, multigravid and postpartum women.
PG  - 158-64
AB  - This study, using an information processing model of memory, made a detailed
      examination of the possible locus (loci) of any memory change in gravid and
      postpartum women using a battery of seven objective memory tests: implicit,
      incidental, explicit, semantic, short-term, working, and prospective memory. In
      addition, links were sought both between (a) self-reported data on sleep, health,
      and memory performance, and (b) these variables and objective memory performance.
      Five groups of women were tested (n = 22/23 per group), (1) primigravid, (2)
      multigravid, (3) postpartum, (4) non-pregnant parents with children, and (5)
      never been pregnant, on self-report and objective memory tests. The gravid and
      postpartum groups reported significantly more everyday forgetting than the
      non-pregnant groups but on the objective tests performed no differently from the 
      non-pregnant groups on all tests. Sleep loss was a significant predictor of
      reported memory change, but not of any memory test performance, and may
      contribute to a perceived memory change. Pregnant women and new mothers generally
      should be confident of performing to their normal cognitive capabilities, but may
      be more affected than usual by a high cognitive load.

TI  - Water fluoridation and the sudden infant death syndrome.
PG  - 286-9
AB  - AIMS: To determine whether exposure to fluoridated water supplies prenatally or
      postnatally at the time of death increases the risk of sudden infant death
      syndrome (SIDS). METHODS: A nationwide, case-control study, with infant's water
      fluoridation status determined from census area unit information for mother's
      usual address at the time of the infant's birth, infant's usual address at the
      time of death / nominated sleep and address where infant died / was at nominated 
      sleep. SIDS risk associated with fluoride exposure postnatally was assessed
      according to method of infant feeding (breast or reconstituted formula), for the 
      two days prior to infant's death / nominated sleep. RESULTS: Infants exposed to
      fluoridated water supplies during pregnancy were not at increased risk for SIDS, 
      adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82, 1.74). For
      breast-fed infants at the time of death / nominated sleep, fluoridated water
      exposure was not associated with an increased risk for SIDS, adjusted OR 1.09
      (95% CI 0.66, 1.79). Similarly, 'fluoridated' formula feeding, when compared with
      'unfluoridated' formula feeding, showed no increased risk of SIDS, adjusted OR
      1.25 (95% CI 0.73, 2.13). There was no evidence of an interaction between
      fluoridation and infant feeding for the last two days (chi2 = 0.171, df = 1, p = 
      0.68). CONCLUSION: Exposure to a fluoridated water supply prenatally or
      postnatally at the time of death did not affect the relative risk for SIDS.

TI  - Maturation of spontaneous and agonist-induced uterine contractions in the
      peripartum mouse uterus.
PG  - 873-8
AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that the uterus achieves maximum contractile
      capabilities before the onset of labor. Basal and agonist-stimulated contractions
      were assessed in uterine strips on Day 15 or 18 of pregnancy, the day of
      parturition, or 1 day postpartum (n = 4-13 per group). Spontaneous contractions
      were evident in all groups (n = 4-13 per gestational group); contraction
      frequency was greater in peripartum groups than in virgin controls (
      approximately 4.6 versus 2.8/200 sec). Peak amplitude was nearly 9-fold higher on
      Days 15 and 18 and over 30-fold higher in the postpartum and 1 day postpartum
      groups than in nonpregnant mice. Maximum frequency and peak amplitude were
      achieved in response to 10(-6) to 10(-8) M oxytocin or arginine vasopressin
      (OT(max) or AVP(max)). Frequency of contractions in response to OT(max) peaked on
      Day 18 and then declined. Contraction amplitude increased 5-fold on Day 15,
      declined on the day of birth (equivalent to nonpregnant level), then rebounded to
      peak on postpartum Day 1. AVP(max) similarly increased frequency and amplitude of
      contractions, except that maximum contraction amplitude occurred postpartum.
      Thus, an endogenous oscillator, residing in the uterus, sustains high basal and
      agonist-induced contraction frequency during pregnancy. Although acceleration of 
      this pacemaker occurred before term, the data suggest that peripartum increases
      in contraction amplitude characterize the transition to the powerful synchronous 
      contractions of parturition.

TI  - The ontogeny of the small intestinal epithelium.
PG  - S3-6
AB  - The primary factors in feeding premature infants are dependent on the development
      and maturation of digestion and absorption. The maturation of digestive and
      absorptive functions of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins in 
      the young premature infant were determined in relation to availability of
      hydrolytic enzymes, such as lipases, proteases, amylases, glucosidases, and
      lactase. The feeding is dependent on the ability of the premature infant to
      secrete salivary enzymes, gastric acid, pepsin, pancreatic exocrine enzymes, the 
      presence of enterohepatic circulation, and the hydrolytic and absorptive capacity
      of the entercocyte. To evaluate the complexity of the gut maturation process, we 
      proposed a unified concept where the ontogeny of the gastrointestinal system is
      the result of the following four major determinants: genetic endowment, intrinsic
      developmental and biological clock, endogenous regulatory mechanisms, and
      environmental influences. The developmental clock represents a predetermined
      temporal sequence of happenings in ontogeny that is inherently controlled. By 20 
      weeks of gestation, the anatomic differentiation of the fetal gut has progressed 
      to the extent that it resembles that of a newborn. Secretory and absorptive
      functions, however, develop at different rates; the intestinal absorptive process
      is only partially available before 26 weeks of gestation, whereas gastric and
      pancreatic secretion is only basal and can be stimulated only partially even in
      the full-term newborn period. Regulatory mechanisms control the expression of the
      genetic endowment at various stages in gastrointestinal development.
      Neural-hormonal factors play major roles in the ontogeny of the gut.
      Adrenalectomy, hypophysectomy, and thyroidectomy delay the development of the
      gut. Administration of glucocorticoids or thyroxine at the critical stage in
      maturation causes early appearance of enzymes within the intestine. Other
      hormones that are potentially important in regulating gastrointestinal
      development include cholecystokinin, gastrin, secretin, which have trophic
      effects on the gastrointestinal tract, and insulin, insulin-like growth factors, 
      and epidermial growth factor. The development of gastrointestinal secretory
      function, particularly in response to hormonal stimulation, has received
      considerable attention. The degree of response of the target cell is determined
      not only by the amount of effective hormone reaching it but also by the number
      and affinity of receptors on its surface. Human newborns have high levels of
      gastrin in their sera, yet have low acid output. Exogenous gastrin is an
      ineffective stimulant despite the presence of seemingly "anatomically developed" 
      parietal cells. It seems that neither endogenous nor exogenous gastrin has an
      effect on the target cell. If one accepts the role of circulating gastrin levels 
      in the regulation of its own receptor, one can hypothesize the absence of a
      regulatory effect of gastrin in the newborn period. It was shown that hormonal
      regulation of migrating activity by motilin is also absent in the preterm and
      term infant. Plasma levels of motilin in neonates are comparable to those found
      in adults, but migrating motor complexes occur in the absence of cycling of
      plasma concentrations. Interestingly, however, the motilin receptor appears to be
      present. In conclusion, the feeding mode content, concentration, and volume of
      the very young premature infant can be assessed by the development of digestive
      and absorptive capacity and gut motility. The concomitant changes in gut hormones
      and regulatory peptides during ontogeny and feeding will add a new dimension in
      the understanding of when, what, and how to feed the very young premature infant.

TI  - Maternal and developmental toxicity evaluation of melatonin administered orally
      to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats.
PG  - 271-9
AB  - Melatonin (MEL) is a widely used, over-the-counter sleep aid, and it has putative
      contraceptive, antioxidant, antiaging, and anticancer effects. The developmental 
      toxicity potential for repeated oral doses of MEL had not previously been
      evaluated. In the present studies, time-mated, Sprague-Dawley-derived (CD) rats
      were administered MEL or vehicle by gavage on gestation days (gd) 6-19.
      MEL-treated groups received 1-, 10-, 100-, 150-, or 200-mg/kg body weight/day in 
      the screening study (15 rats/group), and 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day in the
      definitive study (25 rats/group). In both studies, maternal food/water
      consumption, body weight, and clinical signs were monitored at regular intervals 
      throughout gestation. At termination (gd 20, both studies), maternal liver and
      gravid uterine weights, number of ovarian corpora lutea, conceptus survival,
      fetal sex, and fetal body weight were evaluated. Fetal morphological examination 
      included external structures (both studies) as well as visceral and skeletal
      structures (definitive study). In the screening study, maternal serum levels of
      17beta-estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and luteinizing hormone were
      determined by radioimmunoassay, and mammary tissue was fixed, stained, and
      evaluated for percent glandular area within the fat pad. No maternal
      morbidity/mortality was found in either study. In the screening study, aversion
      to treatment (> or =100 mg/kg/day) and reduced maternal weight gain (> or =150
      mg/kg/day) were noted, but reproductive/endocrine parameters and fetal
      development were not affected. In the definitive study, aversion to treatment was
      noted at > or =50 mg/kg/day, and mild sedation, reduced maternal food intake, and
      reduced body weight gain were found during initial treatment with 200 mg/kg/day. 
      MEL had no effect on prenatal survival, fetal body weight, or incidences of fetal
      malformations/variations. Thus, in the definitive study, the maternal toxicity
      NOAEL and LOAEL were 100 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively, and the developmental
      toxicity NOAEL was > or =200 mg/kg/day.

TI  - Epidemiology of intrathoracic petechial hemorrhages in sudden infant death
      syndrome.
PG  - 200-9
AB  - The possible effects of a wide range of sociodemographic and environmental
      factors on the incidence and distribution of petechiae were investigated in 485
      sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases from the New Zealand Cot Death Study.
      The number (nil, few, many) of macroscopic petechial hemorrhages in the visceral 
      pleura, capsule of thymus, and epicardium was recorded in 458 of 474 autopsied
      SIDS cases. Other information was obtained from parental interview and obstetric 
      records. Univariate analysis showed highly significant relationships (P < or =
      0.005) between the frequency of petechiae at one or more sites and socioeconomic 
      status, parity, breast feeding, age at death, time of death, sleep position, and 
      head covering at death and lesser but significant relationships (P < or = 0.05)
      with Maori ethnicity, birth weight, gestation, pacifier use, and bed sharing.
      After multivariate analysis, significant associations remained between increased 
      frequencies of thymic petechiae and parity (P = 0.0001), age at death (P =
      0.0003), Maori ethnicity (P = 0.0019), pacifier use (P = 0.0001), and head
      covering at death (P = 0.0032); between increased frequencies of epicardial
      petechiae and head covering at death (P = 0.008) and an estimated time of death
      between 00:00 and 05:59 h (P = 0.056); and between increased frequencies of
      pleural petechiae and maternal smoking (P = 0.058) and parity (P = 0.022). There 
      was a decreased frequency of pleural petechiae in infants placed prone for their 
      final sleep (P = 0.058). The distribution and frequency of petechiae are affected
      by environmental factors, including known risk factors for SIDS, but these
      factors occur inconsistently across the three sites. The findings imply
      differences in the pathogenesis at each site but do not provide consistent
      support for previous theories of causation of petechiae.

TI  - Changes in sleep-wake cycle during the period from late pregnancy to puerperium
      identified through the wrist actigraph and sleep logs.
PG  - 133-5
AB  - The purpose of this study was to understand the sleep-wake cycle during the
      period from late pregnancy to about 3 months of postpartum by evaluating the
      number of actigraphic activities in four women (one multipara and three primi
      gravidae), and to compare the results with the findings from sleep logs. An
      irregularity of the sleep-wake cycle with increased number of wakings at night
      was notable during about 1 month after delivery, compared to the late pregnancy
      period, and subsequently this number tended to decrease. These results were
      indicative of the association between the lactation cycle to neonates and the
      sleep-wake cycle.

TI  - Effects of prolactin on sleep in cyclic rats.
PG  - 101-3
AB  - We previously demonstrated that pregnancy-associated sleep enhancement is
      correlated with the daily surges of prolactin (PRL). However, in spite of a surge
      of PRL in the proestrous night, a reduction of nocturnal sleep occurs in phase
      with proestrus. Therefore, to clarify the physiological role of PRL in sleep
      regulation during the estrous cycle, time-course changes in sleep were analyzed
      in bromocriptine (CB-154)-treated and/or PRL-supplemented female rats. Sleep
      patterns characteristic of proestrus-to-estrus were not affected by the CB-154
      treatment. In contrast, nocturnal rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) was
      significantly increased after the PRL supplementation. The CB-154 treatment
      diminished the REMS-enhancing effect of PRL. Thus, the results suggest that the
      endogenous PRL is not crucial for the regulation of sleep during the estrous
      cycle, while exogenous PRL can enhance REMS.

TI  - Shift work, health, the working time regulations and health assessments.
PG  - 127-37
AB  - Shift work and night work in particular have been associated with sleep
      difficulties, general malaise, fatigue, peptic ulceration, ischaemic heart
      disease, cigarette smoking and adverse pregnancy outcome. The medical conditions 
      previously regarded as making individuals unsuitable for shift work show wide
      ranging patho-physiological activity and there is no published evidence for any
      such condition to be regarded an absolute reason to exclude an individual from
      shift work. The fulfilment of the legal obligations of the Working Time
      Regulations 1998 is neither prescribed nor constrained in any way. It is
      advisable therefore to build on existing health procedures where they are in
      effect. Periodic health questionnaires can offer health professionals an
      opportunity to detect any disorder likely to be aggravated by shift work or by a 
      combination of shift work, job demands and workplace conditions. A further
      purpose of the questionnaire is the assessment of ability to undertake shift work
      duties. However, health questionnaires are neither sensitive nor specific enough 
      to be used to select applicants or employees for shift work, since they do not
      consistently predict tolerance of shift work or subsequent health problems.
      Whether employers should offer anything more than a simple questionnaire will
      depend on the culture of the company and accessibility of health services.
      Screening programmes affect many people relative to the few who benefit and with 
      existing knowledge, periodic general health examinations performed in
      asymptomatic subjects have limited predictive or preventive value.

TI  - Prenatal stress alters circadian activity of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis
      and hippocampal corticosteroid receptors in adult rats of both gender.
PG  - 302-15
AB  - Prenatal stress impairs activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
      in response to stress in adult offspring. So far, very few data are available on 
      the effects of prenatal stress on circadian functioning of the HPA axis. Here, we
      studied the effects of prenatal stress on the circadian rhythm of corticosterone 
      secretion in male and female adult rats. To evaluate the effects of prenatal
      stress on various regulatory components of corticosterone secretion, we also
      assessed the diurnal fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin, total and free
      corticosterone levels, and hippocampal corticosteroid receptors. Finally, in the 
      search of possible maternal factors, we studied the effects of repeated restraint
      stress on the pattern of corticosterone secretion in pregnant female rats.
      Results demonstrate that prenatal stress induced higher levels of total and free 
      corticosterone secretion at the end of the light period in both males and
      females, and hypercorticism over the entire diurnal cycle in females. No diurnal 
      fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin was observed in any group studied. The effects
      of prenatal stress on corticosterone secretion could be mediated, at least in
      part, by a reduction in corticosteroid receptors at specific times of day.
      Results also show that prepartal stress alters the pattern of corticosterone
      secretion in pregnant females. Those data indicate that prenatally stressed rats 
      exhibit an altered temporal functioning of the HPA axis, which, taken together
      with their abnormal response to stress, reinforces the idea of a general
      homeostatic dysfunction in those animals.

TI  - Memory in pregnancy. I: Subjective experiences and objective assessment of
      implicit, explicit and working memory in primigravid and primiparous women.
PG  - 80-7
AB  - This study investigated the belief held by over 50% of parous women that they are
      more forgetful during pregnancy and postpartum relative to other times.
      Comparisons were made between both the reported and objective memory performances
      of three groups of women (n = 20 per group), (1) primigravid, (2) primiparous
      (baby younger than 12 months), and (3) never been pregnant, matched on age and
      education levels. Participants completed a questionnaire on demographic, health, 
      and sleep details, the Inventory of Memory Experiences, and tests of implicit,
      explicit, and working memory. The groups did not differ on self-rated levels of
      physical or emotional health, or anxiety level. The primigravid and primiparous
      groups reported overall poorer memory performance since pregnancy relative to
      controls. The primigravid group also reported significantly more sleep
      disruption, with this being a significant predictor of reported memory change. On
      the objective tests, there were no differences between groups on the implicit and
      explicit memory tests, but the primigravid and primiparous groups scored
      significantly lower on a test of working memory. Self-reports of memory change
      during pregnancy and postpartum may be related to life changes, such as sleep
      change, and may reflect changed perceptions rather than objective changes.

PG  - 127-36
AB  - Changes in prenatal care practices resulted from a pilot study with 12 urban New 
      Mexican women who received no prenatal care. The women were interviewed regarding
      their reasons for not receiving care during pregnancy, health behaviors, and
      perceived neonatal outcomes. Data on actual neonatal outcomes were taken from the
      medical record. Maternal reasons for no prenatal care were socio-demographic,
      system-related, attitudinal, and outside forces of job and childcare. To ensure a
      healthy baby, the women made changes in their nutrition, self-care activities,
      substance use, sleep, and exercise activities. All of the women perceived they
      had a healthy baby. Yet 61% of the neonates had complications and 45% were low
      birth weight. The research findings were used to develop a care management
      program that included case management and utilization management.

TI  - Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoking is associated with a decrease in arousal
      in infants.
PG  - 34-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sudden infant death syndrome has been related to both exposure to
      prenatal cigarette smoke and impaired arousability from sleep. We evaluated
      whether healthy infants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy had higher
      auditory arousal thresholds than those born to mothers who did not smoke and
      whether the effects of smoking occurred before birth. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-six
      newborns were studied with polygraphic recordings for 1 night: 13 were born to
      mothers who did not smoke, and 13 were born to mothers who smoked (>9 cigarettes 
      per day). Other infants with a median postnatal age of 12 weeks were also
      studied, 21 born to nonsmoking mothers and 21 born to smoking mothers. White
      noise of increasing intensity was administered during rapid eye movement sleep to
      evaluate arousal and awakening thresholds. RESULTS: More intense auditory stimuli
      were needed to induce arousals in newborns (P =.002) and infants (P =. 044) of
      smokers than in infants of nonsmokers. Behavioral awakening occurred
      significantly less frequently in the newborns of smokers (P =.002) than of
      nonsmokers. CONCLUSIONS: Newborns and infants born to smoking mothers had higher 
      arousal thresholds to auditory challenges than those born to nonsmoking mothers. 
      The impact of exposure to cigarette smoke occurred before birth.

TI  - [Leg cramps in pregnancy--how common are they?].
PG  - 1589-90
AB  - Leg cramps in pregnancy, defined as painful spasms of the calf, were investigated
      among women giving birth at the maternity ward at Baerum Hospital from 1 October 
      to 20 October 1997. A questionnaire distributed to 120 women three days after
      parturition revealed that 45% had suffered from leg cramps during pregnancy.
      Among 54% of them the cramps appeared after the 25th week of pregnancy. 76% of
      the women had experienced the symptoms twice per week or less often; 81% of them 
      suffered from painful cramps only during night-time. We conclude that leg cramps 
      are still a common symptom in pregnancy and may compromize sleep and hence the
      ability to work.

TI  - The effect of betamethasone and dexamethasone on fetal heart rate patterns and
      biophysical activities. A prospective randomized trial.
PG  - 493-500
AB  - UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND; Contradictory findings on the effect of betamethasone
      versus dexamethasone on antenatal tests of fetal well-being have been reported.
      The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of these steroid compounds
      on fetal heart rate patterns and biophysical activities in a prospective.
      randomized trial. STUDY DESIGN: Forty-six pregnant women (gestational age range
      27-34 weeks) at risk for preterm delivery were randomized to receive
      betamethasone or dexamethasone for enhancement of fetal lung maturity. Fetal
      heart rate was recorded for 60 minutes and analyzed with the Sonicaid System 8000
      before (0 hours), and 48 hours and 96 hours after steroid administration.
      Subsequently, fetal limb, body and breathing movements were sonographically
      observed and quantified for 30 minutes. To account for fetal circadian rhythms,
      all examinations were performed between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., at least one hour
      after maternal meals. RESULTS: Fetal heart rate accelerations (p<0.001; p<0.01), 
      short-term variation (p<0.0001; p<0.05), long-term variation (p<0.01; p=NS),
      duration of high episodes (p<0.001; p<0.05), total movement count (p<0.001;
      p<0.05), and duration of breathing time (p<0.0001; p<0.0001) were substantially
      reduced 48 h after betamethasone and dexamethasone administration, respectively, 
      with percent reduction being larger for the betamethasone group, except for
      breathing movements (p<0.05; p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.005; p<0.05; p=NS;
      respectively). In 68.2%( and 45.5% of fetuses, less than 30 seconds of continuous
      breathing movements were found in the betamethasone and dexamethasone groups,
      respectively. In 71.8% and 12.5%, of fetuses, respectively, less than 2 body/limb
      movements were observed. Therefore five and two fetuses in the betamethasone and 
      dexamethasone study group, respectively, had both nonreactive fetal heart rate
      monitors for 60 minutes and biophysical profiles of < or =4/10. All parameters
      returned to baseline values at 96 h. Baseline fetal heart rate and numbers of
      decelerations remained unchanged (p=NS). CONCLUSIONS: Both betamethasone and
      dexamethasone induce a profound, albeit transient, suppression of fetal heart
      rate characteristics and biophysical activities in the preterm fetus. However,
      the effect of betamethasone is more pronounced. Awareness of these phenomena
      might prevent unwarranted iatrogenic delivery of preterm fetuses.

TI  - Benign epileptic discharges in patients with lesional partial epilepsies.
PG  - 354-9
AB  - Case reports of four patients with therapy-resistant lesional partial epilepsies 
      and additional foci of benign epileptic discharges of childhood, in addition to
      the usual electroencephalogram (EEG) changes, are presented. A family history of 
      epileptic or febrile seizures in childhood was reported in all four patients. A
      distant relative of one patient, not manifesting seizures, demonstrated rolandic 
      spikes on EEG. An abnormal pregnancy (polyhydramnion, premature pains, induced
      labor because of an abnormal CTG , placenta insufficiency) was reported in one
      patient, risk factors during birth (birth 14 days after term, placenta
      insufficiency) were reported in one, and bacterial meningitis at 4 weeks of age
      was reported in one. All patients manifested a retarded, partly severe,
      unfavorable infantile psychomotor development. An early seizure onset was
      observed in all patients (in three patients during the first year of life and in 
      one patient during the second year). A hemifacial seizure symptomatology was
      seen, in addition to other symptoms, in two patients, possibly indicating the
      seizure pattern indicative of benign partial seizures; seizures occurred
      exclusively in sleep in one patient. The benign focus was never located in the
      lesional area. It was recorded over the same hemisphere in two patients and over 
      the other hemisphere in the other two.

TI  - Aetiological factors and development in subjects with obstructive sleep apnoea.
PG  - 140-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether maternal pregnancy complications, adverse birth
      events, respiratory illnesses, or developmental difficulty were increased in
      neurologically normal children with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and whether
      severity of OSA adversely affects the child's development and temperament.
      METHODOLOGY: Maternal report of perinatal events, respiratory illness and
      developmental difficulty in 37 children with OSA was contrasted with a comparison
      group (n = 67). Children with OSA were assessed developmentally (Griffiths
      Scales), had a parental rating of temperament (Australian Temperament Scale) and 
      attended an overnight polysomnographic sleep study. RESULTS: Children with OSA
      had an increased prevalence of adverse maternal pregnancy and perinatal events,
      respiratory disease and developmental concerns. Limited associations were found
      between the severity of OSA and development or temperament difficulty.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a relationship between OSA, though not its
      severity, and pre/perinatal adversity and child development. Polysomnographic and
      detailed developmental assessment of community-based samples of children with OSA
      and control children are necessary to confirm these findings.

TI  - Blood pressure and heart rate rhythmicity: differential effects of late
      pregnancy.
PG  - 269-75
AB  - Arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) of 31 hospitalized pregnant
      women at low risk of hypertension were automatically monitored for 48 h at 15-min
      intervals. Each of the recorded 56 data series for systolic arterial pressure
      (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), and HR was chronobiologically assessed 
      by linear-nonlinear rhythmometry. The rhythm-adjusted mean (MESOR), circadian
      amplitude, circadian acrophase, and best-fitting period were grouped by pregnancy
      trimester and further subjected to analysis of variance. BP MESOR remained
      unaltered, whereas HR MESOR increased significantly in middle and late pregnancy.
      Ultradian rhythms, with an amplitude higher than that of the circadian rhythm,
      were found in 25% of the SAP records in the second and third trimester. Such
      ultradian rhythms were not detected in the simultaneously recorded HR. Finally,
      the group BP and HR circadian acrophases coincided in the first trimester, but
      were significantly apart in mid and late pregnancy. These observations support
      the notion that the coordination of BP and HR rhythmicity involves different
      physiological mechanisms. Analysis of the individual variability in the
      chronobiological end points (based on the records of nine women monitored in each
      pregnancy trimester) revealed that only the BP MESOR was well reproducible in the
      course of pregnancy and may be useful in early diagnosis of gestational
      hypertension.

AB  - Twenty-six pregnant women were assigned to a massage therapy or a relaxation
      therapy group for 5 weeks. The therapies consisted of 20-min sessions twice a
      week. Both groups reported feeling less anxious after the first session and less 
      leg pain after the first and last session. Only the massage therapy group,
      however, reported reduced anxiety, improved mood, better sleep and less back pain
      by the last day of the study. In addition, urinary stress hormone levels
      (norepinephrine) decreased for the massage therapy group and the women had fewer 
      complications during labor and their infants had fewer postnatal complications
      (e.g., less prematurity).

TI  - An unusual cause of obstructive sleep apnoea presenting during pregnancy.
PG  - 1189-91
AB  - We describe a case of lingual thyroid (LT) with primary hypothyroidism,
      presenting during pregnancy and continuing beyond it with oropharyngeal
      obstructive symptoms and sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) of mixed type. Although SAS 
      of a combined obstructive and central type should not be too surprising in a case
      of LT with hypothyroidism, we were unable to find such a documentation
      previously. Only four weeks of L-thyroxin treatment resulted in a dramatic
      improvement in dysphagia, disturbed phonation, haemoptysis, arterial
      desaturation, sleep apnoea and overall sleep efficiency, in conjunction with a
      regression in the size of the lingual mass. This case highlights the vagaries
      confronted in the management of such a case and focuses on efforts towards
      accurate diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Behavioral state affects heart rate response to low-intensity sound in human
      fetuses.
PG  - 39-54
AB  - The cardiac orienting reflex is elicited by a low-intensity sound, it consists of
      a sustained heart rate (HR) deceleration, and it is a specific physiological
      correlate of cognitive processing. In this study we examined the relationship
      between behavioral state and the cardiac orienting reflex in 75 human fetuses
      between 36 and 40 weeks gestation. Each fetus was stimulated with a 30-s speech
      sound at an average intensity of 83 dB SPL in quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep
      (AS). The fetal cardiac electrical signal was captured transabdominally at a rate
      of 1024 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal processing.
      Fetal behavioral states were assigned based on HR pattern and the presence or
      absence of eye and general body movements. We found that a significant HR
      deceleration occurred, in both QS and AS, following stimulus onset. However, HR
      decelerations occurred more often in QS than AS; and for fetuses exhibiting a HR 
      deceleration, the magnitude of the deceleration was greater in AS compared to QS.
      In addition, in AS female fetuses exhibited a larger, more sustained HR
      deceleratory response than male fetuses, but the seconds x gender interaction in 
      QS was not significant. Based on these results, we concluded that behavioral
      state is an important determinant of the HR deceleratory response in human
      fetuses.

TI  - Reduced mRNA expression of neuropeptide Y in the limbic system of tenascin gene
      disrupted mouse brain.
PG  - 265-8
AB  - Tenascin-C (TN), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein which reveals both neurite 
      outgrowth-promoting and growth-inhibiting effects, is generated in the central
      nervous system. A previous study reported that TN-gene null mutant mice display
      hyperlocomotion and do not easily habituate to unfamiliar environments.
      Additionally, these mice display poor appetite, abnormal circadian rhythm and low
      pregnancy rate. The present study demonstrated that neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA
      expression is reduced in the limbic area of the TN gene-deficient mouse brain as 
      compared to wild-type mice. NPY has been shown to affect emotion, circadian
      rhythm and food intake, and the present results suggest that the some behavioural
      abnormalities exhibited by TN-mutant mice may be in part due to the low level of 
      expression of NPY mRNA in the limbic system.

TI  - Longitudinal changes in fatigue and energy during pregnancy and the postpartum
      period.
PG  - 183-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe perceived levels of fatigue and energy before, during, and
      after pregnancy in a group of healthy women experiencing uncomplicated
      pregnancies; and to examine relationships between their perception of fatigue and
      energy, parity, and physiologic indicators of sleep disturbances, thyroid
      function, and iron deficiency. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal. SETTING:
      Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 24 primiparous and 1 8
      multiparous women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in fatigue and energy over time.
      Measures were obtained at follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle
      before pregnancy, at each trimester, and at 1 and 3 months after delivery.
      RESULTS: Younger age and lower prepregnancy levels of iron, ferritin, and
      hemoglobin explained 1st trimester fatigue. Less total sleep was related to
      fatigue in the 3rd trimester. Postpartum fatigue was related to reduced amounts
      of sleep and low levels of ferritin and hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: With the
      exception of premenstrual (luteal) fatigue, progesterone levels were unrelated to
      fatigue. Neither paid employment nor family variables influenced perception of
      fatigue. Nurses working with childbearing populations should counsel women about 
      significant 1st trimester fatigue so they can prepare their work and home
      environments in an attempt to achieve adequate rest.

TI  - Effects of discontinuing coffee intake on iron deficient Guatemalan toddlers'
      cognitive development and sleep.
PG  - 251-69
AB  - Coffee is commonly given daily to toddlers in Guatemala. Possible negative
      effects of coffee ingestion on cognitive development and sleep patterns were
      assessed in 132 children 12-24 months of age who had received coffee for > 2
      months and were iron deficient on at least one indicator. Children were
      stratified by initial hemoglobin (A= anemic, Hgb < 10.5 g/dl; NA = 'non-anemic', 
      Hgb > or = 10.5 g/dl) and were randomly assigned to an experimental group (S =
      substitute consisting of sugar and coloring), and a control group (C =
      continuation of coffee) (42 C-NA; 53 S-NA; 18 C-A; and 19 S-A). Anemic children
      were provided Fe supplements for 2-3 months. Compliance was assessed every 2
      weeks. After 5 months, testers masked to treatment group and anemia evaluated
      children with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II in a central location.
      Scores were the Mental Development Index (MDI), the Psychomotor Development Index
      (PDI), and scales from the Behavior Rating Scale (BRS). The child's sleep in the 
      previous 24 h was assessed with a set of standardized sleep questions to the care
      giver on the first visit and every 2 weeks thereafter. No significant effects of 
      treatment on test scores or BRS ratings were found. In the 24 h period reported
      on at the final visit, children in the Substitute group slept more during the
      night and overall (night plus naps) than children in the Coffee group, a
      difference not found at the first visit. No differences were found in sleep
      difficulty or number of times waking at night. Women's reported coffee intake per
      day during pregnancy was associated with lower BRS ratings, even after
      controlling for SES and child age. The effects of postnatal coffee ingestion in
      Guatemala were seen for sleep duration, but not for cognitive development.
      Prenatal coffee ingestion was negatively associated with Behavior Rating Scales
      and should be investigated further.

TI  - Cholinergic receptors in heart and brainstem of rats exposed to nicotine during
      development: implications for hypoxia tolerance and perinatal mortality.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - Cigarette smoking during pregnancy increases the incidence of perinatal mortality
      and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). We have evaluated prenatal or postnatal 
      nicotine exposure in developing rats to examine the potential role of altered
      neurotransmitter receptor expression in these processes. Pregnant rats received
      continuous infusions of nicotine throughout gestation, at doses mimicking the
      plasma levels found in smokers. After birth, cardiac M2-muscarinic cholinergic
      receptors, which are responsible for inhibitory autonomic actions, were enhanced 
      in the nicotine group, coincidentally with decreases in stimulatory
      beta-adrenergic receptors that have been demonstrated previously. Studies of
      adenylyl cyclase activity confirmed that the changes in receptor binding
      represented functional alterations: the stimulatory response to isoproterenol was
      obtunded by prenatal nicotine exposure, whereas the inhibitory response to
      carbachol was enhanced. Elevations of M2-muscarinic receptor binding were not
      generalized to all tissues, as the same prenatal nicotine treatment elicited a
      reduction in these receptors in the brainstem, an effect that has also been noted
      in infants who died of SIDS; we found no effects of prenatal nicotine on
      brainstem M1-receptor binding. Postnatal administration of nicotine produced
      similar brainstem receptor effects when treatment was conducted during the first 
      postnatal week but not thereafter; postnatal nicotine treatment did not affect
      cardiac M2-receptor binding. Thus, during a critical developmental period,
      nicotine exposure produces cardiac and brainstem receptor imbalances that favor
      inhibitory responses, effects that can contribute to morbidity and mortality
      evoked by hypoxic episodes, such as those experienced during parturition, sleep
      apnea or airway obstruction.

TI  - Grief, depression, and coping in women undergoing infertility treatment.
PG  - 245-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the levels of grief and depression and the coping
      mechanisms of women with infertility problems who participated in in vitro
      fertilization (IVF) or ovulation-induction medication. METHODS: Pretest and
      post-test data were obtained from 50 IVF and 50 ovulation-induction medication
      patients receiving treatment at two urban infertility centers. RESULTS: Both
      groups of women experienced measurable levels of grief and depression before,
      during, and after treatment. Higher scores on the Grief Experience Inventory were
      found for both groups of women when pregnancy did not occur. Age, reproductive
      problems, years infertile, financial impact, and number of past IVF cycles were
      not found to influence the reported grief or depression levels. Women in the IVF 
      and ovulation-induction medication groups used isolation coping behaviors such as
      self-talk and sleep. CONCLUSION: Because of moderate to high levels of grief and 
      depression, therapeutic counseling may be more effective if initiated before the 
      infertility treatment. Women's present levels of distress and coping strategies
      should be assessed prior to initiating infertility treatment to provide the
      patients with opportunities to learn and practice new adaptive behaviors that
      could enhance their ability to cope with infertility and the associated medical
      procedures.

TI  - Birth-related fatigue in 34-36-week preterm neonates: rapid recovery with very
      early kangaroo (skin-to-skin) care.
PG  - 94-103
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test preterm neonates' physiologic and behavioral responses when
      placed skin-to-skin on their mother's chests, called kangaroo care (KC), for the 
      first 6 hours after birth, instead of having the neonates go to an intensive care
      unit. DESIGN: Convenience sampling was used in this descriptive study to enroll
      neonates who were given continuous KC beginning soon after birth in the delivery 
      room and continuing for 6 hours. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation,
      abdominal temperature, and behavioral state were recorded each minute. SETTING:
      Data were collected in the delivery room and in a private labor room in tropical 
      Cali, Colombia. PARTICIPANTS: Six 34-36-week preterm neonates with 5-minute APGAR
      scores of 6 or more were enrolled. Two neonates had grunting respirations before 
      KC was begun. RESULTS: Temperature rose rapidly to thermoneutral range. With few 
      exceptions, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation remained within
      normal limits; grunting respirations in two neonates disappeared with warmed
      humidified oxygen and continuous KC. Sleep predominated, and neonates were
      discharged home by 48 hours being fully breastfed, suggesting that KC was an
      environment conducive to recovery from fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest
      that KC beginning in the delivery room can be given safely and perhaps with
      benefit to 34-36-week gestation neonates who appear healthy at birth. Kangaroo
      care was conducive to recovery from birth-related fatigue.

TI  - Alteration by maternal pinealectomy of fetal and neonatal melatonin and dopamine 
      D1 receptor binding in the suprachiasmatic nuclei.
PG  - 850-4
AB  - The effects of maternal melatonin on fetal and neonatal melatonin and dopamine D1
      receptor systems in the central nervous system, mainly in the suprachiasmatic
      nuclei (SCN), were investigated after pinealectomy of rats at day 7 of pregnancy.
      125I-labelled iodomelatonin injected intravenously into the pregnant rats (at day
      21) was transferred in considerable amount into the fetal circulation. In vitro
      autoradiography data demonstrated an increase in the melatonin binding activity
      in the fetal (embryonic day 21) and early postnatal SCN (postnatal day 3) caused 
      by maternal pinealectomy. This upregulation of the melatonin receptor in the SCN 
      was then normalized after the melatonin system of the neonate started to work.
      The pregnant rats themselves did not show such a change in their melatonin
      receptors in the SCN following pinealectomy. Dopamine D1 receptor binding was
      affected by pinealectomy exclusively in the SCN of fetal and neonatal rats as
      well as in that of mothers. These results clearly indicate that the fetal
      circadian clock in the SCN is controlled and prepared before birth to some extent
      by maternal melatonin rhythm.

      relationships to their infants' movements.
PG  - 1043-56
AB  - We studied changes in the sleep patterns of ten young women from late pregnancy
      (36 weeks) to the sixth postpartum week, focusing on the relationship between the
      women's sleep patterns and their infants' movements. The mothers' polysomnograms 
      and their infants' ankle actigrams were simultaneously recorded using a Medilog
      9000 at home in three sessions, during the first, third, and sixth postpartum
      weeks. The mother-infant pairs slept in close proximity. Two subjects had
      difficulty with their infants and were dealt with as a separate group. Analysis
      for the eight subjects who adapted well to the postpartum period showed that wake
      time after sleep onset increased significantly during the postpartum period
      compared with late pregnancy given responsibility for feeding. Stage 3 + 4 and
      Stage REM did not change across the four sessions (pregnancy, first, third, and
      sixth postpartum weeks), but Stage 2 decreased significantly from pregnancy to
      postpartum. There was a high synchronization between infants' movements and
      mothers' wakefulness. Eight mothers did not complain of sleep disturbance, while 
      the two mothers who had difficulty with their infants did. We suggest that
      mothers who tolerate well sleep interruption arising from feeding and maintain
      their Stages 3 + 4 and REM should not be considered as suffering from sleep
      disturbance. Mothers who have difficulty with their infants and complain of sleep
      disturbance should be considered as suffering from sleep disturbance.

TI  - Attention deficit disorder with developmental coordination disorders.
PG  - 207-12
AB  - AIMS: To analyse the contribution of certain social, familial, prenatal,
      perinatal, and developmental background factors in the pathogenesis of deficits
      in attention, motor control, and perception (DAMP). METHODS: A population based
      case-control study was carried out with 113 children aged 6 years, 62 diagnosed
      with DAMP and 51 controls without DAMP. The children's health and medical records
      were studied and their history with regard to background factors was taken at an 
      interview with the mother using a standardised schedule. Familial factors,
      possible non-optimal factors during pregnancy (including smoking), developmental 
      factors (including early language development), and medical and psychosocial data
      were scored in accordance with the reduced optimality method. RESULTS: Low
      socioeconomic class was common in the group with DAMP. Familial language disorder
      and familial motor clumsiness were found at higher rates in the DAMP group.
      Neuropathogenic risk factors in utero were also more common in the children with 
      DAMP. Maternal smoking during pregnancy appeared to be an important risk factor. 
      Language problems were present in two thirds of the children with DAMP. Sleep
      problems and gastrointestinal disorders, but not atopy or otitis media, were
      significantly more common in the DAMP group. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal familial and
      neuropathogenic risk factors contribute to the development of DAMP. Primary
      prevention, such as improved maternal health care and early detection or
      treatment, or both, of associated language problems appear to be essential.

TI  - [A severe case of acute autonomic and sensory neuropathy].
PG  - 663-8
AB  - Acute autonomic and sensory neuropathy (AASN) is a rare neuropathy characterized 
      by acute autonomic dysfunction and objective sensory disturbances. A 26-year-old 
      pregnant woman with severe autonomic and sensory dysfunction is reported. This
      patient suddenly developed marked nausea and vomitting in about 2 days after
      having a sore throat. She then developed signs of autonomic dysfunction including
      dilated non-reactive pupils, dryness of the eyes and oral mucous membranes,
      generalized anhidrosis, paralytic ileus, orthostatic hypotension, and continuous 
      tachycardia. She also had severe generalized sensory impairments of all
      modalities, and all deep tendon reflexes were absent. Sensation was almost
      totally lost for all modalities below the neck. There was marked pseudoathetosis 
      and sensory ataxia in all extremities. Motor examination was normal. She had
      inability to urinate. At this time she was 38 weeks pregnant, and when she showed
      signs of fetal distress, a Caesarean section was performed. Albumino-cytological 
      dissociation was seen in the CSF. Serum noradrenaline was reduced, no sensory
      nerve action potentials could be elicited, and reduced coefficient of variation
      of the R-R interval on electrocardiography was observed. Plasma exchange was
      performed every other day for 3 days for about 3 weeks after the onset of the
      illness, but no favorable effects. Seven months after the onset, her autonomic
      dysfunction slightly improved, but there was no recovery from the sensory
      disturbances. Many symptoms and signs that characterize AASN occurred in this
      patient, and each was severe. The patient developed SIADH, sleep apnea,
      personality change, and amenorrhea in the course of the disease. We suggest that 
      AASN patients might have both peripheral and central nervous system
      manifestations including seizures and personality changes.

TI  - [Leptin and human reproduction].
PG  - 410-4
AB  - Leptin is a secretory product of adipocytes. It has been suggested that leptin
      acts as an afferent satiety signal to the brain modulating the expression of the 
      orexigenic hypothalamic peptide, neuropeptide Y (NPY). Therefore leptin can be
      regarded as a marker of the nutritional status of the body. It was proposed that 
      human obesity may result from a central resistance to leptin due to different
      pathophysiological mechanisms: saturation of the leptin transport into the
      cerebrospinal fluid of the obese subjects, abnormalities in the hypothalamic
      receptor for leptin, or post-receptor transduction mechanisms. It was shown that 
      circulating leptin levels in humans significantly correlate with the body mass
      index (BMI). Although most studies point to white adipose tissue as a primary
      source of leptin there is still some uncertainty towards the relative expression 
      of leptin between various body fat compartments. LEPTIN AND ONSET OF PUBERTY:
      Studies on animal models recognized various metabolic candidates for modulation
      of GnRH neuronal activity. It was supposed that mild changes in the body's
      metabolic status can serve to regulate the central drive to the reproductive
      axis. It is likely that leptin can serve as a "metabolic cue" that transmits
      signals of those mild metabolic changes towards activation of the GnRH neuronal
      system at the end of the prepubertal period. On the other side there is a
      possibility of altered leptin pulsatility during prepubertal period that can
      consequently influence hypothalamus and GnRH neuronal system. LEPTIN AND SEXUAL
      DIMORPHISM: Leptin levels in humans are similar in both sexes during the
      prepubertal period. During puberty leptin has a tendency to decline in boys and
      to remain constant in girls. Puberty is also characterized with a similar
      circadian rhythm pattern between sexes whil girls express different pulse
      characteristics. It seems that sexual dimorphism is established in early phases
      of human development. There is a possibility of sex steroid influence on such
      sexual dimorphism. LEPTIN AND REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION: It was shown that
      administration of recombinant leptin to ob ob mice could restore fertility in
      these infertile animals. There is certain difference in leptin levels according
      to the phase of the menstrual cycle. It was shown that leptin peak is in the
      luteal phase of the cycle and that correlates to the maximal progesterone level. 
      It is possible that leptin could directly influence ovary and that disruption of 
      such an effect could play a role in menstrual irregularities in both obese and
      mal nourished women. This could even become a pathophysiological mechanism in
      women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It was supposed that leptin
      resistance could be involved in infertility impairment of the obese women with
      PCOS. Leptin increases during pregnancy. Appearance of placenta as a new,
      nonadipose source of leptin production, increases a possibility of different
      leptin mRNA expression through gestation.

      during pregnancy.
PG  - 427-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the differences in sleep of women throughout pregnancy
      compared with those of nonpregnant control subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Four pregnant 
      women were studied longitudinally during their pregnancy using inpatient
      polysomnography. Measurements included electroencephalography,
      electrocardiography, and continuous-pulse oximetry. Four healthy nonpregnant
      women matched for age and weight were used as control subjects. The total sleep
      time was recorded, and percentages of each sleep stage were generated. RESULTS:
      Qualitative differences in sleep between pregnancy patients and control subjects 
      were evident. Control subjects displayed a normal appearance of slow-wave sleep
      in stages 3 and 4 (delta sleep). When pregnant patients did display delta sleep, 
      it appeared abnormal secondary to extensive alpha-wave intrusion. Even when
      including this abnormal delta sleep in a quantitative comparison, the pregnant
      patients had a significantly shorter percentage of total sleep time in delta
      sleep (4.9+/-1.9% vs 21.9+/-6.0%, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Sleep in pregnancy is
      characterized by loss of normal slow-wave sleep. Thus, sleep stages 3 and 4 are
      shortened during pregnancy. This sleep alteration is persistent when followed
      longitudinally during pregnancy.

TI  - The role of melatonin in the human fetus (review).
PG  - 539-43
AB  - Melatonin, an indole amine, primarily derived from the pineal gland is secreted
      during the hours of darkness. Melatonin acts as a hormonal transduction of
      photoperiod influencing the timing of seasonal and daily (circadian)
      physiological rhythms. Maternal melatonin crosses the placenta and enters the
      fetal circulation providing photoperiodic information to the fetus influencing
      the subsequent circadian and seasonal rhythms of the offspring. The function of
      melatonin in humans is more obscure. However, melatonin has attained prominence
      as a treatment for disturbed circadian rhythms and sleep patterns which occur as 
      a result of transmeridian travel, shift work or blindness. The biological clock, 
      the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), possesses melatonin receptors, in 
      both the adult and fetal human. This concurs with the reported influence of
      melatonin on human circadian rhythmicity and indicates that this influence may
      begin in utero. Melatonin receptors are widespread in the human fetus and occur
      in both central and peripheral tissue from early in fetal development. Thus, the 
      influence of melatonin on the developing human fetus may not be limited to
      entraining circadian rhythmicity. Considering the transplacental availability of 
      melatonin to the fetus the ingestion of melatonin by pregnant women may be
      inadvisable.

TI  - Perinatal nicotine exposure impairs ability of newborn rats to autoresuscitate
      from apnea during hypoxia.
PG  - 2066-74
AB  - Failure to autoresuscitate by hypoxic gasping during prolonged sleep apnea has
      been suggested to play a role in sudden infant death. Furthermore, maternal
      smoking has been repeatedly shown to be a risk factor for sudden infant death.
      The present experiments were carried out on newborn rat pups to investigate the
      influence of perinatal exposure to nicotine (the primary pharmacological and
      addictive agent in tobacco) on their time to last gasp during a single hypoxic
      exposure and on their ability to autoresuscitate during repeated exposure to
      hypoxia. Pregnant rats received either nicotine (6 mg. kg-1. 24 h-1) or vehicle
      continuously from day 6 of gestation to days 5 or 6 postpartum via an osmotic
      minipump. On days 5 or 6 postpartum, pups were exposed either to a single period 
      of hypoxia (97% N2-3% CO2) and their time to last gasp was determined, or they
      were exposed repeatedly to hypoxia and their ability to autoresuscitate from
      primary apnea was determined. Perinatal exposure to nicotine did not alter the
      time to last gasp, but it did impair the ability of pups to autoresuscitate from 
      primary apnea. After vehicle, the pups were able to autoresuscitate from 18 +/- 1
      (SD) periods of hypoxia, whereas, after nicotine, the pups were able to
      autoresuscitate from only 12 +/- 2 periods (P < 0.001) of hypoxia. Thus our data 
      provide evidence that perinatal exposure to nicotine impairs the ability of
      newborn rats to autoresuscitate from primary apnea during repeated exposure to
      hypoxia, such as may occur during episodes of prolonged sleep apnea.

TI  - Migraine in pregnancy: what are the safest treatment options?
PG  - 383-8
AB  - The occurrence of migraine in women is influenced by hormonal changes throughout 
      the lifecycle. A beneficial effect of pregnancy on migraine, mainly during the
      last 2 trimesters, has been observed in 55 to 90% of women who are pregnant,
      irrespective of the type of migraine. A higher percentage of women with menstrual
      migraine find that their condition improves when they are pregnant. However, in
      rare cases migraine may appear for the first time during pregnancy. The positive 
      effects of pregnancy on migraine and the possible worsening post partum are
      probably related to the uniformly high and stable estrogen levels during
      pregnancy and the rapid fall-off thereafter. Nondrug therapies (relaxation,
      sleep, massage, ice packs, biofeedback) should be tried first to treat migraine
      in women who are pregnant. For treatment of acute migraine attacks 1000 mg of
      paracetamol (acetaminophen) preferably as a suppository is considered the first
      choice drug treatment. The risks associated with use of aspirin (acetylsalicylic 
      acid) and ibuprofen are considered to be small when the agents are taken
      episodically and if they are avoided during the last trimester of pregnancy. The 
      'triptans' (sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan), dihydroergotamine and
      ergotamine tartrate are contraindicated in women who are pregnant.
      Prochlorperazine for treatment of nausea is unlikely to be harmful during
      pregnancy. Metoclopramide is probably acceptable to use during the second and
      third trimester. Prophylactic treatment is rarely indicated and the only agents
      that can be given during pregnancy are the beta-blockers metoprolol and
      propranolol.

TI  - Assessment of infant sleeping position--selected states, 1996.
PG  - 873-7
AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of postneonatal
      mortality in the United States. In 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
      recommended that all healthy babies be put to sleep either on their back or side 
      to reduce the risk for SIDS. In 1994, a national "Back to Sleep" education
      campaign was initiated to encourage the public and health-care providers to put
      babies to sleep on their back or side. In November 1996, the AAP modified its
      policy to preferentially recommend putting infants on their back because of the
      lower risk for SIDS associated with this position relative to the side position. 
      To assess adherence to recommendations for infant sleeping position, CDC analyzed
      population-based data on the usual infant sleeping position for 1996 births by
      race from 10 states participating in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring
      System (PRAMS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis and indicates
      that infant sleeping position varied by state and race.

TI  - Acute maternal alcohol consumption disrupts behavioral state organization in the 
      near-term fetus.
PG  - 774-9
AB  - Disturbed sleep regulation is often observed in neonates of women who drank
      heavily during pregnancy. It is unknown if (and how) an occasional drink affects 
      fetal sleeping behavior. In 28 near-term pregnant women we examined the effects
      on fetal behavioral state organization of two glasses of wine (0.25 g of
      ethanol/kg of maternal body weight). Simultaneous 2-h recordings of fetal heart
      rate and body, eye, and breathing movements were made on two successive days,
      once without alcohol exposure and once during maternal alcohol consumption. The
      study was standardized for time of day and fetal sleep state, i.e., the start of 
      recording was either during quiet sleep (n = 16) or during active sleep (n = 12).
      Alcohol intake reduced fetal eye movements, disorganized behavioral state
      organization (rapid eye movement sleep was affected in particular), and
      suppressed fetal breathing activity almost completely. Modest maternal alcohol
      intake affects fetal behavioral state organization, which reflects an immediate
      effect on fetal brain function.

TI  - State transitions in uncomplicated pregnancies after term.
PG  - 125-32
AB  - A behavioural state transition is the time interval between two different
      behavioural states. In low-risk fetuses, the fetal heart rate pattern (FHRP) is
      the first variable to change in transitions from 1F to 2F ('non-REM-sleep' to
      'REM-sleep') and the last variable to change in transitions from 2F to 1F. This
      is not the case in IUGR (intra-uterine growth retardation), and absence of a
      specific order in which behavioural variables are changing might be an indication
      for a (mild) disturbance of the fetal central nervous system (CNS). We
      investigated whether state transitions in twelve low risk term fetuses (39-41
      weeks post menstrual age, PMA; control group) differ from those in twelve
      uncomplicated pregnancies > 41 weeks PMA (study group). All subjects underwent
      one behavioural study in which fetal heart rate pattern, eye and body movements
      were recorded simultaneously. We recorded 23 transitions from 1F to 2F and 20
      from 2F to 1F. Median (range) duration for transitions from 1F to 2F was 85
      (10-180) s in the study group, and 60 (10-180) s in the control group.
      Transitions from 2F to 1F lasted 80 (10-140) and 60 (30-100) s, respectively. In 
      both groups, the FHRP was the first variable to change in transitions from 1F to 
      2F, however, in transitions from 2F to 1F, no specific order in change of
      variables could be demonstrated. We conclude that the study of transitions does
      not distinguish between the term and after term fetuses under optimal conditions.
      Whether or not the analysis of state transitions can be used to distinguish
      'normal' from 'abnormal' fetuses and detect the fetus at risk after term awaits
      further study.

TI  - [Hand symptoms and pregnancy].
PG  - 5791-4
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to identify the incidence of hand symptoms
      related to pregnancy in a Danish population. Three hundred and thirty-five
      consecutive postpartum patients were interviewed by questionnaire. Hand symptoms 
      had been noted by 16%, among these 30% described a classic median-nerve symptom
      distribution (carpal tunnel syndrome) and 24% of patients described an ulnar
      nerve distribution. Most symptoms were bilateral, commenced in the third
      trimester and resolved soon after delivery. There was a significant correlation
      of hand symptoms in pregnancy with the presence of swelling and a significant
      correlation to parity (first). Hand function and sleep had been disturbed in half
      of the patients. Half of the patients had mentioned their symptoms to their
      doctor and one had been sent to treatment. Hand symptoms during pregnancy are
      common, and their severity is often underestimated. Symptoms of the carpal tunnel
      syndrome are easily relieved by a night splint.

TI  - Effect of pregnane steroids on electrocortical activity and somatosensory evoked 
      potentials in fetal sheep.
PG  - 111-4
AB  - The effect of infusing the neuroactive steroids pregnanolone and iso-pregnanolone
      on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and electrocortical (ECoG) activity was 
      studied in unanaesthetised fetal sheep, 130-135 days gestation. Intravenous
      infusion of pregnanolone (6 mg/kg per h) significantly increased the proportion
      of high voltage ECoG (56.1+/-4.8% vs. control 43.5+/-3.2%, P < 0.05), and
      decreased low voltage ECoG (43.9+/-4.8% vs. control 56.6+/-3.2%, P < 0.05).
      Pregnanolone treatment decreased the amplitude of the N25 peak of the SEP
      (89.9+/-2.8% of control, P < 0.05) evoked following stimulation of the skin of
      the upper lip. In contrast, iso-pregnanolone treatment had no effect on ECoG
      activities, or on the amplitude and latency of peaks in the SEP. We conclude that
      3alpha-hydroxy pregnane steroids are active at GABA(A) receptors in fetal sheep
      and can modulate sleep/wake activity before birth.

PG  - 731-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to systematically investigate previous
      anecdotal reports of memory decline during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: We used a
      longitudinal design to investigate memory in women throughout pregnancy and in
      the postpartum period. Closely matched, nonpregnant women were similarly studied 
      at equivalent intervals. We also assessed degree of depression and anxiety.
      RESULTS: There was a significant time-by-group interaction (P < .01) for both
      immediate and delayed recall of paragraph length material. Contrasts showed a
      significant decline in memory for the pregnant group from the second to the third
      trimester (P < .01). No significant changes in memory were noted for the control 
      group. The pregnant women scored higher on both depression and anxiety scales;
      however, somatic rather than cognitive items accounted for the elevated scores.
      Fluctuations in mood and memory did not coincide. CONCLUSION: There is a
      pregnancy-related decline in memory, which is limited to the third trimester. The
      decline is not attributable to depression, anxiety, sleep deprivation, or other
      physical changes associated with pregnancy.

TI  - Neonatal alcohol exposure produces hyperactivity in high-alcohol-sensitive but
      not in low-alcohol-sensitive rats.
PG  - 237-42
AB  - Children of women who consume high amounts of alcohol during their pregnancies
      vary greatly in physical and behavioral outcomes. Although many factors, such as 
      dose and timing of exposure, undoubtedly contribute to this variation, one
      important determinant may be genetic differences in the response to alcohol. The 
      present study examined activity levels in high alcohol sensitivity (HAS) and low 
      alcohol sensitivity (LAS) rats following neonatal alcohol exposure. These lines
      were selectively bred for extremes in ethanol-induced "sleep times." The HAS and 
      LAS offspring were exposed to alcohol via an artificial rearing procedure using
      the "pup-in-the-cup" technique. Rat pups were exposed to ethanol (6 g/kg/day)
      from postnatal day (PD) 4 through 7 and faded to a dose of 3 g/kg/day on PD 8 and
      9. An artificially reared gastrostomy control group (GC) and a normally reared
      suckle control group (SC) were also included. Activity level was measured on PD
      18 through PD 21 for 30 min daily in automated activity monitors. Neonatal
      ethanol exposure produced overactivity in HAS rats, relative to their controls,
      but the same ethanol treatment had no effect on the LAS rats. Importantly, there 
      were no differences in blood alcohol concentrations (around 420 mg/dl) between
      the two lines during the treatment period. These data suggest that genetic
      differences in response to alcohol may be a predictor for some of the behavioral 
      teratogenic effects of alcohol.

TI  - Follow-up of sexual assault victims.
PG  - 336-42
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to describe medical findings and health-related concerns
      of sexual assault victims who returned for follow-up and to assess demographic
      and assault characteristics of victims who used follow-up services compared to
      those who did not. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a retrospective cohort analysis
      involving records from two sources: the acute sexual assault evidentiary
      examination and the SAFE (Sexual Assault Follow-up Evaluation) Clinic visit. Data
      were extracted from the records of 389 adolescent and adult victims who reported 
      an acute sexual assault and underwent a complete evidentiary examination between 
      January 1, 1995, and June 30, 1997. Descriptive statistics were generated on
      demographic and historical information, assault characteristics, and medical and 
      laboratory findings. For the subgroup that presented for follow-up, additional
      descriptive statistics were generated to describe their interim history,
      concerns, medical outcomes, treatments, and psychosocial functioning. Chi2
      analyses were used to identify differences in the group that returned for
      follow-up compared with the group that did not. Statistical significance was
      defined as P < .05. RESULTS: There were no differences in age, race, or
      perpetrator factors between patients who used follow-up services and patients who
      did not return to the SAFE Clinic. Similarly, there were no other assault
      characteristics, relationships, or physical examination findings that were
      associated with follow-up patterns. A total of 31% (n = 122) of all sexual
      assault victims returned for a follow-up visit. Physical complaints were reported
      by 42.6%, but 98.0% had normal findings at a general examination, and 94.8% had a
      normal result of gynecologic examination. Pregnancy and sexually transmitted
      diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus, were identified through the
      follow-up clinic. Since the assault, 49.2% had been sexually active, 10% with
      multiple partners and 73.3% without consistent condom use. Disturbances in sleep,
      sexual function, and appetite were commonly reported among victims at follow-up. 
      Numerous assault-related fears were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Among recent rape
      victims, follow-up rates are low, and there are no factors that correlate with
      the use of follow-up services. Those who do come in for follow-up have physical
      complaints and health-related concerns that are related to their recent assault, 
      but most have normal physical findings. Efforts to reach sexual assault victims
      will require aggressive and innovative strategies to remain in contact with women
      and girls after rape.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy resulting in pulmonary hypertension.
PG  - 761-2
AB  - Obesity is known to increase maternal morbidity and mortality. We describe a case
      of obstructive sleep apnea due to obesity and discuss our treatment of the
      resulting pulmonary hypertension. A patient was transferred to our hospital at 29
      weeks' gestation with severe anasarca and more than a 100-pound weight gain
      during pregnancy. Pulmonary hypertension due to obstructive sleep apnea was
      diagnosed. The patient was treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) during sleep and remained in the hospital the remainder of her pregnancy. 
      She had a massive spontaneous diuresis during her hospital stay and lost more
      than 100 pounds. She was delivered at term via cesarean section because of
      transverse lie. Preoperative hemodynamic monitoring confirmed the diagnosis of
      pulmonary hypertension. This represents the first case in the literature of
      obstructive sleep apnea leading to pulmonary hypertension in pregnancy. This
      patient responded well to nasal CPAP as evident by the massive diuresis and good 
      maternal outcome.

TI  - Prenatal malnutrition-induced changes in blood pressure: dissociation of stress
      and nonstress responses using radiotelemetry.
PG  - 108-14
AB  - A link between prenatal malnutrition and hypertension in human populations has
      recently been proposed. Rat models of prenatal malnutrition have provided major
      support for this theory on the basis of tail-cuff measurements. However, this
      technique requires restraint and elevated temperature, both potential sources of 
      stress. To determine the effect of prenatal protein malnutrition on blood
      pressure under nonstress conditions, 24-hour radiotelemetric measurements were
      taken in the home cage. Male rats born to dams fed a 6% casein diet for 5 weeks
      before mating and throughout pregnancy were studied in early adulthood (from 96
      days of age). During the waking phase of their cycle but not the sleep phase,
      prenatal malnutrition gave rise to small but significant elevations of diastolic 
      blood pressure and heart rate compared with well-nourished controls. Direct
      effects of stress on blood pressure responses were determined in a second
      experiment using an olfactory stressor. Prenatally malnourished rats showed a
      greater increase in both systolic and diastolic pressures compared with
      well-nourished controls during the first exposure to ammonia. A different pattern
      of change of cardiovascular responses was also observed during subsequent
      presentations of the stressor. These findings of a small baseline increase in
      diastolic pressure consequent to prenatal malnutrition, but an augmented
      elevation of both systolic and diastolic pressures after first exposure to
      stress, suggest the need to reevaluate interpretation of the large elevations in 
      blood pressure previously observed in malnourished animals using the stressful
      tail-cuff procedure.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of vasodilators. Part II.
PG  - 9-36
AB  - Stimulating cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors with oxyfedrine causes dilatation of
      coronary vessels and positive inotropic effects on the myocardium. beta
      1-adrenergic agonists increase coronary blood flow in nonstenotic and stenotic
      vessels. The main indication for the use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors
      pamrinone, mirinone, enoximone and piroximone is acute treatment of severe
      congestive heart failure. Theophylline is indicated for the treatment of asthma, 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, apnea in preterm infants ans sleep apnea
      syndrome. Severe arterial occlusive disease associated with atherosclerosis can
      be beneficially affected by elcosanoids. These drugs must be administered
      parenterally and have a half-life of only a few minutes. Sublingual or buccal
      preparations of nitrates are the only prompt method (within 1 or 2 min) of
      terminating anginal pain, except for biting nifedipine capsules. The short
      half-life (about 2.5 min) of nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) makes long term 
      therapy impossible. Tolerance is a problem encountered with longer-acting nitric 
      oxide donors. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of vasodilating drugs
      can prevent a too sudden and severe blood pressure decrease in patients with
      chronic hypertension. In considering the administration of a second dose, or
      another drug, the time necessary for the initially administered drug to reach
      maximal efficacy should be taken into account. In hypertensive emergencies
      urapidil, sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, hydralazine and phentolamine are
      the drugs of choice, with the addition of beta-blockers during catecholamine
      crisis or dissecting aortic aneurysm. Childhood hypertension is most often
      treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium
      antagonists, primarily nifedipine. Because of the teratogenic risk involved with 
      ACE inhibitors, extreme caution must be exercised when prescribing for adolescent
      females. The propagation of health benefits to breast-fed infants, combined with 
      more women delaying pregnancy until their fourth decade, has entailed an increase
      in the need for hypertension management during lactation. Low dose
      hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, nifedipine and enalapril or captopril do not
      pose enough of a risk of preclude breastfeeding in this group. The most
      frequently used antihypertensive agents during pregnancy are methyldopa,
      labetalol and calcium channel antagonists. Methyldopa and beta-blockers are the
      drugs of choice for treating mild to moderate hypertension. Prazosin and
      hydralazine are used to treat moderate to severe hypertension and hydralazine,
      urapidil or labetalol are used to treat hypertensive emergencies. The use of
      overly aggressive antihypertensive therapy during pregnancy should be avoided so 
      that adequate uteroplacental blood flow is maintained. Methyldopa is the only
      drug accepted for use during the first trimester of pregnancy.

TI  - Diurnal rhythm of fetal behavioral state.
PG  - 167-76
AB  - To test for the presence in utero of diurnal periodicity in the amount of time
      spent in organized behavioral states, seven records of 24-hour duration were
      obtained from each of five chronically instrumented fetal baboons between 144 and
      158 days gestation (term = 175 days). Concordance of fetal breathing activity,
      heart-period variability, and electroencephalographic parameters were used to
      define two distinctive patterns of fetal physiological activities. One pattern
      was characterized as EEG activity dominated by trace alternant, reduced
      heart-period variability, and fewer breaths in epochs of fetal breathing. This
      fetal behavioral state (1FB) is analogous to quiet sleep in infants. A second
      pattern was characterized by the relative absence of trace alternant, increased
      heart-period variability, and fetal breathing activity. This fetal behavioral
      state (2FB) is analogous to active sleep. Cycles of these states were present 29%
      of time, with a duration of approximately 26 minutes and a 1.7:1 predominance of 
      2FB/1FB. Cosinor analysis across fetuses revealed a significant (p < .01) 24-hour
      periodicity of the time spent by the fetus in organized behavioral states, with a
      peak around 1400 (lights-on 0700 to 1900) and a peak-nadir fluctuation of 15%.
      These periodicities in the incidence of organized state were significant (p <
      .01) in three fetuses, and approached significance (< .09) in the two others.
      Data demonstrate a diurnal rhythmicity in fetal behavioral states, with less time
      spent in organized state at night than during the day.

      cardiorespiratory recording was performed and the data stored in local memory
      before transmission on demand via modem to Oxford next morning. The telemetry of 
      the physiological data, entirely managed by part-time community nurses in
      Portsmouth, was very successful. Despite some losses, which included transmission
      failures, electrode or lead disconnection, and monitor malfunction, 92% of the
      physiological data were analysed at Oxford. Personalized physiological monitoring
      in the community provides an opportunity for new evidence bases that will enable 
      a new level of individualized care.

TI  - Childhood sleep problems: association with prenatal factors and maternal
      distress/depression.
PG  - 263-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether problems with childhood sleep behaviour are
      associated with either maternal sleep patterns and emotional status during the
      pregnancy period, or levels of maternal distress and depression during the
      postnatal period. METHODOLOGY: A case/control comparison study. Cases were
      families presenting for admissions to a mother/baby hospital in Brisbane with the
      major presenting problem being the child's sleep behaviour. The control group
      consisted of families presenting for well child health care to one of four child 
      health centres in suburban Brisbane. Each participating mother provided
      information by way of a self-report questionnaire on social and demographic
      variables, children's sleep patterns, maternal emotional adjustment and maternal 
      sleep pattern during the pregnancy, and current problem with child's sleep
      behaviour. Current level of maternal distress/depression, was measured using the 
      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Cases were compared with controls on all
      these variables. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between groups in
      childhood sleep parameters, degree of problem related to childhood sleep,
      maternal sleep variables during the entire pregnancy, and current levels of
      maternal distress/depression. CONCLUSION: The origins of problematic childhood
      sleep behaviour may lie in the pregnancy period. Levels of maternal distress and 
      depression are associated with problematic childhood sleep behaviour. The issue
      of whether childhood sleep problem predisposes to maternal distress/depression
      needs exploration. Assessment of maternal mood disorder or childhood sleep
      problems should be comprehensive and involve both the maternal infant dyad and
      the family network.

TI  - An animal model for pregnancy-associated sleep disorder.
PG  - 209-11
AB  - We studied basic sleep changes in pregnant rats in order to understand how
      pregnancy alters sleep. In the rat, pregnancy increased nocturnal nonREM sleep
      across the entire period but increased REM sleep only in the early period. By the
      end of pregnancy, diurnal sleep was decreased, showing that pregnancy in rats
      causes biphasic sleep changes as it does in humans. Termination of pregnancy
      returned the enhanced sleep to baseline as in the estrous cycle. Therefore,
      significant changes in the pattern of sleep occurred during pregnancy in rats,
      suggesting that the animal model may contribute to understanding the mechanism of
      sleep disorders related to human pregnancy.

PG  - 201-2
AB  - Sleep log study, which was designed to study sleep characteristics by
      questionnaire, was performed on 172 pregnant women about the relationship between
      their pregnancy and their night sleep. Sleep behavior by sleep log revealed that 
      they woke more frequently during the course of their pregnancy and that their
      total sleep time decreased gradually toward the end of their pregnancy. According
      to their subjective evaluations, these shortages of night sleep could not be made
      up with the morning naps in the multiparas as was the case of the primiparas.
      These changes in sleep characteristics have been studied from biological,
      psychological and social factors view points.

TI  - Diurnal variation in baseline heart rate of anencephalic fetuses.
PG  - 173-4
AB  - The diurnal change in baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) of four anencephalic
      fetuses at 20, 23, 24 and 30 weeks of gestation were examined. The mean baseline 
      FHR in 00.00-06.00 h, 06.00-12.00 h, 12.00-18.00 h and 18.00-24.00 h were
      compared by one-factor ANOVA and Scheffe's test in each case. The diurnal
      variations in baseline FHR were recognized in all subjects (P < 0.01). In 3/4
      subjects, the lowest values were at 00.00-06.00 h. The diurnal variation in
      baseline FHR might be caused by maternal factors because it was present even in
      the anencephalic fetuses that had no central nervous system having the
      oscillators of the circadian rhythm.

TI  - Comparative studies on the initiation of labor.
PG  - 127-32
AB  - Parturition is a multifactorial physiological process that involves multiple
      interconnected positive feedforward and negative feedback loops. Each of these
      loops is connected to others in a carefully time-regulated fashion. When
      parturition occurs normally, both fetal and maternal processes are involved.
      Recent research in pregnant sheep and nonhuman primates shows clearly that the
      fetus determines the duration of gestation and the mother determines the time of 
      day at which labor begins. The fetal hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis plays a
      fundamental role in stimulating increased estrogen production in late gestation. 
      Estrogen then activates maternal circadian rhythms that increase oxytocin
      secretion. As a result, uterine contraction patterns are switched from
      contractures to contractions.

TI  - Coordination between glottic adductor muscle and diaphragm EMG activity in fetal 
      lambs in utero.
PG  - 1560-5
AB  - It has previously been reported that active glottic adduction is present during
      prolonged apneas but absent during periods of breathing movements in fetal lambs 
      in utero. The present study was aimed at examining the precise coordination
      between fetal breathing movements [diaphragm electromyographic (EMG) activity (Di
      EMG)] and glottic adduction [thyroarytenoid muscle EMG activity (TA EMG)].
      Electrodes for electroencephalogram, eye movements, TA EMG, and Di EMG and an
      arterial catheter were surgically implanted in fetal lambs 123-142 days
      postconception. Polygraphic recordings were performed without sedation while the 
      ewe breathed room air (n = 11) or various gas mixtures (hypoxia, n = 5;
      hyperoxia, n = 4; hypercapnia, n = 5; hypercapnia+hyperoxia, n = 5). Tonic TA EMG
      was observed throughout >90% of apneas (>6 s) in both non-rapid-eye-movement and 
      rapid-eye-movement sleep, and when Di EMG frequency decreased in
      rapid-eye-movement sleep. In all but two fetuses, TA EMG was immediately
      inhibited when Di EMG appeared. Altering blood gases did not modify these
      results. In conclusion, Di EMG and TA EMG are well coordinated in late gestation 
      in fetal lambs, except in a few cases. These findings may have consequences for
      understanding the pathogenesis of mixed/obstructive apneas of prematurity.

TI  - Polydrug-using adolescent mothers and their infants receiving early intervention.
PG  - 117-43
AB  - This study investigated the effects of an intervention for polydrug-using
      adolescent mothers. The program included educational, vocational, and parenting
      classes; social and drug rehab; and day care for their infants while they
      attended school half-day. The drug-exposed infants were similar to the nonexposed
      infants on traditional birth measures, although they had inferior Brazelton
      Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale scores, including habituation, orientation, 
      abnormal reflexes, general irritability, and regulatory capacity. The
      drug-exposed infants also spent less time in quiet sleep and more time crying and
      showing stress behaviors. Both the mothers and the infants in the drug groups
      demonstrated inferior interactions, and their dopamine and serotonin levels were 
      significantly higher. As early as 3 months (following 3 months of intervention), 
      the drug rehab mothers and their infants looked more like the nondrug group in
      their interactions; by 6 months, they looked similar on virtually every measure. 
      At 12 months, the infants of drug rehab mothers (versus the drug control group)
      had superior Early Social Communication Scale scores and Bayley Mental scale
      scores, as well as significantly greater head circumference and fewer pediatric
      complications. The drug rehab mothers also improved on several lifestyle
      variables. They demonstrated a lower incidence of continued drug use and repeat
      pregnancy, and a greater number continued school, received a high school or
      general equivalency diploma, or were placed in a job. Thus, a relatively
      cost-effective high school based intervention had positive effects on both
      adolescent mothers who had used drugs and their infants.

OAB - The impact of an early childhood intervention program on polydrug-abusing US
      adolescent mothers and their infants was evaluated. The program, which was
      located in a vocational school attended by the mothers, included drug
      rehabilitation, social skills training, parenting classes, job training, and
      relaxation therapy. Outcomes in 126 drug-exposed mothers 16-21 years of age who
      participated in the program were compared to those recorded among non-drug-using 
      adolescent mothers who participated in the program and drug-using control mothers
      who did not participate. All three groups were similar in terms of age,
      education, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity, but drug-abusing mothers had
      higher rates of depression and stress. At baseline, drug-exposed infants had
      lower scores on the measures of habituation, orientation, abnormal reflexes,
      general irritability, and regulatory capacity on the Neonatal Behavioral
      Assessment Scale. Drug-exposed infants spent less time sleeping and more time
      crying and showing stress behaviors. The drug groups also had lower Optimal
      Interaction Rating Scale scores for both mothers and infants. Their dopamine and 
      serotonin levels were higher than those recorded among non-drug-using mothers and
      their cortisol levels were lower. However, after 6 months of participation in the
      intervention program, the drug-using mothers had Beck Depression Inventory scores
      and interaction ratings that approached those of non-drug-using mothers and
      exceeded those among drug-using controls. Similar trends were observed for
      infants' head circumference and scores on the Early Social Communication Scale
      and the Bayley Mental Status Scale. Moreover, drug-using adolescent mothers who
      participated in the program demonstrated a lower incidence of repeat pregnancy
      and continued drug use than those who were not enrolled in the program; moreover,
      they were more likely to receive their high school diploma and be placed in jobs.
      Interventions such as this have the potential to attenuate the developmental
      delays of infants of drug-exposed adolescents.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in pregnancy: what is normal?
PG  - 836-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring holds great
      promise as a useful tool in the management of hypertensive pregnancies and
      pregnancies considered "at risk" for development of preeclampsia. The purpose of 
      this study was to define ambulatory blood pressure monitoring parameters
      throughout normal pregnancy, including women considered at risk for development
      of hypertension who continued to have a completely normal pregnancy. STUDY
      DESIGN: Two hundred seventy-six 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      studies were made cross-sectionally with use of a Spacelabs 90207 device
      (validated for use in pregnancy), at one or more of 9 to 17, 18 to 22, 26 to 30, 
      and >30 weeks' gestation. Upper limits of normal were defined as the mean plus 2 
      SDs for awake and sleep ambulatory blood pressure monitoring results at each
      stage. RESULTS: Average awake upper limits of normal were 130/77, 132/79, 133/81,
      and 135/86 mm Hg at the four stages of pregnancy, respectively. Systolic blood
      pressure fell significantly by 12% to 14% (p < 0.0001) and diastolic blood
      pressure by 18% to 19% (p < 0.0001) during sleep at all stages of pregnancy.
      Awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring systolic measurements were 11 to 12 mm
      Hg higher than "clinic" measurements (p < 0.001) and diastolic measurements were 
      5 to 11 mm Hg higher (p < 0.0001) throughout pregnancy. Maximum blood pressure
      variability ranged from 8 to 13 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: The upper limits of normal
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring-derived measurements rise slightly as
      pregnancy progresses. Awake measurements are higher than "clinic" measurements
      recorded under relaxed conditions by a clinical researcher. The diurnal blood
      pressure fall and variabilities are similar during pregnancy to those seen in
      nonpregnant subjects. These data should provide valuable references for further
      studies of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in high risk pregnancies.

TI  - Fetal sex and variations in kinetic properties of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase
      during the second trimester of normal pregnancy.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - A kinetic parameter (the Vm/Km ratio), an index of neutrophil alkaline
      phosphatase catalytic efficiency, was studied in 36 women with normal pregnancies
      at 16-20 weeks' gestation. On each blood sample, determinations were achieved on 
      enzyme extracted from maternal granulocytes by monitoring the phosphohydrolytic
      activity at 400 nm on a spectrophotometer equipped with software for computation 
      of kinetic parameters. Infant sex was recorded at the delivery for all women
      included in this study. The recent introduction of NAP as a marker for some
      pathological pregnancies requires a better knowledge of the behaviour of that
      enzyme in physiological conditions. Data reported focus attention on fetal sex.
      It appears to be one of the factors involved in variations of kinetic parameters 
      observed in maternal NAP. Sex-linked differences in placental maturation could
      explain these results.

TI  - [Breast cancer and heredity: results of a population case-control study in
      Girona].
PG  - 370-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: To characterise the relationship between breast cancer and different 
      aspects of the reproductive life, use of drugs and alcohol by family history of
      breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From the cancer registry of Girona, Spain,
      330 women were identified with histologically confirmed breast cancer during
      1986-1989. For each case, a control woman was selected from a random sample of
      the population living in the matched area to the case by age (+/- 5 yr.). The
      information was collected by a personal interview and included: family history of
      breast cancer, reproductive history, presence of acne during the teenage years,
      use of oral contraceptives and drugs for sleep and anxiety disorders, and alcohol
      consumption. RESULTS: 18.5% of breast cancer cases and 8.9% of all controls had a
      family history of breast cancer. Family history on a first degree relative
      (mother or sister) was present in 10.6% of the cases and 2.8% of controls, which 
      represented an odds ratio for breast cancer of 3.7 (95% CI, 1.8-7.8) higher than 
      the general population. Women with a first degree family history of breast cancer
      were at higher risk for breast cancer if they had a history of acne during the
      teenage period (OR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.2) and if they referred long menstrual
      periods in the early years of menarche (OR = 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.0). Women with no
      family history had a higher breast cancer risk if they had a late menarche, long 
      menstrual periods, late first full term pregnancy, and history of acne during
      puberty. Alcohol consumption and use of drugs for anxiety and sleep disorders
      were associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: First degree
      family history of breast cancer seems to be the best risk indicator for
      developing breast cancer. Long menstrual periods and presence of acne during
      puberty may indicate hormonal imbalance that act independently of the family
      history in breast cancer development.

TI  - Hourly fetal urine production rate in the near-term fetus: is it really increased
      during fetal quiet sleep?
PG  - 263-72
AB  - Fetal bladder volume and hourly fetal urine production (HFUPR) is calculated on
      the assumption that the fetal bladder is ellipsoid in shape. A recent validation 
      study demonstrated a progressive overestimation at increasing bladder volumes.
      This may be due to changes in shape of the fetal bladder at increasing volumes.
      Two independent papers have shown increased HFUPR during fetal behavioural state 
      1F (S1F) when compared with S2F. The aim of the present study was to assess
      whether this increase of HFUPR during S1F, previously observed by others, could
      be the result of an error introduced by the method of volume calculation. A
      retrospective evaluation was performed in a series of 208 HFUPR measurements in
      123 normal near term pregnant women attending a low-risk atenatal clinic.
      Adequate bladder filling in both states was identified in 43 recordings. Maximum 
      fetal bladder volumes were greater (> 10 ml) during S1F in comparison to S2F in
      56% of these recordings and HFUPR was significantly greater during S1F only in
      these cases. Bladder volumes are usually lower during S2F as a result of fetal
      voiding, which occurred in association with 22 of 36 transitions from S1F to S2F,
      and only 1 of 13 transitions from S2F to S1F (P < 0.001). When disregarding
      calculated bladder volumes in excess of 20 ml for the purpose of calculating
      HFUPR, eleven recordings remained. HFUPR calculated in this way was significantly
      lower in comparison to measurements where larger bladder volumes were included
      and no difference was observed between states. This implies that the differences 
      observed are the result of the greater error in calculating bladder volumes and
      HFUPR during S1F, where volumes are usually greater and that calculation of fetal
      bladder volume should not be performed on the assumption that the bladder is
      ellipsoid in shape. Alternative techniques include limiting measurements to a
      maximum volume of approximately 20 ml, when the bladder is usually ellipsoid in
      shape or basing volume calculation on the surface area of a series of sagittal
      views as suggested by Hedriana and Moore [Hedriana HL, Moore TR. Ultrasonographic
      evaluation of human fetal urinary flow rate: accuracy of bladder volume
      estimations. Am J Obstet Gynecol 1994;170:1250-1254; Hedriana HL, Moore TR.

PG  - 71-4
AB  - We report on a patient with a diagnosed obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) 
      who became pregnant during treatment with the nCPAP (nasal continuous positive
      airway pressure) apparatus, and gave birth. In the literature search we didn't
      find any similar case report. The present view on OSAS treatment with particular 
      regard to the use of nCPAP is also presented. Through reviewing literature we
      analysed positive effects of this kind of treatment on mother and fetus. The
      negative aspects of nCPAP treatment are discussed.

TI  - Lack of deafness in Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1: a patient survey.
PG  - E9
AB  - We performed a questionnaire survey about 42 patients with Crigler-Najjar
      syndrome type 1 who were currently alive. Information was obtained on their age, 
      sex, birth weight, gestation, parental consanguinity, other family members
      affected, age of onset of jaundice, neonatal and postneonatal bilirubin values,
      neonatal and postneonatal therapy, problems faced with phototherapy, liver
      transplantation, current growth status, current neurologic status, and the status
      of hearing. Patients were between 2 months and 21 years of age. There were 18
      males and 24 females. Thirty-nine patients had been born at full term gestation
      and 3 had been preterm. Jaundice was noted on postnatal day 1 in 34%, between
      days 2 and 4 in 55%, and after day 11 of life in 11% of patients. In the neonatal
      period bilirubin values (mean +/- SD) were typically 19.8 +/- 4.5 mg/dL.
      Eighty-six percent of patients had neonatal peak bilirubin values of >20 mg/dL.
      Parental consanguinity was present in 44% and a history of Gilbert's disease in
      one parent was present in 10% of patients. Causes of exacerbations of jaundice
      reported were respiratory infections, febrile illnesses, vaccinations, fasting,
      surgery, emotional stress, and noncompliance with treatment. Neonatal therapy
      consisted of exchange transfusion in 28%, phototherapy in 79%, phenobarbitone in 
      20%, and cholestyramine, albumin, infusions, and plasmapheresis in one case each.
      The mainstay of postneonatal therapy was home phototherapy for 10 to 16 hours,
      primarily at night during sleep, using blue lights or a combination of blue and
      fluorescent lights. Some patients used innovatively designed phototherapy units. 
      Problems reported with phototherapy were decreased effectiveness with age, poor
      compliance, restriction of activity and play, inability to travel or take
      vacations, irritation from eye shades, difficulty keeping eye protection on,
      difficulties in temperature maintenance, tanning of the skin, embarrassment from 
      the need to be nearly nude during phototherapy, and difficulty in procuring
      phototherapy lamps. Other therapies that had been tried included oral agar,
      albumin infusions, antioxidants, acupuncture, bilirubin oxidase, calcium
      infusions, clofibrate, cruciferous vegetables, cholestyramine, chlorpromazine,
      flumecinol, plasmapheresis, tin mesoporphyrin, ursodeoxycholic acid, and urinary 
      alkalinization. Fifteen children had undergone liver transplantation (5 auxiliary
      and 10 orthotopic). All 42 patients are reportedly of normal height and weight.
      Neurodevelopmental status is said to be normal in 77% of patients. Two patients
      have kernicterus, 4 have cerebellar symptoms, and 1 each has developmental delay,
      mild intention tremor, and mild speech delay. Hearing was reported to be normal
      in 94% of patients. The 2 children with hearing loss have conductive loss from
      otitis media. With home phototherapy prolonged, survival free of neurologic
      deficits is possible in Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1, but there are many
      problems associated with phototherapy. Avoiding exacerbations of jaundice is an
      important aspect of management. Liver transplantation offers the prospect of cure
      but its risk versus benefit ratio is undetermined. Hearing loss was absent in the
      patients surveyed despite prolonged exposure to high bilirubin levels, which
      suggests that bilirubin may not be as ototoxic as is commonly believed.

TI  - An Australian study of functional status after childbirth.
PG  - 172-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify key predictive variables of functional status after
      childbirth. DESIGN: An investigative survey design. SETTING: Primary health care 
      maternal child health centres in one large city in Victoria, Australia.
      PARTICIPANTS: 200 mothers selected from a culturally diverse population. All were
      aged 20 to 35 years, had experienced normal pregnancies, labours, deliveries and 
      delivered a healthy baby between 37 and 42 weeks' gestation. MEASURES AND
      FINDINGS: The Inventory of Functional Status After Childbirth (IFSAC) (Fawcett
      Tulman & Myers 1988) was used as the main outcome measure. Three variables
      predictive of functional status after childbirth were identified, namely,
      satisfaction with level of stamina and well-being, sleep pattern at night and
      perceived lack of support following childbirth. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Return to full
      functional status as measured by IFSAC takes longer than physiological recovery
      after childbirth. Women who experience diminished well-being, interrupted sleep
      patterns and lacked support, appeared to be at greater risk of role congestion,
      overload and dysfunction. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: To help women avoid the
      additive nature of assuming the motherhood role while also resuming past role
      responsibilities, practitioners could encourage pregnant women to develop a
      postnatal support plan. Women need to be proactive in negotiating specific and
      ongoing support from others with household responsibilities and some aspects of
      baby care.

TI  - Periodic fetal heart rate decelerations during 6 hours' hypoxemia induced in
      goats.
PG  - 75-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if fetal heart rate (FHR) decelerations periodically
      occur with uterine contractures during 6 hours' induced hypoxemia in goats.
      METHODS: In five chronically catheterized goat fetuses at 125-130 days'
      gestation, incidence of FHR decelerations was compared between 6 hours' control
      time and 6 hours' induced hypoxemia with two-way ANOVA and Duncan's multiple
      range test. Three other fetuses were used as controls for circadian rhythm.
      RESULTS: Fetal PaO2 was significantly decreased from 26.1 to 16.3 mmHg without
      acidemia. During hypoxemia, 42 decelerations were induced along with 5 initial
      decelerations during the acute phase hypoxemia. Incidence of decelerations
      increased significantly from 0.07 +/- 0.15 per hour in 6-hour controls to 1.40
      +/- 0.28 per hour during 6 hours' induced hypoxemia. Short-term variability and
      long-term variability of the 42 decelerations were significantly increased. These
      variabilities were also increased during the 5 initial decelerations. Frequency
      of uterine contractures did not change during hypoxemia. There was an observable 
      association of FHR decelerations with uterine contractures during hypoxemia.
      CONCLUSION: Fetal heart rate decelerations occurred periodically in association
      with uterine contractures during induced 6 hours' hypoxemia, which were
      characterized by slow onset and recovery with increases in variability.

TI  - [Health status of the population in the vicinity of a waste recycling plant in
      Mexico].
PG  - 15-20
AB  - This study was conducted in Mexico among residents of an area near a recycling
      plant for zinc and other metallic dusts to find out if these substances produce
      various adverse health effects in the population that may come in contact with
      them. The plant is in a municipality close to Monterrey, which is Mexico's third 
      most populous and second most industrialized city. A cross-sectional comparative 
      design was used for the research, which took place from September to November
      1994. By means of quota sampling, houses were selected in two areas--one exposed,
      by virtue of its proximity to the plant, and the other unexposed, which served as
      a control--until the desired sample size was reached (621 individuals, an average
      of five per household). In each dwelling, a trained psychology student
      administered a questionnaire to one of the older family members to gather data on
      the presence of acute and chronic illnesses, problems during pregnancy, and
      congenital illnesses among the household members. In the exposed population, 127 
      questionnaires were completed, providing information on 596 persons; in the
      unexposed population, data on 743 persons were gathered via 147 questionnaires.
      The sex and age distributions were similar in the two populations, and the length
      of residence in their respective area was slightly longer among unexposed
      individuals. The most frequently reported health problems in the exposed
      population were irritation of the eyes and upper respiratory tract, allergies,
      sleep disturbances, bronchitis, fatigue, skin problems, ear infections, and
      anemia. The prevalence ratios for the exposed versus unexposed populations were
      significant with regard to skin eruptions and other skin diseases, fatigue, sleep
      disturbances, upper respiratory infections, ear infections, bronchitis, and
      allergies. Women from the two groups did not show significant differences in the 
      prevalence of obstetric problems, miscarriages, or children born with congenital 
      deformities or low birthweight. The sensitivity of the questionnaire used to
      detect health problems was poor, which could have resulted in an underestimation 
      of some disorders. Nevertheless, various types of information bias were
      controlled, permitting the conclusion that the exposed population had a greater
      risk of suffering certain diseases and disorders than the unexposed population.

TI  - Urine production rate and renal blood flow in the near-term ovine fetus are not
      related to high and low voltage electrocortical activity.
PG  - 121-5
AB  - Studies in both the human and ovine near-term fetus have identified the
      clustering of physiologic and behavioral parameters into states. In a recent
      study in the human fetus a considerable decrease was found in fetal urine
      production during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) compared with REM sleep.
      Whether this decrease was caused by decreased renal blood flow or changes in
      urine concentration is not known. This prompted us to investigate the relation
      between fetal urine production rate and electrocortical activity in the near-term
      ovine fetus. We hypothesized that in the ovine fetus urine production and renal
      blood flow during REM [comparable to low voltage electrocortical activity (LV
      ECoG)] would be lower than during non-REM [(high voltage (HV) ECoG)]. In eight
      fetal sheep between 123 and 127 d of gestation (term 147 d), ECoG, renal blood
      flow, urine flow, and urine osmolality were measured continuously for 6 h on 2
      consecutive days. Data were analyzed into HV ECoG and LV ECoG whereafter urine
      flow, urine osmolality, and renal blood flow data were averaged per state. We
      found no significant differences in urine flow, urine osmolality, or renal blood 
      flow between the two behavioral states in the ovine fetus. Because these data are
      in sharp contrast to those found in the human fetus, we conclude that the
      observed dissimilarities in renal responses between the human and sheep fetus add
      to the already known differences in behavioral states between the two species.

TI  - Plasma aldosterone concentration of cats.
PG  - 63-8
AB  - Aldosterone concentrations in the plasma of specific-pathogen-free, domestic,
      short-hair cats given sodium replete diets were measured by a radio-immunoassay. 
      Plasma samples assayed were taken from male and female cats of 8, 12, 17, 20, 26,
      29, 40 and > 52 weeks of age, from adult non-pregnant queens, and from queens in 
      the ninth weeks of pregnancy and in the second and fifth week of lactation.
      Plasma aldosterone concentration was also measured in samples taken four times
      over a 24 h period (06:00-06:30, 11:00-11:30, 17:00-17:30 and 23:00-23:30) in a
      group of seven adult male cats. neither age nor sex had a significant effect on
      the plasma aldosterone concentration. Also, queens had similar aldosterone
      concentrations in plasma whether they were non-pregnant, pregnant, or lactating. 
      No circadian rhythm was observed in plasma aldosterone concentrations in adult
      male cats. The plasma aldosterone concentrations of 148 cats (87 males and 61
      females, ranging in ages from 8 to > 52 weeks) had a positive skew distribution
      with a median of 161 pmol l-1. The upper value for plasma aldosterone
      concentration in healthy domestic cats as defined by the 95 percentile was 700
      pmol l-1.

TI  - Low-level exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields: health effects and
      research needs.
PG  - 1-19
AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO), the International Commission on Non-Ionizing
      Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), and the German and Austrian Governments jointly
      sponsored an international seminar in November of 1996 on the biological effects 
      of low-level radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields. For purposes of this
      seminar, RF fields having frequencies only in the range of about 10 MHz to 300
      GHz were considered. This is one of a series of scientific review seminars held
      under the International Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Project to identify any
      health hazards from EMF exposure. The scientific literature was reviewed during
      the seminar and expert working groups formed to provide a status report on
      possible health effects from exposure to low-level RF fields and identify gaps in
      knowledge requiring more research to improve health risk assessments. It was
      concluded that, although hazards from exposure to high-level (thermal) RF fields 
      were established, no known health hazards were associated with exposure to RF
      sources emitting fields too low to cause a significant temperature rise in
      tissue. Biological effects from low-level RF exposure were identified needing
      replication and further study. These included in vitro studies of cell kinetics
      and proliferation effects, effects on genes, signal transduction effects and
      alterations in membrane structure and function, and biophysical and biochemical
      mechanisms for RF field effects. In vivo studies should focus on the potential
      for cancer promotion, co-promotion and progression, as well as possible
      synergistic, genotoxic, immunological, and carcinogenic effects associated with
      chronic low-level RF exposure. Research is needed to determine whether low-level 
      RF exposure causes DNA damage or influences central nervous system function,
      melatonin synthesis, permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB), or reaction
      to neurotropic drugs. Reported RF-induced changes to eye structure and function
      should also be investigated. Epidemiological studies should investigate: the use 
      of mobile telephones with hand-held antennae and incidence of various cancers;
      reports of headache, sleep disturbance, and other subjective effects that may
      arise from proximity to RF emitters, and laboratory studies should be conducted
      on people reporting these effects; cohorts with high occupational RF exposure for
      changes in cancer incidence; adverse pregnancy outcomes in various highly RF
      exposed occupational groups; and ocular pathologies in mobile telephone users and
      in highly RF exposed occupational groups. Studies of populations with residential
      exposure from point sources, such as broadcasting transmitters or mobile
      telephone base stations have caused widespread health concerns among the public, 
      even though RF exposures are very low. Recent studies that may indicate an
      increased incidence of cancer in exposed populations should be investigated
      further.

TI  - Current and birth weights exert independent influences on nocturnal
      pressure-natriuresis relationships in normotensive children.
PG  - 546-51
AB  - The objective was to study the impact of birth weight on the relationship between
      ambulatory blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion in children and
      adolescents. The study included 134 healthy children (61 boys), all Caucasians,
      who were born at term after a normotensive pregnancy. For each subject, a 24-hour
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and a complete urine collection were
      simultaneously performed according to the protocols designed. Average ambulatory 
      blood pressure (BP) and the urinary excretion rates for sodium, potassium, and
      creatinine were calculated separately for 24-hour, awake, and sleep periods
      defined by a mini-diary. The excretion rate of sodium during sleep time was
      positively correlated with ambulatory systolic BP; such a positive relationship
      was not found for waking hours. Consequently, the impact of birth weight on the
      relationship between blood pressure and the urinary sodium excretion rate was
      analyzed during sleeping hours. Stepwise multiple regression analysis shows that 
      although current weight was the strongest predictor for the sodium excretion rate
      during sleep (P<.001), there was also an independent significant direct
      relationship for birth weight (P<.04) after controlling for age, sex, and the
      average of systolic BP during sleep. Adjusted for current weight, a significant
      difference in the regression slopes relating urinary sodium excretion rate and
      systolic BP during sleep exists between children in the lowest (<3.100 kg) and
      the highest tertiles (>3.500 kg) of birth weight (P<.02). Differences in sodium
      excretion rates, adjusted for current weight, between the two extreme tertiles of
      birth weight became significant at the highest systolic BP (P<.04). The children 
      who had the lowest birth weight tended to excrete less sodium during sleep. The
      results of the present study show a blunted pressure natriuresis curve in
      children and adolescents with the lowest birth weight. Whether this abnormal
      renal sodium handling may be present as an initial or as an intermediate
      mechanism leading to higher BP values must be assessed in additional studies.

      Development in the first 18 months. ALSPAC Study Team.
PG  - E5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the recommendations that infants sleep supine could 
      have adverse consequences on their motor and mental development. DESIGN: A
      prospective study of infants, delivered before, during, and after the Back to
      Sleep Campaign in the United Kingdom, followed to 18 months of age. SUBJECTS: The
      children were participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and
      Childhood born to mothers resident in the three former Bristol-based health
      districts of Avon, with expected date of delivery from April 1, 1991 to December 
      31, 1992. Questionnaires were completed on sleeping position at 4 to 6 weeks of
      age and sets of standardized questions on development at 6 and 18 months. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Social, communication, fine and gross motor, and total
      developmental scales based on the Denver Developmental Screening Test at 6 and 18
      months. RESULTS: After adjustment for 27 factors using multiple regression, 3 of 
      the 10 scales and subscales significantly distinguished between front and back
      sleeping position. At 6 months of age, infants put to sleep on their front had a 
      mean score 0.38 SD (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28, 0.49) higher on the gross
      motor scale, 0.11 SD (95% CI: 0.00, 0.23) higher in the social skills scale, and 
      a total development score 0.20 SD (95% CI: 0.10, 0.30) higher than those on their
      backs. These differences were no longer apparent at 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: There
      is some evidence that putting infants to sleep in the supine position results in 
      a reduced developmental score at 6 months of age, but this disadvantage appears
      to be transient. Weighing this against the adverse health effects demonstrated
      with the prone sleeping position, these results should not change the message of 
      the Back to Sleep Campaign.

TI  - Melatonin: role in development.
PG  - 498-508
AB  - Melatonin is the mammalian fetus's window to periodicity of the outside world.
      Through melatonin, the fetus "knows" what time of year it is and, in all
      likelihood, also knows the time of day. The best known function of melatonin
      during development is to communicate information about photoperiod and thereby
      adaptively regulate reproductive development. A second likely function of
      melatonin during development, which may be related to but more widespread than
      the first, is to entrain the developing circadian pacemaker. Prenatal maternal
      entrainment occurs in all of the eutherian mammals in which it has been examined,
      and in Syrian hamsters exogenous melatonin during development causes entrainment.
      The broader distribution and greater abundance of melatonin receptors during
      development, relative to mature animals, suggests that developmental effects of
      melatonin are greater and more diverse. The human fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus
      expresses melatonin binding sites and is therefore likely to be affected by both 
      endogenous and exogenous melatonin with consequences for the prenatal and
      postnatal expression and entrainment of circadian rhythms. Caution is warranted, 
      not only concerning the use of exogenous melatonin during pregnancy and lactation
      but also concerning behavior that might disrupt the mother's endogenous melatonin
      rhythm.

TI  - [Physiology and action of prolactin].
PG  - 2871-5
AB  - Prolactin (PRL) is a peptide hormone secreted by the lactotroph of the anterior
      pituitary. Secretion of PRL is regulated negatively by hypothalamic hormone.
      Dopamine is the major physiologic prolactin inhibiting factor (PIF). PRFs as TRH,
      VIP and oxytosin have prolactin releasing activity. Prolactin secretion is
      induced by sleep, stress, sexual intercourse and suckling stimulus. Serum level
      of PRL is increased by estrogen. Therefore, PRL level is higher in women,
      especially in the late follicular phase and during pregnancy. Lactation is the
      major biologic function of PRL in humans and essential to reproduction. Other
      function of PRL, such as regulation of ovarian function, osmoregulation and
      immunoregulation is not fully established. Many action of PRL remained to be
      clarified.

TI  - D1 receptors mediate dopamine action in the fetal suprachiasmatic nuclei: studies
      of mice with targeted deletion of the D1 dopamine receptor gene.
PG  - 271-7
AB  - Studies in rodents suggest the presence of a dopaminergic system that influences 
      the function of a biological clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei
      (SCN). To provide insights into mechanisms of dopamine action in the SCN, we
      studied transgenic mice that had either one allele (+ inverted question mark-) or
      both alleles (-/-) of the D1 dopamine receptor gene deleted, along with normal
      (+/+) littermates. As expected, receptor labelling autoradiography studies using 
      [125I]SCH 23982 showed a complete absence of D1 dopamine receptor binding sites
      in the SCN of -/- animals. When pregnant mice from + inverted question mark- x + 
      inverted question mark- matings were injected with the D1 receptor agonist SKF
      38393, or the dopamine reuptake blocker GBR 12909 at day 19 of gestation, c-fos
      mRNA expression was observed in the SCN of +/+ fetuses. In contrast, c-fos mRNA
      induction was not seen in -/- or + inverted question mark- litter mates.
      Injection of cocaine into pregnant dams also resulted in robust SCN c-fos mRNA
      expression in +/+ mice. Increases in SCN c-fos mRNA expression were also seen in 
      + inverted question mark- and -/- mice suggesting that cocaine action in the SCN 
      involves both D1 receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Collectively,
      our studies of transgenic mice deficient in D1 receptors support the presence of 
      a functional dopaminergic system in the fetal SCN. We also identify D1 receptors 
      as the prominent transducer of dopamine action in the fetal SCN.

TI  - Circadian blood pressure variability in healthy and complicated pregnancies.
PG  - 603-10
AB  - With the aim to describe the circadian pattern of noninvasive ambulatorily
      monitored blood pressure during the trimesters of pregnancy in clinically healthy
      women as well as in pregnant women who developed gestational hypertension or
      preeclampsia, we analyzed 759 blood pressure series sampled by ambulatory
      monitoring for about 48 hours every 4 weeks after the first obstetric visit in 71
      women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 28 with gestational hypertension, and 14
      with preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of blood pressure variation for each
      group (complicated versus uncomplicated pregnancies) and trimester of gestation
      was established by linear least-squares methods. A highly statistically circadian
      pattern is demonstrated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure for both groups
      of pregnant women in all trimesters (P<.001 in all cases). Blood pressure
      decreases from the first trimester to the second and rises again in the third for
      healthy pregnant women. For women who developed gestational hypertension or
      preeclampsia, blood pressure is stable during the first half of pregnancy and
      then continuously increases until delivery. The differences in circadian
      rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly
      statistically significant in all trimesters (always P<.001). This study confirms 
      and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable circadian
      variability in blood pressure during gestation. The differences in blood pressure
      between healthy and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as the first
      trimester of pregnancy. Those differences are found when both systolic and
      diastolic blood pressures for women with a later diagnosis of gestational
      hypertension or preeclampsia are well within the accepted normal physiological
      range of blood pressure variability.

TI  - Combined effects of sleeping position and prenatal risk factors in sudden infant 
      death syndrome: the Nordic Epidemiological SIDS Study.
PG  - 613-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prone sleeping is a strong risk factor for sudden infant death
      syndrome (SIDS). We investigated whether the combined effect of prone sleeping
      position and prenatal risk factors further increased the SIDS risk. METHODS: In
      the Nordic Epidemiological SIDS Study, parents of SIDS victims in Denmark,
      Norway, and Sweden completed a questionnaire on potential risk factors for SIDS. 
      Forensic pathologists verified the SIDS diagnosis. Four controls of the same
      gender, age, and place of birth were selected. This matched case-control study,
      which included 244 SIDS cases and 869 controls from 1992 to 1995, was analyzed by
      conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Odds ratios (ORs) for prone and side
      sleeping compared with supine sleeping for the last sleep were 13.9 (95%
      confidence interval 8.2-24) and 3.5 (2.1-5.7). Infants 13 to 24 weeks old had
      particularly high risk in prone and side sleeping, at 28.5 (7.9-107) and 5.9
      (1.6-22). OR for prone sleeping was higher in girls, at 30.4 (11-88), than in
      boys, 10.3 (5.5-19). We found strong combined effects of sleeping position and
      prenatal risk factors (more than multiplicative). The OR for prone and side
      sleeping was increased for infants with birth weight <2500 g, at 83 (25-276) and 
      36.6 (13-107); for preterm infants, at 48.8 (19-128) and 40.5 (14-115); and for
      intrauterine growth retarded, at 38.8 (14-108) and 9.6 (4.3-22), compared with
      supine position in infants without these prenatal factors. The combined effect of
      nonsupine positions and intrauterine growth retarded was highest among 13- to
      24-week-old infants. Effects of combined presence of nonsupine sleeping positions
      and each of the factors of smoking in pregnancy, young maternal age, higher
      parity, low level of maternal education, and single motherhood were more than
      additive. Attributable fractions in the population for prone and side sleeping
      were 18.5% and 26.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Both prone and side sleeping increased the
      risk of SIDS. The risk was increased further in low birth weight infants, preterm
      infants, and infants at the age of 13 to 24 weeks, suggesting that SIDS may be
      triggered by nonsupine sleeping in infants with prenatal risk factors during a
      vulnerable period of postnatal development.

TI  - Maternal and fetal implications of anticonvulsive therapy during pregnancy.
PG  - 523-34
AB  - A team approach with close communication among the obstetrician, neurologist,
      pediatrician, and patient will result in an uneventful pregnancy in most
      epileptic women. Women should be counseled regarding the greater than 90%
      likelihood of a favorable outcome. Maternal and neonatal outcome can be optimized
      by carefully evaluating the clinical necessity of anticonvulsant medications
      preconceptionally. One can then prescribe an appropriate choice based on seizure 
      type and history of response, with a goal of achieving monotherapy at the lowest 
      effective dose. Nonpharmacologic intervention, such as avoiding high levels of
      stress and sleep deprivation, will also help the patient to remain seizure-free
      during the pregnancy. In addition, folic acid and vitamin K can help optimize
      neonatal outcome. In short, most epileptic women will experience a normal
      pregnancy, labor, and delivery of a healthy baby and can breastfeed if desired.
      Although the incidence of congenital malformations with any anticonvulsant is
      increased, the actual incidence remains relatively low. Despite the shortcomings 
      and risks of anticonvulsants, adequate therapy is clearly preferable to
      uncontrolled seizure activity. Women should be encouraged to optimize their
      anticonvulsive therapy prior to pregnancy, usually resulting in adequate therapy 
      throughout the pregnancy and postpartum, with a happy and healthy outcome for
      mother and infant.

TI  - Oestrogens and psychological well-being.
PG  - 283-90
AB  - The last decade has seen increased interest in the role of hormones, including
      oestrogens, not only in regulating growth, sexual development and reproduction
      but in maintaining a sense of psychological well-being. Episodes of change in
      oestrogen levels, whether increasing or decreasing, are high-risk periods for the
      emergence of psychological symptoms in some women. This may be due to a 'kindling
      effect' for women with previous psychological disturbance, an effect on circadian
      rhythm activity and therefore altered neurovegetative functions, or an effect on 
      central rhythmic functioning between the hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex,
      all mediated by effects on neurotransmitter systems. Data supporting these
      hypotheses come from animal studies as well as converging research in several
      areas including the study of psychological side-effects of oral contraceptives,
      the study of mood and cognitive disturbances related to the menstrual cycle, the 
      studies of states of hormonal change such as pregnancy and the menopause and, of 
      course, studies of women with psychiatric disorders such as major depression,
      seasonal affective disorder and dementia. Improvement in such symptoms via
      hormonal therapies or other interventions will probably lead to better quality of
      life for women and may actually impede the deterioration associated with ageing
      and certain medical illnesses. Current data support a relationship between
      oestrogen and psychological well-being.

TI  - [Sleep during post-partum depression].
PG  - 262-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have been published on postnatal depression (PND)
      over the last 10 years. A controversy has arisen regarding the specificity of the
      diagnostic concept. It is based on 2 points: the hormonal environment and the
      course and recurrence of PND. EEG Sleep studies are also numerous, but this paper
      presents the first study on EEG sleep profile during PND. METHODS: 24 women
      suffering from major depression according to RDC were placed in 3 groups: 1)
      Group A (n = 8): PND; 2) Group B (n = 8): depression with a past history of PND; 
      3) Group C (n = 8): depression without a past history of PND. Women were
      age-matched and according to the Hamilton 24 item severity score. Group A
      patients were delivered within less that 6 months, groups B and C within a
      minimum of 3 years. None were pregnant or alcoholic, and none were physically
      ill. RESULTS: There was no difference between groups B and C. Group A was
      characterised by a significantly longer stage IV sleep. There was also a strong
      tendency to a shorter stage I sleep and a better quality of sleep (total sleep
      time and number of awakenings) during PND. DISCUSSION: Our study shows that, even
      if similar to major depression, specific polysomnographic alteration can be found
      during post-partum depression. This finding is relevant to the hypothesis of
      PND's diagnostic specificity. The perfect similarity between groups B and C
      strengthens this evidence. Nevertheless, the significance of SWS alterations are 
      difficult to explain and additional studies are required. CONCLUSION: The EEG
      Sleep profile during PND differs from major depression of the same severity. This
      appears to favour the specificity of the diagnostic concept.

AB  - We studied 142 preterm infants (mean gestation 31 weeks, mean birthweight 1364 g)
      fed prospectively varied protein and energy intakes. Infants were grouped as
      either slow or rapid growers based on rate of weight gain. Rapid growers had
      increased heart rates (166 vs 160 beats/min), respiratory rates (55.7 vs 53.9
      bpm), energy expenditure (64.8 vs 61.6 kcal kg(-1) day(-1)), urinary C-peptide
      levels (1.59 vs 0.79 ng ml(-1)) and time in active sleep (78.0 vs 75.2%), and
      decreased spectral edge frequency in the electroencephalogram (2.96 vs 4.45 Hz)
      compared to slow growers. We conclude that preterm infants growing at varying
      rates manifest physiological and behavioral differences, and that these patterns 
      may reflect altered autonomic balance.

PG  - 825-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine frequency domain measures of heart rate variability and
      their circadian rhythms in pregnancy. DESIGN: A longitudinal study. SETTING:
      University hospital in Turku, Finland. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen healthy women
      between 11 and 27 weeks of pregnancy; 12 women before pregnancy; and four women
      postpartum. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Heart rate variability as measured in
      frequency domain from 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography. RESULTS: Pregnancy 
      was associated with a lower standard deviation of R-R intervals (P < 0.01), with 
      reduced very low (P < 0.05), low (P < 0.01), and high frequency (P < 0.05) power 
      spectral components of heart rate variability. The high frequency power was lower
      at night in pregnancy, but similar in the daytime in pregnant and nonpregnant
      women. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy is associated with an overall reduction in heart
      rate variability, most markedly reflected in the low frequency component. This
      suggests altered baroreflex or sympathetic modulation of heart rate, and
      decreased vagal activation at night.

PG  - E11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the recommendations that infants sleep supine could 
      have adverse health consequences. DESIGN: A prospective study of infants,
      delivered before, during, and after the Back to Sleep Campaign in the United
      Kingdom (UK), followed to 6 months of age. The children were part of the Avon
      Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC). Subjects. Singletons born
      to mothers resident in the three former Bristol-based health districts of Avon in
      the period June 1991 to December 1992, and for whom questionnaires were completed
      on sleeping position at 4 to 6 weeks of age (n = 9777); for these infants 8524
      questionnaires were also completed at 6 to 8 months of age. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Subjective measures of health, the presence of specific signs and
      symptoms, duration of sleep at night, and calling the family doctor to the home. 
      RESULTS: Of 43 outcomes considered, after adjustment for 12 factors using
      logistic regression only 2 were associated with raised risk among infants put to 
      sleep on their back (diaper rash and cradle cap). Infants put to sleep prone had 
      increased risk of a number of health outcomes, including cough and possibly
      pyrexia. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that putting infants to sleep in the
      supine position results in increased morbidity, although changes in prevalence of
      rare disorders would not have been identified.

TI  - Social ties and susceptibility to the common cold.
PG  - 1940-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the hypothesis that diverse ties to friends, family, work, 
      and community are associated with increased host resistance to infection. DESIGN:
      After reporting the extent of participation in 12 types of social ties (eg,
      spouse, parent, friend, workmate, member of social group), subjects were given
      nasal drops containing 1 of 2 rhinoviruses and monitored for the development of a
      common cold. SETTING: Quarantine. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 276 healthy
      volunteers, aged 18 to 55 years, neither seropositive for human immunodeficiency 
      virus nor pregnant. OUTCOME MEASURES: Colds (illness in the presence of a
      verified infection), mucus production, mucociliary clearance function, and amount
      of viral replication. RESULTS: In response to both viruses, those with more types
      of social ties were less susceptible to common colds, produced less mucus, were
      more effective in ciliary clearance of their nasal passages, and shed less virus.
      These relationships were unaltered by statistical controls for prechallenge
      virus-specific antibody, virus type, age, sex, season, body mass index,
      education, and race. Susceptibility to colds decreased in a dose-response manner 
      with increased diversity of the social network. There was an adjusted relative
      risk of 4.2 comparing persons with fewest (1 to 3) to those with most (6 or more)
      types of social ties. Although smoking, poor sleep quality, alcohol abstinence,
      low dietary intake of vitamin C, elevated catecholamine levels, and being
      introverted were all associated with greater susceptibility to colds, they could 
      only partially account for the relation between social network diversity and
      incidence of colds. CONCLUSIONS: More diverse social networks were associated
      with greater resistance to upper respiratory illness.

TI  - Episodic variations of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing
      hormone, melatonin and cortisol in infertile women with subclinical
      hypothyroidism.
PG  - 896-904
AB  - Preliminary data have suggested that female infertility due to corpus luteum
      insufficiency may be caused by subclinical hypothyroidism [exaggerated
      thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) response to thyrotrophin-releasing hormone
      (TRH) stimulation]. L-Thyroxine supplementation has been recommended to achieve
      pregnancies in subclinical hypothyroid women. This controlled study was carried
      out in order to investigate the biochemical diagnosis of subclinical
      hypothyroidism as a possible infertility factor. Five infertile patients (aged
      25-36 years) with subclinical hypothyroidism (n = 4, stimulated TSH >20
      microU/ml) or primary hypothyroidism (n = 1) and five healthy controls (aged
      22-39 years) with normal thyroid function (stimulated TSH <15 microU/ml), regular
      cycles and no history of infertility were studied in the early follicular phase. 
      In the pre-study evaluation, eight of 23 volunteers (34.8%) had to be excluded
      because of subclinical hypothyroidism with stimulated TSH values (TSHs) >15
      microU/ml. Cycle function of patients and controls was compared by the method of 
      LH pulse pattern analysis. Therefore blood samples were drawn every 10 min during
      a 24 h period. Sleep was recorded from midnight to 7 a.m. Repetition of the TRH
      tests at the end of the 24 h blood sampling period confirmed the difference in
      stimulated TSH values of the two study groups. Pulse analysis for luteinizing
      hormone (LH), TSH and prolactin showed no differences between patients and
      controls for pulse frequency, amplitude, height, length, area under curve (AUC)
      and the 24 h mean. Even the hypothyroid patient had a normal LH pulse pattern.
      Additional measurement of melatonin in pooled sera every 30 min gave the
      well-documented diurnal profiles during day and night for both groups. Patients
      had significantly higher melatonin values at seven time points during the night. 
      Peaks for LH, TSH, prolactin and cortisol were correlated with the sleep stages
      wake, rapid eye movement, 1 + 2 and 3 + 4. We concluded that corpus luteum
      insufficiency in female infertility cannot be explained by subclinical
      hypothyroidism and thus should not be treated with L-thyroxine for fertility
      reasons.

TI  - Time off work and the postpartum health of employed women.
PG  - 507-21
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Parental and maternity leave policies are a popular fringe benefit
      among childbearing employed women and a benefit employers frequently are required
      to offer. However, few rigorous evaluations of the effect of maternal leave on
      maternal health exist. METHODS: Using a hybrid of the household and health
      production theories of Becker and Grossman and a sample of women identified from 
      state vital statistics records, a nonlinear relationship between maternal
      postpartum health and time off work after childbirth was estimated. RESULTS: For 
      women taking more than 12 weeks leave, time off work had a positive effect on
      vitality. With more than 15 weeks leave, time off work had a positive effect on
      maternal, mental health, and with more than 20 weeks leave, time off work had a
      positive effect on role function. Subjects' mental health scores were comparable 
      and vitality scores slightly lower than age- and gender-specific norms; 70% of
      women studied reported role function limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest
      employed women experience problems in well-being at approximately seven months
      postpartum. Variables associated with improved health include: longer maternity
      leaves, fewer prenatal mental health symptoms, fewer concurrent physical
      symptoms, more sleep, increased social support, increased job satisfaction, less 
      physical exertion on the job, fewer infant symptoms, and less difficulty
      arranging child care.

TI  - Single prenatal injections of melatonin or the D1-dopamine receptor agonist SKF
      38393 to pregnant hamsters sets the offsprings' circadian rhythms to phases 180
      degrees apart.
PG  - 339-46
AB  - Pregnant Syrian hamsters with lesions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
      received single injections of melatonin or the D1-dopamine receptor agonist, SKF 
      38393 on day 15 of gestation (1 day before birth). Pups were weaned on postnatal 
      day 20 and their freerunning activity rhythms recorded for 3-4 weeks. The pups'
      phases on the day of weaning were significantly clustered in both of the
      treatment groups, but the average phases differed by approximately 180 degrees.
      The results demonstrate that a single prenatal stimulus is sufficient to set the 
      phases of the hamsters' rhythms and that the phase established depends on the
      stimulus. Both c-fos mRNA and Fos protein were expressed in the fetal SCN after
      SKF 38393 injection but neither were expressed after melatonin injection.
      Simulations showed that a single stimulus could produce the observed synchrony
      from a population of uniformally distributed phases if the phase shifts were
      three to four times the magnitude of the adult hamster light phase response curve
      (PRC). A light pulse PRC mimicked the effect of an SKF 38393 injection and a
      dark-pulse PRC mimicked the effects of a melatonin injection. Together these
      results suggest that dopamine and melatonin either are, or mimic, maternal
      entraining signals that represent day and night.

TI  - Expectant parents' experience with fatigue and sleep during pregnancy.
PG  - 49-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although both expectant mothers and expectant fathers complain of
      fatigue during the last trimester of pregnancy, studies have focused exclusively 
      on mothers. This pilot study examined parents' levels of morning or evening
      fatigue, number of uninterrupted sleep periods and length of sleep during the
      last trimester of pregnancy; and the relationship of sleep to parents' reports of
      fatigue. METHODS: Data were collected from 24 midwestern, nulliparous couples,
      who completed the Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue each morning and each evening
      on 4 consecutive days during the last trimester. Concurrently, the couples
      recorded sleep and wake periods in an activity diary. RESULTS: Expectant mothers 
      but not expectant fathers reported increasing levels of fatigue, especially
      morning fatigue, as the pregnancy progressed. Expectant fathers and mothers did
      not differ either in the night-time mean number of minutes of sleep obtained, or 
      in the mean number of night-time uninterrupted 90-minute sleep cycles obtained.
      Fatigue and sleep were not significantly related for either mothers or fathers.
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the multidimensional nature of fatigue and
      indicate a need for perinatal health caregivers to develop individualized
      interventions for mothers during the last trimester of pregnancy. Fathers should 
      also participate in future research of factors influencing the prenatal and
      postpartum experience.

TI  - [Management of drug addict pregnant women and their children].
PG  - 263-70
AB  - Children of substance abuse mothers have an increased risk of severe pathological
      disorders such as perinatal diseases (prematurity, intrauterine growth
      retardation, infections) with their neurological and respiratory complications
      and sequelae, and transmission of drug addiction related infections, ie human
      immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C virus, syphilis. Many of these children
      present a drug withdrawal syndrome characterized by restlessness and jetteriness 
      during the neonatal period. This is frequently followed by a post withdrawal
      period of several weeks duration with crying, excitement, sleep and feeding
      difficulties. Although these drug withdrawal manifestations have no incidence on 
      the vital prognosis, it severely impairs the mother-infant interaction. Despite
      these disorders it appears that the outcome of these children is mainly related
      to their familial environment which is exposed to many risk factors: mother-child
      separation, violence, delinquency, precariousness, unhealthy housing,
      prostitution, drug dependency, parental death or imprisonment... Early
      medico-psycho-social intervention starting during pregnancy and a prolonged
      support for several years are the only way to improve their spontaneously poor
      outcome.

AB  - With close cooperation and communication among the obstetrician, neurologist,
      pediatrician, and patient, most women with idiopathic epilepsy who become
      pregnant will have an uneventful pregnancy with an excellent outcome. To optimize
      the neonatal outcome in a patient requiring medication, using a single drug at
      the lowest possible dose that keeps her free of seizures is preferable. The
      prevention of tonic-clonic seizures, however, is of utmost importance. Simple
      interventions such as avoiding sleep deprivation, having the patients take folic 
      acid before conception, and giving the infant a vitamin K injection at birth will
      help optimize the outcome. There is an increase of congenital malformations in
      infants born to women with epilepsy; however, the incidence is low. Most women
      with epilepsy will experience normal pregnancy and labor and will have
      spontaneous vaginal deliveries of healthy babies.

TI  - Treatment of circadian rhythm disorders--melatonin.
PG  - 185-204
AB  - Melatonin has clear acute and delayed effects on sleep and circadian rhythms.
      Decrements in core temperature and alertness have been found at different times
      of day following low pharmacological and physiological doses of melatonin. When
      correctly timed, melatonin induces both phase advances and phase delays of the
      circadian system in humans. When timed to advance, the decrement in temperature
      and alertness and the degree of shift are closely related to dose. In both
      simulation and field studies, correctly timed melatonin can alleviate some of the
      problems of shiftwork and jet lag, notably enhancing sleep and alertness and
      hastening adaptation of rhythms to the imposed schedule. Performance effects and 
      changes in sleep architecture need to be fully evaluated. The optimization of
      dose and formulation is also an area that requires further work. Whether or not
      recently developed melatonin analogs (72) will prove more or less useful than
      melatonin in adapting to phase shift remains to be seen. If incorrectly timed,
      melatonin has the potential to induce deleterious effects. While short-term
      studies indicate that it has very low toxicity, there are no long-term safety
      data. All of the studies reported here concern healthy adult volunteers and the
      use of a preparation licensed for human experimental use and available on a named
      patient basis on prescription. There are no data on uncontrolled preparations
      available over the counter in some countries. Its effects in pregnancy,
      interaction with other medications, and many other considerations remain to be
      addressed. Thus, while melatonin is useful in well-controlled conditions, the
      indiscriminate use of unlicensed preparations is not advisable.

      pituitary-adrenal axes].
PG  - 265-70
AB  - Since urine contains cross-reacting substances to anti-cortisol(F) antibody, we
      extracted F from urine samples with dichloromethane. Using this specific assay
      system for F with TDX dynapack(fluorescence polarization immunoassay system),
      clinical significance of urinary F was tested by measuring urine samples from
      normal subjects, patients with pituitary-adrenal diseases and liver cirrhosis,
      and pregnant. The circadian rhythm of urinary F was evaluated by using samples
      collected every 4-hour period. The amount of urinary excretions of F during 4
      hours were the highest during between 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. and then gradually
      decreased reaching at the lowest level at between 0 a.m. and 4 a.m. in normal
      volunteers. Such circadian rhythm was not found in 6 patients with Cushing's
      syndrome. The urinary F levels in pregnant women started to increase in the
      samples from between 21 to 30 weeks of gestation, and the level was maintained
      even at the 5th day of post-partum. The urinary F levels in patients with liver
      cirrhosis were significantly lower than those for age-matched healthy volunteers.
      In patients with abnormal steroidogenesis, the urinary F levels in patients with 
      Cushing's syndrome were extremely high, 165-3358 micrograms/day. On the other
      hands, those in patients with deficient steroid synthetase were 2.8-26.5
      micrograms/day, and those in patients with neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma
      were 7.8-43.8 micrograms/day. The urinary F levels were about 50-fold higher in
      the patients with Cushing's syndrome than those in the normal reference interval,
      whereas serum F and urinary 17-OHCS levels were only 2.5-fold and 7-fold higher
      than those healthy volunteers, respectively. These results indicate that the
      assay of urinary F extracted with dichloromethane is the most useful test for the
      diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome.

PG  - 103-13
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of stimulus intensity on
      heart rate response in 18 low-risk human fetuses between 37 and 40 weeks
      gestation. Each fetus was stimulated in quiet sleep with a 30-s voice sound at
      intensities of 80 dB and 90 dB. The fetal cardiac electrical signal was captured 
      transabdominally at a rate of 1024 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted using
      adaptive signal-processing techniques. We found that fetuses generally exhibited 
      a 5- to 10-s decrease in heart rate following stimulus onset at an intensity of
      80 dB. The response pattern changed from deceleratory to acceleratory when
      stimulus intensity was increased to 90 dB. Our findings suggest that a heart rate
      deceleration at low-stimulus intensity may be a component of the orienting reflex
      in the human fetus.

      behavioral state organization for 30 low-risk human participants examined as
      fetuses at 38-40 weeks gestation and again as neonates at approximately 2 weeks
      postnatal age. Behavioral states were assigned similarly for fetuses and neonates
      in terms of heart rate pattern and the presence or absence of eye and gross body 
      movements. We found that the time spent in a sleep period was distributed among
      quiet sleep (QS), active sleep (AS), and indeterminate states in virtually
      identical proportions for fetuses and neonates. However, the only within-subject 
      consistency between the fetal and neonatal periods was in the duration of
      complete QS epochs. Fetuses made fewer transitions between QS and AS, but
      neonates had shorter and more structured AS-->QS transitions. These findings
      suggest that, whereas central nervous system processes governing QS do not change
      appreciably, the control of AS undergoes significant changes in the 4 weeks
      spanning the fetal and neonatal periods. We believe that the duration of enclosed
      QS epochs provides the only stable measure of behavioral state development
      between the prenatal and postnatal periods.

TI  - Effects of acute prenatal ethanol administration in a reciprocal cross of
      C57BL/6J and short-sleep mice: maternal effects and nonmaternal factors.
PG  - 28-34
AB  - An animal model was used to see if maternal genetic factors contribute to
      ethanol-induced fetal malformations. Susceptible C57BL/6J (B6) and resistant
      Short-Sleep (SS) mice were used in a reciprocal cross-breeding design. This
      design produced four fetal genotypes: true-bred B6B6 and SSSS liters and hybrid
      B6SS and SSB6 litters. Dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg of ethanol or an 
      isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin on day 9 of pregnancy. Fetuses were removed 
      on day 18 of pregnancy and assessed for soft tissue and gross malformations.
      Results show different prenatal treatment effects on malformations depending on
      the fetal genotype. Mean percentage of total malformations in ethanol-treated
      groups were 61% (B6B6), 28% (B6SS), 3% (SSB6), and 16% (SSSS), respectively.
      Litters exposed to maltose-dextrin showed low (< or = 4%) malformation rates
      regardless of fetal genotype. The difference in teratogenic response between
      genetically identical hybrid litters (B6SS and SSB6) suggests a maternal genetic 
      contribution to susceptibility. Of the two major types of malformations, forelimb
      but not kidney malformations showed a pattern characteristic of a maternal
      genetic effect. It was concluded that maternal genetic effects can be
      distinguished from fetal genetic effects responsible for ethanol teratogenesis.
      Genetically based physiological responses to alcohol in the mother may confer
      varying degrees of risk for prenatal alcohol effects in the child.

TI  - Suppression of arousal by progesterone in fetal sheep.
PG  - 767-73
AB  - The high rate of progesterone synthesis by the placenta in late gestation exposes
      the ovine fetus to high concentrations of progesterone and its metabolites that
      may affect activity of the fetal brain. The aim of this study was to determine
      the effect of inhibiting maternal progesterone synthesis on sleep-wake activity
      in fetal sheep. Fetal and maternal vascular catheters, a fetal tracheal catheter,
      and electrodes for recording fetal electrocortical (ECoG), electro-ocular (EOG)
      and nuchal muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity were implanted. At 128-131
      days gestation, progesterone production was inhibited by an injection of
      trilostane (50 mg), a 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor. Vehicle
      solution or progesterone (3 mg h(-1)) was then infused into the ewe between 6 and
      12 h after the trilostane treatment. Maternal progesterone concentrations were
      significantly reduced from 1-24 h after trilostane treatment (P < 0.05) when
      followed by vehicle infusion. Fetal breathing movements (FBM), EOG, nuchal muscle
      EMG, and behavioural arousal increased 12 h after trilostane treatment (P <
      0.05). In contrast, there was no change in fetal arousal, EOG, EMG or FBM
      activities when progesterone was infused after the trilostane treatment. These
      findings show that progesterone can influence fetal behaviour, and indicates that
      normal progesterone production tonically suppresses arousal, or wakefulness in
      the fetus.

TI  - Searching for preventable causes of infant mortality in Texas.
PG  - 81-8
AB  - Texas' health objectives include reducing the infant mortality rate from 8.1 per 
      1000 live births in 1990 to no more than 7 per 1000 by the year 2000. To help
      target potentially preventable causes of infant mortality, we examined the
      underlying cause of each of the 2545 infant deaths that occurred in Texas during 
      1990. Potential existed for primary prevention of the underlying cause of at
      least some of 778 infant deaths and for secondary prevention by treating the
      underlying causes of 1127. The following appear to be the most promising targets 
      and strategies for prevention: causes of neonatal mortality by improving the
      clinical care of high-risk newborns; sudden infant death syndrome by having
      infants sleep in the supine position; respiratory complications of preterm birth 
      by preventive and therapeutic surfactant; death from bacterial infections by
      optimal antibiotic therapy; injuries and accidents by optimal parental
      supervision; preterm birth and adverse pregnancy outcomes by optimal prenatal,
      obstetric, and neonatal care; and neural tube defects by adequate paraconceptual 
      folic acid.

TI  - High sensitivity test for the early diagnosis of gestational hypertension and
      preeclampsia. II. Circadian blood pressure variability in health and hypertensive
      pregnant women.
PG  - 153-67
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the circadian pattern of non-invasive
      ambulatorily monitored blood pressure during the trimesters of pregnancy in
      clinically healthy women as well as in pregnant women who developed gestational
      hypertension or preeclampsia, and to compare sensitivity and specificity of
      diagnosis based on the average of the blood pressure series with the values
      obtained on the basis of casual measurements. We analyzed a total of 745 blood
      pressure series sampled by ambulatory monitoring for about 48 hours in each of
      several occasions in 189 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 71 with
      gestational hypertension, and 29 with preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of BP
      variation for each group (complicated vs. uncomplicated pregnancies) and
      trimester of gestation was established by linear least-squares methods. Highly
      statistically different circadian patterns are demonstrated for systolic, mean
      arterial and diastolic blood pressure for both groups of pregnant women in all
      trimesters (P < 0.001 in all cases). Blood pressure decreases from the first
      trimester to the second and raises again in the third for healthy pregnant women,
      but continuously increases during gestation in women who developed gestational
      hypertension or preeclampsia. The differences in circadian rhythm-adjusted mean
      between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly statistically
      significant in all trimesters (P < .001). Sensitivity and specificity of
      diagnosing gestational hypertension based on the circadian mean are 73% and 48%, 
      respectively, too low for a proper individualized diagnosis of gestational
      hypertension or preeclampsia. This study confirms the predictable circadian
      variability in blood pressure during gestation. The differences between healthy
      and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as in the first trimester of
      pregnancy, but the use of the 24-hour mean BP does not provide a good approach
      for early diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.

      dilator.
PG  - 897-902
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of an over-the-counter mechanical nasal dilator
      during sleep in pregnant women with nasal congestion. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant
      women with symptoms of nocturnal nasal congestion not attributed to allergies or 
      "cold" symptoms were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either a
      spring-loaded device or placebo device without a spring. Each patient assessed
      breathing and sleep quality for a three-day baseline and three-day treatment
      period. A 10-question diary was utilized to assess breathing, ease of falling
      asleep, sleep quality, and continuity and depth of sleep. Averaged scores for
      each question were computed for baseline and treatment periods, and differences
      were calculated. Statistical analyses were by the sign test, Fisher's exact test 
      and Student's test. RESULTS: Thirty-four (21%) of 160 screened patients were
      enrolled into the study; 24 (15%) completed the study. All agreed to being
      assigned to receive either the spring-loaded device (n = 12) or a placebo (n =
      12) device. Responses to 8 of the 10 questions favored the former as compared
      with the placebo (P = .05, sign test). Moreover, patients treated with the
      spring-loaded device gave more favorable responses to the question, "Overall,
      compared with most nights, how easy was your breathing through-out last night?"
      (P = .02, t test). CONCLUSION: Use of this drug-free external nasal dilator
      improved the ease of breathing among patients with pregnancy-related nocturnal
      congestion.

TI  - Developmental aspects of sleep and breathing.
PG  - 492-9
AB  - The developmental aspects of sleep and breathing are rarely treated as one
      subject. This report attempts to link the fields of sleep research and
      developmental pulmonology in a comprehensive description of development and
      control of sleep and breathing from gestation to adulthood. Unfortunately, much
      of the investigation in this area is basic physiology and was done some time ago.
      Although this subject matter need not be updated, some of these references are
      older; however, this may be new information for the pulmonologist. The second
      part of this report details the pathophysiologic mechanisms behind the
      development of sleep-disordered breathing in children and adults. In fact,
      developmental abnormalities that occur in childhood may recrudesce in adulthood. 
      We conclude with a discussion of the familial and genetic aspects of
      sleep-disordered breathing and consider the place of sudden infant death syndrome
      in the spectrum of these disorders.

TI  - The effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on sleep respiratory and arousal 
      patterns in neonates.
PG  - 435-8
AB  - Ten term infants who were exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy and 10
      age- and sex-matched control infants participated in the study. At the age of 48 
      hours (+/- 10), all infants underwent a 150- to 200-minute polygraphic study in a
      soundproof laboratory. Respiratory and heart rates, distribution of sleep states,
      and oxygen saturation were comparable in the two groups. The number and length of
      apneic events were similarly distributed in the two groups. The proportion of
      obstructive apneic events followed by arousal was significantly higher in the
      control group especially during quiet sleep (p = 0.001). It appears that exposure
      to smoking during pregnancy is associated with a higher arousal threshold in term
      infants. This finding could be of relevance in the assessment of maternal smoking
      as a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome.

      compulsive or obsessive behavior, together with extreme resistance to change.
      According to the Crick-Mitchison theory of the biological function of rapid eye
      movement sleep, normal brain development in the fetus and infant depends on
      undisrupted function of a 'reverse learning' mechanism during rapid eye movement 
      sleep. Could abnormalities in this hypothetical reverse learning during rapid eye
      movement sleep in the fetus explain some aspects of the autistic syndromes? Does 
      the Crick-Mitchison theory suggest if a drug could interfere with rapid eye
      movement sleep and cross the placental barrier, then that drug might cause
      developmental brain disorders in the fetus? Should all pregnant women completely 
      avoid caffeine or any agent that might disrupt serotonergic or cholinergic
      systems?

AB  - To investigate the effects of lung distension and oxygenation on umbilical blood 
      flow (UBF) and plasma prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in relation to arousal and
      stimulation of breathing movements, we studied eight chronically instrumented,
      unanesthetized fetal sheep between 137 and 143 d of gestation.
      Electrocorticogram, electro-oculogram, nuchal and diaphragmatic electromyograms, 
      arterial pH and blood gas tensions, Hb oxygen saturation, body temperature, and
      UBF were recorded in each fetus. Electrocorticogram, electro-oculogram, and
      nuchal electromyograms were used to define sleep states. No sooner than 4 d after
      surgery, fetal lungs were distended with 100% O2 or N2 in a randomized order via 
      an in situ Y-endotracheal tube. PGE2 concentrations were analyzed by RIA. A
      significant increase in fetal arousal and stimulation of breathing during
      nonrapid eye movement sleep was observed during lung distension with O2 as
      compared with control periods and lung distension with nitrogen. In all sleep
      states, UBF significantly decreased during oxygenation as compared with the
      control values. However, no significant correlation was observed between the time
      of the onset of arousal and the decrease in UBF. Lung distension with N2 resulted
      in increased plasma PGE2 concentrations, whereas, no change was observed during
      oxygenation. Our data suggest that an increase in fetal partial pressure of
      arterial O2 leads to a decrease in UBF. However, the onset of arousal and
      stimulation of breathing during lung distension and oxygenation were not
      dependent on a decrease in plasma PGE2 concentrations.

TI  - Effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy and a family history of asthma on
      respiratory function in newborn infants.
PG  - 1060-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infants of mothers who smoke have reduced respiratory function and 
      are more likely to develop wheezing. Little evidence is available on the effect
      of in-utero cigarette-smoke exposure as opposed to postnatal exposure to
      environmental tobacco smoke. We used a previously validated non-invasive method
      to measure the time to peak tidal expiratory flow (tPTEF) as a proportion of
      expiratory time (tE) in newborn infants soon after birth to examine the effects
      of a family history of asthma and in-utero cigarette-smoke exposure on the
      infants' respiratory function. METHODS: We collected respiratory-function data
      from 500 healthy infants of mothers taking part in the Western Australia
      Pregnancy Cohort Study. During behaviourally defined quiet sleep, measurements
      were obtained a median of 58 h (range 26-159) after the infants were born. We
      used uncalibrated inductance plethysmography. The uncalibrated volume signal was 
      differentiated to flow and used to calculate respiratory rate, total inspiratory 
      time, tE, and tPTEF. Mothers answered questionnaires on demographic, medical, and
      pregnancy characteristics, including smoking history. Serum cotinine measurements
      were available to validate self-reported smoking history in a subset of mothers
      (238). RESULTS: Data suitable for analysis were obtained from 461 infants. In
      multivariate regression analysis, lower values of tPTEF/tE were independently
      associated with respiratory rate (beta coefficient per 10 breaths/min 0.018 [SE
      0.005], p < 0.01), age (beta coefficient per 10 h -0.008 [0.003], p < 0.01),
      maternal smoking during pregnancy (> 10 cigarettes daily; beta coefficient -0.049
      [0.022], p < 0.05), maternal hypertension during pregnancy (-0.037 [0.015], p <
      0.02), and a family history of asthma (-0.028[0.014], p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      In-utero smoke exposure, a family history of asthma, and maternal hypertension
      during pregnancy are associated with reduced respiratory function after birth. We
      speculate that these factors adversely affect lung development in utero.

OAB - Natural family planning (NFP) is a low-cost, user-controlled contraceptive method
      void of side effects. Couples who choose to rely on NFP must recognize normal
      physiological changes (e.g., a rise in the woman's temperature and changes in the
      consistency of the cervical mucus) indicating ovulation so as to avoid sexual
      intercourse during the fertile period. Couples must be motivated to use NFP if
      they wish to prevent pregnancy. Physical or emotional factors can alter the signs
      used to predict fertility, however. They and other factors can reduce NFP's
      effectiveness. The pregnancy rate is 3% for perfect use of NFP and 20% for
      typical use. Training in identifying fertility signs and counseling concerning
      the need for sexual abstinence during the fertile period improve NFP's
      contraceptive effectiveness. Many physicians do not recommend NFP. About 14% of
      women worldwide use some form of periodic abstinence. Concerns about NFP include 
      its efficacy under typical-use conditions, particularly when compared with other 
      contraceptive methods; the need for participation and cooperation of both
      partners; difficulty in using NFP if women have factors that affect fertility
      symptoms (irregular menses, infections, lack of sleep, alcohol use, emotional
      stress, and use of some drugs); and no protection against sexually transmitted
      diseases. There has been the question of whether NFP increases the risk of
      spontaneous abortion, since some studies have found an association between
      spontaneous abortion and sperm or eggs that have been in the reproductive tract
      for a prolonged period and are at the end of their life span. Recent studies do
      not indicate an association between NFP and spontaneous abortion, however.
      Effective NFP training takes about 3 months. Non-medical personnel can
      effectively teach NFP. In a European study, many women using NFP use a barrier
      method during the fertile period. New technologies and ways of identifying
      fertility signs are being developed. Ovulation detection kits tend to revolve
      around measuring the body temperature or the levels of luteinizing hormone or
      other hormones in urine.

PG  - 329-35
AB  - This study was designed to explore risk factors for breast cancer with emphasis
      on the detection of clinical markers of the hormonal imbalance during the
      perimenarche. Three hundred and thirty women diagnosed with breast cancer and 346
      population controls were identified and interviewed in Girona, Spain between 1986
      and 89. Cases were more likely than controls to have had long menstrual periods
      in the first 5 years after menarche [odds ratio (OR) = 3.0], to experience
      menopause at a late age (OR = 1.5) and to report acne during adolescence (OR =
      1.6). Family history of breast cancer was associated with an increased risk (OR =
      2.3). Cases reported a lower use of drug treatments for anxiety and sleep
      disorders than controls. Moderate alcohol drinkers and smokers were at lower risk
      for breast cancer. No statistically significant association with breast cancer
      was observed for number of children, age at last pregnancy, oral contraceptive
      use, hormonal treatment after menopause and weight perception during the teenage 
      years. Hormonal changes in the years following menarche may be relevant to breast
      cancer risk. The roles of menstrual period length and acne during adolescence
      should be further explored.

TI  - Pregnancy-associated sleep changes in the rat.
PG  - R1063-9
AB  - Sleep disorder during the course of pregnancy has been recently recognized in
      humans. However, the underlying mechanism of pregnancy-associated sleep disorder 
      remains undetermined, and sleep changes even during normal pregnancy have not
      been fully understood. To describe the effects of pregnancy on sleep, sleep-wake 
      patterns before and after fertile mating were compared in an animal model.
      Baseline recordings of sleep and brain temperature were made throughout a normal 
      4-day estrous cycle in female rats. After the rats became pregnant, the
      recordings continued across the entire pregnant period. Compared with baseline
      sleep before mating, both non-rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement
      sleep increased significantly from the first night of pregnancy. Although rapid
      eye movement sleep returned to the baseline level from midpregnancy, nocturnal
      non-rapid eye movement sleep stayed enhanced during the entire pregnant period.
      Daytime sleep fluctuated toward the end of pregnancy. Brain temperature was
      elevated during the early period of pregnancy but did not correlate with enhanced
      sleep. The results suggest that physiological changes in different stages of
      pregnancy may contribute to the regulation of maternal sleep and temperature.

TI  - Differences between primigravidae and multigravidae mothers in sleep
      disturbances, fatigue, and functional status.
PG  - 364-7
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the differences between primigravidae
      and multigravidae women in their experience of sleep efficiency, fatigue and
      vitality, and level of functioning in the third trimester of pregnancy and the
      first month postpartum. A secondary analysis of a descriptive, longitudinal study
      was done. A convenience sample of 31 pregnant women was used to test the
      hypothesis that multigravidae would have significantly higher levels of
      functioning in the household, increased fatigue, and decreased sleep efficiency
      and vitality than primigravidae at both phases of the study. Results indicate,
      however, that primigravidae experienced significantly more disturbed sleep, with 
      sleep efficiency falling from 89.79% in the third trimester to 77.25% postpartum.
      Multigravidae had only a minor reduction in sleep efficiency from 86.76% in the
      third trimester to 83.99% postpartum. Although there was no statistically
      significant difference in level of vitality, primigravidae experienced more
      fatigue (73.58 +/- 15.22) than multigravidae (64.35 +/- 18.96) at 1 month
      postpartum. These results suggest that maternal role "acquisition," experienced
      by primigravidae, results in more fatigue and sleep disruption than does maternal
      role "expansion." The significant decrease in sleep efficiency and increase in
      fatigue in primigravidae after delivery indicate that health care professionals
      need to provide anticipatory guidance to primigravidae to help smooth the
      transition from pregnancy to motherhood.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in normotensive pregnant women.
PG  - S51-4
AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) provides a profile of blood pressure 
      (BP) during daily activities and sleep and could uncover the inter-individual
      variability of BP. The aims of this study were to establish the normal values of 
      the ABPM during the three trimesters of normal pregnancy, and to compare these
      values with those obtained in the office. ABPM was carried out on 22 normotensive
      pregnant women. BP values were compared with those obtained in the office. BP
      during the third trimester was significantly higher than the BP recorded during
      the first two gestational periods. In the three trimesters of pregnancy mean
      ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP were lower than the BP measured in the
      office in lying and standing positions. On the other hand, mean ambulatory BP
      (systolic and diastolic) measured during daily activities was not significantly
      different from the BP measured in the office. Sleeping BP was significantly lower
      than waking values in all trimesters, while there were not significant
      differences in the degree of BP fall among the three trimesters. Six women were
      sequentially studied during the three trimesters of pregnancy and particularly at
      the 12, 24 and 32 weeks of pregnancy. In these women, a small but significant
      rise in mean 24 h systolic and diastolic BP was observed at 32 weeks of
      pregnancy. Sleeping BP was significantly lower than waking values in the three
      trimesters. No significant difference in the degree of BP fall on the three
      gestational dates was found. It is concluded that ABPM is a useful tool for the
      evaluation of BP variability during pregnancy. During normal pregnancy ambulatory
      BP levels are highest in the day and lowest at night at all gestational ages and 
      increased at the third trimester of pregnancy compared to the values observed
      during the first two gestational periods.

PG  - 4
AB  - Depression strikes twice as many women as men. The dramatic changes in
      psychoactive hormones like estrogen and progesterone that occur during menstrual 
      cycles and during pregnancy are believed to be key factors. According to the 4th 
      Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV), the diagnosis of
      depression requires that specific criteria be met: depressed mood or loss of
      interest or pleasure of at least 2 weeks' duration plus at least 4 of the
      following additional symptoms: change in weight, altered sleep pattern,
      psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, feelings
      of worthlessness or guilt, and suicidal ideation. Several new drug therapies are 
      available for treating major depressive illness.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy.
PG  - 503-6
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea is a common medical condition characterized by periodic
      apneas during sleep that produce hypoxia and sleep disruption. Several cases of
      obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy have been reported. In the case reported the
      woman admitted for evaluation and management of preeclampsia was observed
      experiencing apneic episodes and oxygen desaturation during sleep. Subsequent
      evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. Pregnancy may be
      complicated by obstructive sleep apnea with potential adverse effects on the
      mother and fetus. Prompt diagnosis would allow early treatment and may prevent
      low birth weight and the development of preeclampsia.

PG  - 191-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of sleeping arrangements as risk factors for
      the sudden infant death syndrome after a national risk reduction campaign.
      DESIGN: Two year population based case-control study. Parental interviews were
      conducted for each infant who died and for four controls matched for age and date
      of interview. SETTING: Three regions in England with a total population of 17
      million people. SUBJECTS: 195 babies who died and 780 matched controls. RESULTS: 
      Prone and side sleeping positions both carried increased risks of death compared 
      with supine when adjusted for maternal age, parity, gestation, birth weight,
      exposure to smoke, and other relevant factors in the sleeping environment
      (multivariate odds ratio = 9.00 (95% confidence interval 2.84 to 28.47) and 1.84 
      (1.02 to 3.31), respectively). The higher incidence of side rather than prone
      sleeping led to a higher population attributable risk (side 18.4%, prone 14.2%). 
      More of the infants who died were found with bed covers over their heads (21.58; 
      6.21 to 74.99). The use of a dummy had an apparent protective effect (0.38; 0.21 
      to 0.70). Bed sharing for the whole night was a significant risk factor for
      infants whose mothers smoked (9.25; 2.31 to 34.02). No protective effect of
      breast feeding could be identified on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study confirms the importance of certain risk factors for the sudden infant death
      syndrome and identifies others-for example, covers over the head, side sleeping
      position-which may be amenable to change by educating and informing parents and
      health care professionals.

PG  - 198-201
AB  - Two patients with Type I Klippel-Feil syndrome presented at the antenatal clinic.
      The first patient, who suffered from sleep apnoea, was delivered of a healthy
      infant by vacuum extraction. The second, who was profoundly deaf and had marked
      kyphoscoliosis, developed pregnancy-induced hypertension and urinary tract
      infection and was delivered at 38 weeks by vacuum extraction. In both cases
      epidural analgesia was employed to allow pain relief during labour. Anaesthetic
      management of Klippel-Feil syndrome is discussed and the benefits of early
      anaesthetic assessment and continued involvement of senior anaesthetic and
      obstetric staff emphasized.

TI  - Bromocriptine-induced blockade of pregnancy affects sleep patterns in rats.
PG  - 219-26
AB  - We previously reported a marked enhancement of nocturnal sleep in pregnant and
      pseudopregnant rats and suggested a possible involvement of prolactin (PRL) in
      the modulation of sleep during pregnancy. In the present study, the release of
      PRL was blocked by a dopamine agonist, bromocriptine (CB-154), and time-course
      changes in sleep were analyzed in pregnant rats. After pregnancy was induced by
      fertile mating with males (Day 1), rats (n = 5) were injected with 1 mg of CB-154
      subcutaneously 3 h before the onset of darkness for a 3-day period (Days 1-3 or
      6-8). Electroencephalogram and electromyogram for evaluating the state of sleep
      and wakefulness were monitored continuously up to the reappearance of an estrous 
      cycle in the treated rats. The CB-154 treatment resulted in abortion in all rats 
      and suppressed the pregnancy-associated nocturnal increase in
      non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS). The
      CB-154 treatment also decreased the diurnal amount of NREMS significantly. The
      sleep-suppressing effect of CB-154 on Days 6-8 was induced more promptly than
      that on Days 1-3. In the night of proestrus following the termination of
      pregnancy (Day 4 or Day 12), both NREMS and REMS decreased to the baseline level 
      observed at prepregnant proestrus. Thus, our results indicated that CB-154
      neutralized the pregnancy-associated sleep changes, which might be due to the
      inhibition of the PRL release. It is suggested that PRL is at least partially
      responsible for the regulation of sleep during pregnancy.

TI  - General pharmacology of recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor.
PG  - 727-39
AB  - General pharmacological effects of recombinant human basic fibroblast growth
      factor (bFGF) were investigated. 1. Central nervous system: Basic FGF produced
      almost no effect on the general symptoms and behaviors of mice. Basic FGF did not
      influence the spontaneous motor activity, hexobarbital-induced anesthesia,
      electroshock seizure threshold, pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure in mice and
      normal body temperature and spinal reflex in rats up to a dose of 1 mg/kg (s.c., 
      i.v.). As regards pain sensation, it inhibited the acetic acid-induced writhing
      at 1 mg/kg (s.c.). No abnormal waves were observed in spontaneous EEG of the
      rabbit up to 1 mg/kg (i.v.) of bFGF, but at 0.1 mg/kg it had a slight effect on
      the ratio of EEG levels and at 1 mg/kg induced an increase in rest period,
      disappearance in the period of fast wave sleep and a decrease in the period of
      deep sleep. 2. Somatic nervous system: Basic FGF did not influence the corneal
      reflex, twitch response of the skin and diaphragm-phrenic nerve preparations. 3. 
      Autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle: Basic FGF showed little effects on
      the spontaneous movement of the isolated ileum, contraction induced by various
      agonists in isolated ileum, resting tension and noradrenaline(NA)-induced
      contraction of the aorta, resting tension and histamine-induced contraction of
      isolated trachea, spontaneous movement and 5-HT-induced contraction of isolated
      strips of stomach fundus, NA-induced contraction of isolated vas deferens of the 
      rat up to the concentration of 10(-4) g/ml. Basic FGF augmented the tone of the
      isolated non-pregnant uterus at the concentrations of 10(-5) g/ml and above and
      inhibited or tended to inhibit the contractile tension of non-pregnant or
      pregnant uterus at 10(-4) g/ml, but it did not influence the spontaneous movement
      of the uterus, either the non-pregnant or pregnant, under in situ conditions even
      at a dose of 1 mg/kg (i.v.). Basic FGF did not influence the pupil size. 4.
      Respiratory and circulatory systems: Basic FGF had no effect on the isolated
      heart. The influence was not exerted on the heart rate for the isolated atria but
      slight inhibition of contractile force was observed at 10(-4) g/ml. In
      anesthetized dogs a decrease in blood pressure, a slight increase in heart rate
      and respiratory rate and a decrease in femoral blood flow were observed at 0.01
      and 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.) of bFGF Similarly, a slight increase in heart rate and a
      slight decrease of blood pressure were observed at 1 mg/kg (s.c.) in conscious
      rats. 5. Digestive system: Administration of bFGF at 1 mg/kg did not result in
      changes in the transport capacity within the gastrointestinal tract (s.c., i.v.) 
      and the secretion of the gastric juice (s.c.). 6. Urine output and electrolyte
      metabolism: Basic FGF produced a decrease in urinary Na+ excretion at 1 mg/kg
      (s.c.), and showed a tendency to increase in urinary volume at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg
      (i.v.). At 1 mg/kg (i.v.) urinary excretion of Na+ and Cl- was decreased
      significantly. It had no effect on the ability of rats to excrete PSP (phenol
      red) up to 1 mg/kg (s.c.). 7. Blood system: Basic FGF did not influence the
      coagulation time of the whole blood, prothrombin time and activated partial
      thromboplastin time of rats up to 1 mg/kg (s.c., i.v.). It did not influence the 
      aggregation of rabbit platelets induced by collagen and ADP up to 10(-4) g/ml.
      Basic FGF at concentration of 10(-4) g/ml exhibited no hemolytic action. 8. Local
      action: Plantar subcutaneous injection of bFGF at above 0.005 mg/site induced
      edema by itself on and after the next day, and also reinforced
      carrageenin-induced edema from 1 day after injection. The results show that bFGF 
      did not produce any acute effects on the somatic nervous system, autonomic
      nervous system, smooth muscle and blood system. In contrast, bFGF produced slight
      effects on the circulatory system, central nervous system and kidney function
      when injected systemically. Subcutaneous administration may produce edema at the 
      s

TI  - An automated image analysis method for the measurement of neutrophil alkaline
      phosphatase in the prenatal screening of Down syndrome.
PG  - 254-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: (1) To develop an image analysis method for the measurement of
      neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP); (2) To establish a correlation of
      urea-resistant fraction of NAP (URNAP)/NAP scoring between the manual and
      automated methods, and (3) to assess the value of URNAP/NAP in the prenatal
      screening of Down syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: Slides from 15 unaffected controls were
      blindly scored by both methods. The Pearson test was used for correlation
      analysis. Slides from 15 Down syndrome pregnancies and 25 unaffected controls
      were scored manually. RESULTS: A coefficient r = 0.93 was obtained comparing the 
      URNAP/NAP scores generated by the two methods. Average time for scoring by the
      automated method was 8 min. The median URNAP/NAP values for Down syndrome and
      unaffected controls were 112/86.1 and 51/51.5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Scores 
      obtained by both methods highly correlate. Automated scoring is threefold faster.
      Down syndrome cases have higher URNAP/NAP scores compared to unaffected controls,
      which suggests that URNAP/NAP is an extremely useful marker for mid-trimester
      prenatal screening.

TI  - Sleep in pregnancy.
PG  - 20-6
AB  - The article examines relationships between pregnancy and maternal sleep.
      Specifically, sleep as a restorative process is considered with regard for the
      metabolic and arousal demands of childbearing. The analysis draws attention to
      the limited number of studies in the area and the need for greater research
      interest in pregnancy sleep phenomena. The available evidence indicates that
      maternal slow-wave and rapid eye movement which are key to anabolic activity and 
      neural-cerebral recharge, are protected throughout pregnancy until perhaps the
      last 3 to 4 weeks before delivery. The sleep disturbances about which term
      gravidas complain appear to be based on increased periods of wakefulness after
      sleep onset.

TI  - Sleep dreams of women in the childbearing years: a review of research.
PG  - 12-9
AB  - Descriptions of dreams of women during pregnancy have appeared in the literature 
      for more than a century. Daydreams and sleep dreams are differentiated. A review 
      of the literature published during the last four decades uncovered a limited
      number of empirical articles. The general consensus is that the sleep dreams of
      pregnant women are indicative of their concerns regarding safety for self and for
      the expected child. The most recent information focuses on the use of groups to
      help pregnant women explore the content of their dreams.

TI  - Prevalence of modifiable risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome in British
      Forces Germany.
PG  - 72-8
AB  - A questionnaire survey was conducted amongst parents in the military community in
      British Forces Germany to investigate the prevalence of known and suspected risk 
      factors for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Over a thousand questionnaires were
      returned (response rate 58%) and these showed that the prevalence of babies being
      placed in the prone position to sleep is now extremely low and the use of room
      thermometers to help control ambient temperature is widespread. However 29% of
      the mothers had smoked in pregnancy and 44% of households with a new-born baby
      had at least one parent who smoked. Additional health promotion activity aimed at
      reducing the prevalence of smoking in pregnancy and amongst the parents of
      new-born babies is recommended.

TI  - Observations on a recent increase in plagiocephaly without synostosis.
PG  - 877-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To verify and determine the cause of an increase in the referral of
      infants with plagiocephaly without synostosis (PWS) to a single tertiary
      craniofacial center. DESIGN: A chart review was performed for 269 infants with a 
      diagnosis of PWS who presented to a single tertiary craniofacial center between
      1979 and 1994. The pattern of referral for PWS was analyzed using both simple
      linear regression and time series regression analyses. In addition, the referral 
      pattern for PWS was compared with that for infants seen at the same center who
      received a diagnosis of synostotic plagiocephaly. Changes in the distribution of 
      several demographic, perinatal, and clinical variables during the study period
      were also assessed. Finally, in an effort to identify correlates of the risk of
      PWS developing, characteristics of patients who were Missouri residents and
      presented between 1992 and 1994 were evaluated and compared with those of the
      1993 Missouri live birth cohort. SETTING: The Cleft Palate and Craniofacial
      Deformities Institute, St Louis Children's Hospital, Washington University
      Medical Center. RESULTS: The average annual number of referrals to our center for
      PWS in the period 1992 to 1994 was more than sixfold greater than that for the
      preceding 13 years. There was a statistically significant increase in the annual 
      number of referrals to our center during the 16-year study period. Moreover,
      there was evidence that the average annual increase in referrals was
      significantly greater during the last 3 years (1992 through 1994) of the study
      than in the first 13 years. This shift in the referral patterns is roughly
      contemporaneous with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations regarding
      infant sleep position. There was no evidence that either the mean number of
      referrals or the average annual increase in referrals for patients with
      synostosis changed during the study period. Among patients with PWS, the average 
      age at presentation did not change during the study period. There were also no
      significant changes in the distribution of other demographic, perinatal, and
      clinical variables. When compared with the Missouri birth cohort, infants with
      PWS were significantly more likely to be boys and to have been delivered by
      forceps. There was also some evidence that patients with PWS were more likely to 
      be born prematurely and to be products of multiple-gestation pregnancies. These
      associations were, however, of only borderline statistical significance.
      CONCLUSION: Referrals to our center for PWS increased markedly in 1992 relative
      to previous years. The temporal coincidence of this increase with the American
      Academy of Pediatrics recommendation to avoid the prone sleeping position, to
      reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, suggests a possible causal
      relationship. If this association is causal, education regarding the need for
      head position rotation coupled with that for sudden infant death syndrome should 
      obviate positional PWS.

TI  - Morphological characteristics of the bovine corpus luteum during the estrous
      cycle and pregnancy.
PG  - 1295-325
AB  - The corpus luteum, one of the biological clocks of the estrous cycle and
      pregnancy, is known foremost for its production of progesterone that blocks the
      pituitary release of gonadotropins and prepares the uterus for a pregnancy. The
      cellular sources of this progesterone are the steroidogenic small and large
      luteal cells. Other luteal cells that are not steroidogenic, but are believed to 
      have an important role in the function of this gland are the fibroblast,
      macrophages and endothelial cells. The most prominent luteal cell is the large
      steroidogenic cell characterized by an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum 
      and densely packed spherical mitochondria that are indicative of its contribution
      to most of the circulating progesterone believed to be constitutively secreted
      and not under the control of LH. Other distinguishing features of the large
      luteal cell are the presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum, prominent Golgi, and
      secretory granules that are indicative of endocrine cells. This cell undergoes
      dynamic changes across the estrous cycle and pregnancy, believed to reflect a
      change in progesterone and protein secretion that will eventually influence a
      successful pregnancy or another ovulation if pregnancy fails. The morphological
      characteristics of the bovine luteal cells are the focus of this review.

TI  - Sleep in multiple pregnancy: breathing patterns, oxygenation, and periodic leg
      movements.
PG  - 1622-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to study whether multiple pregnancy at the third
      trimester predisposes to breathing disturbances and arterial oxyhemoglobin
      desaturation during sleep. STUDY DESIGN: Nocturnal breathing, oxygenation, and
      movement activity were studied in 10 mothers: 8 with twins, 1 with triplets, and 
      1 with quadruplets. RESULTS: No obstructive and few central sleep apnea episodes 
      were observed. Four subjects had episodes of increased respiratory resistance,
      but only one, the mother with quadruplets, was significantly affected. Arterial
      oxyhemoglobin saturation was always maintained above 90%. Periodic leg movements 
      were present in all mothers, with a frequency range of 3.7 to 49.7 movements per 
      hour. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the large uterus in multiple pregnancy, nocturnal 
      breathing and oxygenation are well maintained. Increased motor activity and
      frequent awakenings suggest poor sleep quality, which may be further compromised 
      by intensive periodic leg movements.

TI  - Laboratory indicators for monitoring HIV disease.
PG  - 359-62
AB  - Immunological monitoring of disease progression following HIV infection and
      seroconversion illness, latency and AIDS, not only helps in the basic
      investigation of the natural history of the viral infection in man, but also can 
      assist in prognosis and treatment of AIDS-defining illnesses. However, outside
      clinical trials, these tests should be selected and used in clinical practice
      only if they are validated as relevant and effective. The absolute CD4+ T-helper 
      lymphocyte count, measured by flow cytometry, has emerged as the best available
      investigation, but needs care in sampling due to diurnal and circadian rhythms,
      effects of age, pregnancy, therapy, intercurrent infections and technique.
      Sampling should provide a baseline and trends-monthly intervals initially, then
      quarterly in uncomplicated cases. Thresholds may be given for counts (e.g.
      200/microliter) below which prophylaxis against pneumocystis pneumonia should be 
      administered, and repeating persistently low counts (e.g. below 50/microliter) is
      seldom helpful in practice. Serum levels of beta-2 microglobulin, neopterin and
      immunoglobulins rarely add information. Physicians and laboratories should have
      testing guidelines based on clinical audit of best practice, based in turn on
      scientific understanding of the immunological processes involved.

TI  - Hormone replacement therapy: clinical benefits and side-effects.
PG  - S31-6
AB  - Beside well-established clinical benefits, the current doses of oestrogens may
      induce clinical side-effects leading to non-compliance and loss of efficacy.
      During a normal menstrual cycle the incidence of any cyclic discomfort is
      consistently reported to be lowest during the mild-follicular phase when plasma
      E2 remains between 60 and 150 pg/ml. The incidence of pregnancy-like symptoms
      such as bloating, breast tenderness and mood swings tends to increase in
      mid-luteal phase when E2 increases upto 150 pg/ml. On the other hand incidence of
      asthenia, sleep disturbances, depressive mood, headaches and migraines increase
      during perimenstrual days when E2 drops to 40 pg/ml or below. Accordingly
      experimental and human studies in castrated animals and postmenopausal women
      suggest that plasma E2 around 100 pg/ml is optimal for treatment of hot flushes, 
      prevention of bone loss and cardiovascular protection. Due to large
      interindividual variation in estrogen clearance rate, it is unlikely that any
      standardized unique dose of oral or non-oral formulations will reproduce the
      optimal levels in all postmenopausal users. Efforts for individual titration are 
      mandatory to improve compliance and actual efficacy on a long term. Because older
      postmenopausal women tend to have a better clinical tolerance to low E2 levels,
      objective markers of efficacy should also be identified when the aim of HRT is
      the prevention of osteoporosis or vascular diseases. In addition clinical and
      metabolic side-effects related to added progestins can be substantially reduced
      by the use of lower dose inducing amenorrhea and by progesterone instead of
      synthetic steroids.

      continuous i.v. Infusion of Sulproston 9 hours after administration of a 3
      mg-PGE2-vaginal tablet overnight. In group B (n = 22), i.v. Sulproston was
      started 2 hours after priming with 1 mg Gemeprost-vaginal suppositories. The
      outcome of these two regimens was compared with that of repeated administration
      of 1 mg Gemeprost-vaginal suppositories at 6-hourly intervals (group C, n = 25). 
      In each group. If uterine contractions failed to appear after one day, the
      treatment was discontinued for a sleep rest over night and then resumed. Genetic 
      disorders or fetal malformations were the most frequent reasons for termination. 
      Patients with intrauterine fetal demise, rupture of the membranes, preterm labour
      or a ripe cervix (Bishop Score > 3) were excluded. Median time intervals from
      induction to abortion were 33 hours in group A and 23 hours in each Group B and
      C. The rate of fetal expulsions within 12, 24 and 36 hours in groups B and C were
      similar. Women of parity > or = 1 showed significantly shorter intervals than
      nulliparae in groups A and C. Only one woman (in group A) failed to expel after
      induction, in four other cases (in groups A and B) complications (local
      thrombophlebitis, bronchospasm) were noted. The serial administration of 1 mg
      Gemeprost-vaginal suppositories at 5-hourly intervals showed fewer side effects
      and seems to be as efficient as sulproston i.v. after cervical ripening.

      Washington: a case-control study.
PG  - 626-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the prone sleep position was associated with an
      increased risk of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). STUDY DESIGN:
      Population-based case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: Case subjects were infants who
      died of SIDS in King County, Washington. Control subjects were randomly selected 
      infants born in King County. Up to four control subjects were matched on date of 
      birth to each case subject. METHODS: During the study period, November 1992
      through October 1994, sleep-position data were collected on infants who died of
      SIDS by the King Count Medical Examiner's Office during their investigation of
      the deaths. Parents of infants chosen as control subjects were contacted by
      telephone, and sleep position information was obtained. Infants who usually slept
      on their abdomen were classified as sleeping prone; those who usually slept on
      the side or back were categorized as sleeping nonprone. The adjusted odds ratio
      for prone sleep position as a risk factor for SIDS was calculated with
      conditional logistic regression after control for race, birth weight, maternal
      age, maternal marital status, household income, and maternal cigarette smoking
      during pregnancy. RESULTS: Sleep position data were collected on 47 infants with 
      SIDS (77% of eligible infants) and 142 matched control subjects; 57.4% of infants
      who died of SIDS usually slept prone versus 24.6% of control subjects (p <
      0.00001). The unadjusted odds ratio for prone sleep position as a risk factor for
      SIDS was 4.69 (95% confidence interval: 2.17, 10.17). After control for
      potentially confounding variables, the adjusted odds ratio for prone sleep
      position was 3.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.08, 9.03). CONCLUSION: Prone sleep 
      position was significantly associated with an increased risk of SIDS among a
      group of American infants.

TI  - The maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the third trimester of human 
      pregnancy.
PG  - 419-28
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The third trimester of pregnancy is characterized by a mildly
      hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, possibly driven by
      elevated circulating levels of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) of
      placental origin. In-vitro studies have demonstrated that glucocorticoids and
      oestrogen stimulate while progesterone inhibits the expression of CRH mRNA and/or
      protein, suggesting that several potential interactions between the placenta and 
      the HPA axis may exist. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: To investigate the detailed pattern 
      of circulating immunoreactive (ir) CRH, ACTH, cortisol, oestradiol and
      progesterone during the third trimester of pregnancy, plasma samples were drawn
      serially every 30 minutes from 22 healthy pregnant women (age 32.0 +/- 1.1 years,
      mean +/- SE) between the 34th and 36th week of gestation. Ten women had plasma
      samples drawn between 0800 h and 2000 h (daytime group), and 12 between 2000 h
      and 0800 h (night-time group). The hormone concentrations obtained were analysed 
      for pulsatility by the Detect program, for detection of circadian rhythmicity by 
      comparison between the first and second 6-hour periods within each group by
      Student's t-test, and for time-dependent correlations by cross-correlation
      analysis. RESULTS: All five hormones were secreted in a pulsatile fashion. There 
      was no apparent circadian rhythm of CRH or oestradiol secretion, whereas there
      was a clear circadian rhythm in plasma ACTH, cortisol and progesterone secretion,
      with the latter in reverse phase (P < 0.05). No significant correlations were
      observed between CRH and ACTH, whereas, as expected, ACTH and cortisol
      concentrations were strongly correlated with each other over time (r = 0.32 and
      0.70 at lag time 30 minutes for the daytime and night-time groups, respectively),
      with ACTH leading cortisol. A weak positive correlation was observed between CRH 
      and cortisol concentrations for the night-time group at lag time 0 minute,
      suggesting that the latter may have a positive effect on the former in vivo.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that placental CRH, although pulsatile, drives
      quantitatively the maternal HPA axis in the third trimester of pregnancy in a
      non-circadian, non-pulsatile fashion. The maternal HPA axis is probably driven in
      a circadian and pulsatile fashion by another major ACTH secretagogue, most likely
      AVP of parvocellular paraventricular nucleus origin.

TI  - Self-reported snoring in pregnancy. Association with fetal outcome.
PG  - 885-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of self-reported snoring in pregnant
      compared with nonpregnant women. To compare indicators of fetal outcome in
      pregnant women with self-reported frequent snoring vs those without snoring.
      STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized screening and comparison between groups.
      PATIENTS: Three hundred fifty pregnant women and 110 age-matched nonpregnant
      women. METHODS: Survey evaluating self-reported snoring. For the pregnant women, 
      infant birthweight, APGAR scores, and other indicators of fetal outcome were
      obtained by record review. RESULTS: Frequent snoring was reported in 14% of the
      pregnant women vs 4% of the nonpregnant women (Chi2=6.2; df=1; p<0.05). The
      pregnant women who reported frequent snoring did not have deliveries resulting in
      infants with evidence of an increase in compromised outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:
      Frequent snoring is reported more often in pregnant than in nonpregnant women.
      Snoring mothers do not appear to be at increased risk for delivering infants with
      fetal compromise as might be expected with the concomitant occurrence of
      obstructive sleep apnea.

TI  - A comparison of prospective and retrospective assessments of sleep.
PG  - 455-60
AB  - The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlations between
      retrospective and prospective assessments of sleep. Subjective reports of sleep
      characteristics and sleep quality were obtained from 146 young (20-40 years,
      average age 29.15) healthy men (n = 43), nonpregnant (n = 70) and pregnant women 
      (n = 33). Three types of subjective sleep reports were obtained: (1) general
      estimates of sleep habits (retrospective measures); (2) sleep logs completed upon
      awakening on three successive workdays (prospective measures); and (3) general
      sleep complaints. Men showed the greatest stability in the sleep log reports,
      followed by nonpregnant women, with pregnant women showing the least stability.
      Significant positive correlations between prospective (log reported) and
      retrospective (general estimates) sleep measures were found only for men.
      However, for measures of sleep quality, such as feelings of fatigue upon
      awakening, women showed greater agreement between their general estimates and
      three nightly reports. The limitations of using retrospective estimates in sleep 
      surveys are discussed.

TI  - Chronotoxicity of sodium valproate in pregnant mouse and embryo.
PG  - 253-8
AB  - The influence of dosing time on the embryotoxicity of sodium valproate (valproic 
      acid, VPA) was investigated in ICR mice under a light-dark (12:12) cycle. A
      significant circadian rhythm was shown for VPA-induced embryotoxicity, with the
      highest value at 1700 and the lowest at 0100. A similar pattern of rhythm was
      also shown for VPA-induced toxicity in pregnant and nonpregnant mice. No
      significant dosing time-dependent difference between injection at 1700 and 0100
      was demonstrated for VPA concentrations in the embryo, plasma and brain. The
      rhythm in the embryotoxicity seems to be related to the rhythm in the sensitivity
      of the embryo and dam to the drug. Embryotoxicity and VPA concentrations were
      significantly higher on gestational day 13 than day 7. The pharmacokinetics of
      VPA contribute, at least partly, to the gestational stage-dependent
      embryotoxicity of VPA. The timing of drug administration (i.e., gestational stage
      and circadian phase) appears to be essential for studies on the embryotoxicity of
      VPA in mice.

TI  - Entrainment of Syrian hamster circadian activity rhythms by neonatal melatonin
      injections.
PG  - R533-40
AB  - The circadian rhythms of fetal and neonatal rodents are entrained by their
      mother. This entrainment is dependent upon the maternal suprachiasmatic nucleus
      (SCN), but the mechanism of entrainment is unknown. Administration of the pineal 
      hormone melatonin to pregnant, SCN-lesioned female Syrian hamsters entrains the
      activity rhythms of their hamster pups. The aim of this study was to determine
      whether melatonin injected directly in neonatal Syrian hamsters is able to
      entrain circadian rhythms and, if so, for how long this effect persists during
      development. Injection of melatonin in two groups of hamster pups at opposite
      phases on postnatal days 1-5 entrained the onset of activity rhythms on the day
      of weaning to two phases 10.67 h apart. Melatonin injection did not entrain
      activity rhythms to opposite phases on either postnatal days 6-10 or 21-25.
      Vehicle injection did not entrain animals to opposite phases at any of the ages
      studied. These results demonstrate that melatonin is able to act directly on the 
      neonate to cause entrainment and that this effect disappears after postnatal day 
      6.

PG  - 113-26
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the sleep-wake patterns of
      fullterm (> or = 37 weeks) newborns and to evaluate the effects of specific
      factors including maternal gestational diabetes, infant size and anthropometric
      measures, gender, gestational age and delivery variables. METHODS: Two-hundred
      twenty newborns were studied in the hospital nursery for a continuous 24-h period
      with miniature activity monitors attached to the infants' ankles. The sample
      consisted of 102 infants of gestational diabetic mothers (IGDM) and 118 controls.
      Anthropometric measurements were obtained and maternal and infant characteristics
      were recorded. RESULTS: The newborns had a discernible diurnal sleep pattern and 
      slept twice as much during the nighttime as daytime hours (P < 0.001). Higher
      skinfold measurements correlated significantly with increased quiet and
      motionless sleep (P < 0.05) for the IGDM but not for controls. Sleep of infants
      born at later gestational ages was characterized by increased percent of quiet
      and motionless sleep (P < 0.0001). No direct gender effects were identified.
      CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors were associated with the sleep-wake patterns of the
      newborns on our study cohort including maternal glucose values during pregnancy, 
      increased measures of adiposity in IGDM, increased gestational age, mode of
      delivery and delivery Sequence. Investigation of the sleep-wake characteristics
      of neonates using activity monitors is a noninvasive method for gaining new
      understanding of the relationships between sleep wake activity patterns and
      infant characteristics.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome. A review.
PG  - 243-8
AB  - Restless legs syndrome is characterized by unpleasant, deep-seated paresthesias
      in the legs and sometimes the arms. These sensations occur at rest and are
      relieved by movement. Sleep disturbance is common. Many patients also have
      periodic movements of sleep. Mild symptoms of restless legs occur in up to 5% of 
      the population. Restless legs syndrome is idiopathic in most patients, but it may
      be the presenting feature of iron deficiency and is also common in uremia,
      pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and polyneuropathy. Treatment
      of the underlying cause, when possible, usually relieves the symptoms. For
      patients with severe symptoms, levodopa, bromocriptine mesylate, opioids,
      carbamazepine, clonazepam, and clonidine hydrochloride have proved to be
      effective.

TI  - Women's perceptions of fatigue during pregnancy and postpartum: the impact of
      length of hospital stay.
PG  - 67-80
AB  - Women's experiences during late pregnancy and the early postpartum period were
      examined relative to time of discharge from the hospital. Women who were
      discharged in 3 days or sooner were compared to women who were discharged after 3
      days or sooner were compared to women who were discharged after 3 days, with
      respect to fatigue. A rest and activity questionnaire was completed by the women 
      in the third trimester of pregnancy, in postpartum Week 1, and in postpartum Week
      4. Few differences were found with respect to hours slept, number of sleep
      interruptions, perceptions of tiredness, and impact of tiredness on daily life;
      tiredness was a major aspect of women's experience, regardless of how long they
      stayed in hospital. The information will help nurses preparing women for their
      late pregnancy and postpartum experiences and will ease the concern of those who 
      believe women will be more tired if they leave hospital soon after birth.

TI  - Human energy expenditure in affluent societies: an analysis of 574
      doubly-labelled water measurements.
PG  - 72-92
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe average levels of free-living energy expenditure in
      people from affluent societies and to determine the influence of body weight,
      height, age and sex. DESIGN: Analysis of 574 measurements of total energy
      expenditure (TEE, assessed by the doubly-labelled water method); basal metabolic 
      rate (BMR, directly measured or derived from similar directly measured proxy
      measures such as during sleep); activity energy expenditure (AEE, derived as
      TEE-BMR); and physical activity level (PAL, derived as TEE/BMR) from people aged 
      2-95 years. The dataset was extracted from 1614 published and unpublished
      measurements in 1156 subjects after exclusion of repeat estimates and subjects in
      special physiological or behavioural states (eg pregnancy, athletic or military
      training etc). RESULTS: A separate analysis of data from non-ambulant subjects,
      and from elite endurance athletes (all excluded from the main dataset)
      established the limits of human daily energy expenditure at around 1.2 x BMR and 
      4.5 x BMR. In the main analysis, the validity of PAL as an index of TEE adjusted 
      for BMR was tested and confirmed. Regression equations were then derived to
      describe TEE, BMR, AEE and PAL in terms of body weight, height, age and sex. As
      anticipated, TEE, BMR and AEE were all positively related to weight and height,
      while age was a negative predictor, especially of activity. The influence of
      weight disappeared when TEE was expressed as PAL, but height and age remained as 
      highly significant predictors. For all three components, females expended 11%
      less energy on average than males after adjustment for weight, height and age.
      Average levels of energy expenditure in different age and sex groups are
      tabulated. CONCLUSIONS: There now exists a large and robust database of energy
      expenditure measurements obtained by the doubly-labelled water method. Analysis
      of the data from affluent societies shows that, in general, levels of energy
      expenditure are similar to the recommendations for energy requirements adopted by
      FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) and UK Department of Health (1991). PAL values for active
      subjects tend to be higher than is currently assumed. The current analysis
      provides a substantial body of normal data against which other estimates can be
      compared.

TI  - Characteristic changes in sleep patterns during pregnancy in rats.
PG  - 5-8
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in sleep patterns during
      pregnancy to better understand sleep regulation during pregnancy. We
      uninterruptedly recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), and
      brain temperature (Tbr) throughout pregnancy in rats. The duration of non-rapid
      eye movement (non-REM) sleep decreased after day 5 of pregnancy associated with
      an inverse increase in the number of non-REM sleep episodes. Thus, the amount of 
      total non-REM sleep time remained constant throughout pregnancy. The amount of
      total REM sleep time decreased on day 17 of pregnancy after which the reduced
      state was sustained. That was mainly due to a decrease in the number of REM sleep
      episodes. Brain temperature (Tbr) gradually decreased as pregnancy advanced,
      reaching its lowest value 3 days before delivery. These observations provide a
      better understanding of the sleep patterns during pregnancy, and useful
      information for investigation of mechanisms of sleep regulation during pregnancy.

TI  - [Relationships between wakefulness of mothers and their infants' movements during
      night sleep of postpartum 6 weeks].
PG  - 42-51
AB  - Relationships between wakefulness of mothers and their infants' movements during 
      night sleep in postpartum period were studied under conditions in daily life.
      Subjects were ten primiparae, aged 23-31 yrs (mean age, 26.8 yrs), who had a
      normal course of pregnancy and delivery. Eight of their infants were breast-fed, 
      and two were formula-fed. Mother's polysomnograms, (EEG, EOG, EMG, and ECG) and
      actigrams of infants' legs were simultaneously recorded using Medilog 9000 at
      home in the 1st, 3rd and 6th postpartum weeks. Mothers' sleep stages and their
      infants' movements were visually scored by an epoch of one minute. The infants'
      movements were classified into four states, MOV0, MOV1, MOV2, and MOV3. We
      defined MOV0 as no activities during one epoch, MOV1 as less than 20 seconds
      activities, MOV2 as from 20 to 40 seconds activities and MOV3 as from 40 to 60
      seconds activities. The average times of wakefulness on the mothers were 102.6
      min (SD = 23.5), 84.8 min (SD = 52.8) and 79.4 min (SD = 40.5) for 1st, 3rd and
      6th postpartum weeks, respectively. There were no significant differences among
      them. The mothers' wakefulness coincided with the infants' movements MOV3 was
      86.9% for total epochs of MOV3, while deep sleep of the mothers was observed
      during epochs of MOV0 and MOV1. This trend did not change across the postpartum
      weeks. The time-lag between the mothers' wakefulness and their infants' movements
      was calculated. In 85.4% of 48 times of mother's awakenings for feeding their
      infants, their infants began to move before their mothers woke up. In 63.4% of
      the cases, the mothers woke up within two minutes after their infants began to
      move. In the present study, eight of the ten mothers satisfactorily adapted
      themselves to the life style in the postpartum period, while two had difficulties
      in adaptation. In conclusion, ten mothers' wakefulness during night sleep in
      postpartum period was related to their infants' movements, and its relationship
      did not change through the 1st, 3rd and 6th weeks of delivery.

TI  - Remote continuous physiological monitoring in the home.
PG  - 107-13
AB  - As part of a larger study we established a remote physiological monitoring
      network to investigate cardiorespiratory function during sleep in 400 infants in 
      their homes. The objective of the study was to link measurements made at three
      weeks and three months of age with detailed measurements of maternal and fetal
      nutrition during pregnancy and subsequent outcome (growth, development and
      cardiorespiratory diseases). Five infants per night were monitored anywhere
      within a radius of 10 miles (16 km) of the remote hub. Of 800 overnight studies
      on 64 (of 400) infants, 99 were completed. Options allowed downloading data from 
      monitor memory as well as review (on- and off-line) from the infants' or nurses' 
      homes, the hub and the Oxford telemonitoring centre. The reasons for these
      measurements being made at home were to ensure physiological accuracy and to
      reduce cost. The network was effectively run by local community nurses; with the 
      exception of the size and cost of the monitors, it had all the elements of a
      remote primary-care clinical service.

TI  - Perinatal development of human circadian rhythms.
PG  - 217-26
AB  - The early development of circadian rhythms in primates, including man, was
      reviewed. Continuous 24-h recordings were carried out for maternal and fetal
      circadian rhythms during gestation as well as in preterm infants. Several
      propositions were made based on these new findings: 1. The fetal biological clock
      is an endogenous clock capable of generating circadian rhythms and responding to 
      maternal entraining signals long before the moment of birth. 2. Through the fetal
      biological clock, maternal circadian rhythms influence the fetal overt rhythms.
      3. Maternal rhythms influence the fetus, and fetal rhythms feed back to the
      mother (via the placenta). Disruption of this fetal-maternal interaction during
      gestation leads to: a. disturbances of maternal and fetal circadian rhythms; b.
      disappearance of circadian rhythms at the time of birth; c. a gestational period 
      which is either too short or too long (see also Honnebier and Swaab, 1973); d.
      delayed or impaired maturation of the circadian rhythms of the infant.

      investigated. Seven of 14 lambs born normally at term were thyroidectomized at
      Day 127 of gestation. Colonic temperature and oxygen consumption were measured
      during non-rapid eye movement sleep 6-45 h after birth. All lambs were then
      killed and perirenal brown adipose tissue was sampled for measurement of
      thermogenic activity (guanosine diphosphate binding), uncoupling protein and
      lipid contents. Thyroidectomized lambs tended to have a mean colonic temperature 
      2.35 degrees C lower (P = 0.067) than controls and two became hypothermic (i.e.
      colonic temperature < 35 degrees C). Thyroidectomized lambs exhibited lower rates
      of oxygen consumption (P = 0.05) and an increased incidence of shivering
      thermogenesis. The perirenal adipose tissue of these lambs had a lower
      thermogenic activity (P < 0.01), less uncoupling protein (P < 0.01) and higher
      lipid content (P = 0.072) compared with intact controls. It is concluded that
      fetal thyroidectomy results in a decreased ability of newborn lambs to utilize
      nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue as well as increasing the
      incidence of hypothermia. These changes are associated with decreased synthesis
      of uncoupling protein and functional development of brown adipose tissue in the
      late gestation fetus.

AB  - Genetically based alcohol sensitivity may influence the severity of
      alcohol-related birth defects. To examine this question, measures of growth and
      survival were examined in offspring of the alcohol sensitive Long-Sleep (LS) and 
      alcohol-resistant Short-Sleep (SS) mouse lines following prenatal ethanol
      exposure. Pregnant LS and SS mice received an ethanol dose of either 6 or 8
      g/kg/day from days 7 through 18 of pregnancy. Control groups received a
      maltose-dextran solution made isocaloric to the 8 g/kg/day dose. Ethanol and
      maltose-dextrin solutions were administered as split doses, 6 h apart, via
      gavage. Nonintubated lab chow control groups were also included for both mouse
      lines. Offspring were fostered at birth to lactating mice of an outbred stock.
      Pregnancy was longer for ethanol-treated LS dams compared to maltose-dextrin and 
      lab chow LS control groups, whereas pregnancy length for ethanol-treated SS dams 
      was similar to SS controls. Prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in dose-related
      growth deficits in LS but not in SS litters. Line differences in postnatal growth
      deficits in response to prenatal alcohol exposure suggest maternal or fetal
      alcohol sensitivity influence alcohol-related birth defects.

      sheep.
PG  - 383-9
AB  - Eight time-dated pregnant ewes at 125 days' gestation (145 days = term) underwent
      surgery for placement of fetal vascular catheters, electrodes for recording fetal
      behavioural state, and maternal venous catheters. Three days later, fetal
      cerebral and myocardial blood flow were determined by the coloured microsphere
      technique under four conditions: (1) during rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep,
      before fetal cocaine infusion, (2) 30 min after initiation of a cocaine infusion 
      to the fetus at 0.2 mg/kg per min, (3) during REM sleep, before maternal cocaine 
      infusion, and (4) 30 min after initiation of a cocaine infusion to the ewe at 0.3
      mg/kg per min. Cocaine infusion directly to the fetal lamb did not cause
      hypoxaemia or significantly change cerebral or myocardial blood flow or oxygen
      delivery. Cocaine administered to the ewe led to a drop in fetal oxygen tension
      from 3.0 +/- 0.5 to 2.5 +/- 0.3 kPa (P < 0.0001) and in fetal oxygen content from
      3.8 +/- 0.7 to 2.8 +/- 0.4 mmol O2/L (P < 0.0001). Prior to maternal cocaine
      administration, fetal cerebral blood flow was 146 +/- 103 mL/100 g per min and
      during maternal cocaine infusion it went to 184 +/- 147 mL/100 g per min (P = NS)
      while myocardial blood flow increased from 156 +/- 92 to 333 +/- 178 mL/100 g per
      min (P < 0.002). This increase in blood flow negated the effects of hypoxaemia so
      that cerebral oxygen delivery was unaffected while myocardial oxygen delivery
      increased an average of 67%. It is concluded that cocaine administration to
      pregnant sheep does not impede fetal cerebral or myocardial oxygen delivery.

TI  - Morphology of active sleep--quiet sleep transitions in normal human term fetuses.
PG  - 171-6
AB  - Periods of no coincidence (PsNC) among state variables appear to be more
      predictive of neurobehavioral outcome than the amount of time spent in any
      particular behavioral state. It has recently been suggested that analysis of the 
      ordering of state variables during a state transition may provide results
      equivalent to full state analysis. If this were the case, then there ought to be 
      a relationship between the duration of PsNC and fetal heart rate (FHR)-fetal eye 
      movement (FEM) sequencing at the time of a state change. To test this hypothesis,
      we compared full state analysis with analysis of individual state transitions for
      52 normal human fetuses between 38 and 42 weeks of gestation. For the study
      population as a whole, FHR was the first variable to change in 62 (77%) of 81
      1F-->2F transitions and FEM was the first variable to change in 50 (63%) of 79
      2F-->1F transitions (chi 2 = 67.9, p < 0.001). Ordering of FHR and FEM at the
      time of a state change was reversed in 8 (67%) of 12 fetuses with PsNC > or = 15%
      and is only 6 (15%) of 40 fetuses with PsNC < 15% (chi 2 = 12.5, p < 0.001). We
      conclude that fetuses who exhibit poor state organization more often display a
      FHR-FEM sequence at the time of a state transition which is opposite that of
      fetuses with considerably better state control. However, since only one-third of 
      fetuses with reversed FHR-FEM sequencing actually exhibited more than one such
      episode, it is unlikely that isolated analysis of state transitions will provide 
      a reliable measure of behavioral state organization in the individual fetus.

TI  - [Objective evaluation of physical exertion in pregnant women based on long-term
      recording of heart action. Results of a pilot study].
PG  - 233-9
AB  - The heart rate during whole day, periods of activity and sleep as well as
      repeatable daily activities were identified in a group of 22 women, aged 19-40,
      and pregnant for 12-36 weeks, following a 24-hour recording of the heart work. In
      four women only, mean circadian heart rate was under 87/min, a value considered
      as normal in moderate active persons. That indicates a significant
      pregnancy-related increase of heart rate. A considerable great variation of heart
      rates was observed during a day. The highest heart rate (97-140/min) was caused
      by mounting the stairs; it was also noted during performing minor household jobs 
      and/or preparing meals. While using transportation means, heart rate ranged from 
      78 to 130/min, and at leisure form 89 to 108/min. It was found that the level of 
      an acceptable load for women (100 heart beats/min) was already higher than the
      mean value for the whole period of activity. An analysis of the relationship
      between heart rate in certain situations and the age of women under study, and
      the pregnancy advancement, shows that heart rate was, in each period of
      recording, positively correlated with the women's age. That means an increasing, 
      with age pregnancy-related load. Heart rate during a 24-hour period, periods of
      activity and sleep, during the use of transportation means, watching television
      and resting in a sitting position, was positively correlated with the duration of
      pregnancy. Negative correlation between heart rate and the duration of pregnancy 
      was observed while mounting the stairs, preparing meals and performing other
      household jobs. The negative correlation indicates that the pace of activities
      performed can be easily regulated, and thus, the load magnitude adjusted to
      physical abilities, whereas the positive correlation indicates that such a
      possibility does not exist in regard to the expenditure of energy (work pace). To
      sum up, the data presented shows that the use of transportation means increased
      the women's load but they could easily perform minor household jobs. However,
      there were no occupationally working women in the study group, it can be
      concluded that this kind od analysis, and conclusions drawn, can be used in
      identifying types of work and workplaces which pose too much load to pregnant
      women.

TI  - Physiological variations in thyroid hormones: physiological and
      pathophysiological considerations.
PG  - 135-9
AB  - Thyroid hormone production is regulated via pituitary thyrotropin (TSH)
      modulation of thyroxine (T4) prohormone secretion by the thyroid gland and
      regulation of active triiodothyronine (T3) production in peripheral tissues via
      metabolic events influencing activities of the iodothyronine monodeiodinase
      enzyme systems. Control at both levels is developmentally regulated and modified 
      in serious nonthyroidal illness (trauma, infection, cancer, metabolic diseases). 
      Racial and gender differences are of little significance except for the effects
      of placental estrogens and chorionic gonadotropin during pregnancy. There is a
      circadian rhythm of TSH secretion, with peak values at the onset of sleep and
      nadir concentrations during the afternoon hours. Peak and nadir concentrations
      differ by approximately +/- 50%. The effect on circulating T4 and T3
      concentrations is not significant because of the large size of the extrathyroidal
      T4 pool. In healthy subjects there is no significant impact of body weight,
      physical training, body habitus, posture, immobilization, exercise, or ambulatory
      status on thyroid function, and no significant geographic environmental
      variation. Nutrition also has a minimal impact except for variation in iodine
      intake. Subthreshold concentrations of iodine intake are associated with
      increased TSH secretion, goiter, increased thyroid iodine uptake, decreased T4
      production, an increased T3/T4 secretion ratio, and an increased ratio of
      circulating T3/T4 concentrations. Excessive iodine intake can block thyroid
      hormone biosynthesis by inhibiting the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic
      process, resulting in reduced T4 secretion, increased TSH concentrations, goiter,
      and hypothyroidism if the iodine excess is chronic.

TI  - Maternal anxiety during pregnancy: effect on fetal behavior at 38 to 40 weeks of 
      gestation.
PG  - 391-6
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a relationship between
      fetal behavior and maternal anxiety during pregnancy. The study population
      consisted of 18 uncomplicated human pregnancies at 38 to 40 weeks gestation.
      Maternal anxiety was assessed one time using Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory. After an overnight fast, each mother was given a standard meal on
      arrival to the fetal testing unit. Each fetus was examined for 4 hours using
      heart rate monitoring and real-time sonography. Fetal behavioral states were
      assigned based on heart rate pattern and the presence or absence of eye and gross
      body movements. We found that, compared with fetuses of mothers with low trait
      anxiety scores, fetuses of mothers with relatively high trait anxiety scores
      spent significantly more time in quiet sleep and exhibited less gross body
      movement when in active sleep. The results of this pilot study raise the
      possibility that maternal anxiety during pregnancy may have a significant effect 
      on fetal behavior.

TI  - A consensus view on the technique of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The
      Fourth International Consensus Conference on 24-Hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure
      Monitoring.
PG  - 912-8
AB  - This review, based on the Fourth International Consensus Conference on Ambulatory
      Blood Pressure Monitoring (Leuven, Belgium, 1994), deals with the technical
      aspects of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring by noninvasive intermittent techniques is widely used despite
      artifacts due to cuff size, movement, body position, short-term blood pressure
      variability, and interference with sleep. The performance of the currently
      available monitors under truly ambulatory conditions and during exercise remains 
      a matter of debate, as are the procedures required to validate portable monitors 
      under these circumstances. There is general agreement that whenever a monitor is 
      to be used in special populations, such as older subjects or pregnant women, or
      in special conditions, such as exercise, a specific demonstration of its accuracy
      in these defined subgroups or conditions is warranted. Whether the auscultatory
      or oscillometric method is preferred remains controversial because each technique
      has specific advantages and disadvantages and because both can provide accurate
      results. Most experts in the field strongly believe that manufacturers should
      disclose the algorithms of their devices and that they should specify all changes
      made to the hardware and software of a previously validated monitor. Finally, the
      development of the volume-clamp method, which makes continuous noninvasive
      registration of blood pressure at the finger possible in both stationary and
      ambulatory conditions, opens new perspectives in research, in particular in

TI  - Three-dimensional distribution of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to
      muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the developing human brainstem.
PG  - 350-67
AB  - Acetylcholine has been implicated in brainstem mechanisms of cardiac and
      ventilatory control, arousal, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and cranial nerve
      motor activity. Virtually nothing is known about the developmental profiles of
      cholinergic perikarya, fibers, terminals, and/or receptors in the brainstems of
      human fetuses and infants. This study provides baseline information about the
      quantitative distribution of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in fetal and infant
      brainstems. Brainstem sections were analyzed from 6 fetuses (median age: 21.5
      postconceptional weeks), 4 premature infants (median age: 26 postconceptional
      weeks), and 11 infants (median age: 53 postconceptional weeks). One child and
      three adult brainstems were examined as indices of maturity for comparison. The
      postmortem interval in all cases was less than or equal to 24 hours (median: 10
      hours). Muscarinic receptors were localized by autoradiographic methods with the 
      radiolabeled antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB). Computer-based
      methods permitted quantitation of [3H]QNB binding in specific nuclei and
      three-dimensional reconstructions of binding patterns. By midgestation,
      muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding is already present and regionally
      distributed, with the highest binding levels in the interpeduncular nucleus,
      inferior colliculus, griseum pontis, nucleus of the solitary tract, motor cranial
      nerve nuclei, and reticular formation. During the last half of gestation, [3H]QNB
      binding decreases in most, but not all of the nuclei sampled. The most
      substantial decline occurs in the reticular formation of the medulla and pons, a 
      change that is not fully explained by progressive myelination and lipid
      quenching. Binding levels remain essentially constant in the inferior olive and
      griseum pontis. Around the time of birth or shortly thereafter, the relative
      distribution of binding becomes similar to that in the adult, with the highest
      levels in the interpeduncular nucleus and griseum pontis, although binding levels
      are higher overall in the infant. In the rostral pontine reticular formation,
      paramedian bands of high muscarinic binding are present which do not correspond
      to a cytoarchitectonically defined nucleus. By analogy to animal studies, these
      bands may comprise a major cholinoreceptive region of the human rostral pontine
      reticular formation involved in REM sleep. In the human interpeduncular nucleus
      in all age periods examined, muscarinic binding localizes to the lateral portions
      bilaterally, indicative of a heterogeneous chemoarchitecture. Muscarinic binding 
      is high in the arcuate nucleus, a component of the putative respiratory
      chemosensitive fields along the ventral surface of the infant medulla. This
      observation is consistent with the known effects of muscarinic agents on
      chemosensitivity and ventilatory responses applied to the ventral medullary
      surface in animal models. The nonuniform distribution of muscarinic binding in
      the caudorostral plane in individual brainstem nuclei, as illustrated by
      three-dimensional reconstructions, underscores the need for rigorous sampling at 
      precisely matched levels in quantitative studies. This study provides basic
      information toward understanding the neurochemical basis of brainstem disorders
      involving dysfunction of autonomic and ventilatory control, arousal, and REM
      sleep in preterm and full-term newborns and infants and for developing
      cholinergic drugs for such disorders in the pediatric population.

      labour.
PG  - 891-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the circadian rhythm of circulating levels of
      insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) is evident at the time of 
      delivery. DESIGN: Prospective observational study in six pregnant women and
      cross-sectional study in 65 women at the time of delivery. SUBJECTS: Six pregnant
      women sampled over a period of 24 hours, 23 women sampled at the time of elective
      caesarean section, and 42 women sampled at the time of vaginal delivery. RESULTS:
      In the women sampled serially over a 24 hour period there was an obvious
      circadian rhythm of IGFBP-1 with a peak between 01.00 and 09.00 hours. In the
      women sampled at the time of delivery there was no evidence for any relationship 
      between the time of delivery and maternal or fetal levels of IGFBP-1.
      CONCLUSIONS: The circadian rhythm of IGFBP-1 is not observed in women in labour. 
      Therefore, the time of day is not an important confounding variable in studies on
      IGFBP-1 levels at the time of normal delivery.

TI  - Life-time exposure to dichlorvos affects behaviour of mature rats.
PG  - 721-6
AB  - Wistar rats were exposed to dichlorvos [CAS number 62737]. Doses were 1/25; 1/50;
      and 1/100 LD50, that is 3.88; 1.94; 1.46; and 0.97 mg kg-1 DDVP, respectively,
      throughout gestation (GD1-birth) and during suckling via oral dosing to the dams,
      and then via the same doses by gavage for the rest of their lives. The offspring 
      were tested in an open field (OF), a multiple T-maze, and in a
      'novelty-induced-grooming' test to assess behavioural competence as adults.
      Dose-related increases in running time and incorrect choices in the maze were
      observed during the first 2 weeks of a 3-week study at 9-11 weeks of age.
      Horizontal activity was increased, vertical activity decreased, and defecation
      decreased in the OF at 9-12 weeks of age; these changes were again dose-related. 
      Sleep was also affected at 12 weeks of age. AChE activity in the brain and in
      blood at sacrifice was roughly 40% to 65% of control, again reflecting the doses 
      administered. The significantly changed behavioural profile of DDVP treated rats 
      may serve as a useful biomarker to judge functional damage of CNS properties.

TI  - Family practice residents' maternity leave experiences and benefits.
PG  - 512-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing number of residents are having babies during residency
      training. While many businesses are working to improve maternity conditions and
      benefits for their employees, residency programs are often not prepared to
      accommodate pregnant residents. This study was conducted to examine the maternity
      leave experiences of women who delivered infants during their family practice
      residency training. METHODS: Program directors from each of the 394 family
      practice residency programs listed in the 1993 Directory of Family Practice
      Residency Programs were asked to distribute surveys to female residents who gave 
      birth during their residency training and had returned to work by the time of the
      study. RESULTS: Of 199 known eligible residents, 171 (86%) completed surveys;
      these women represented 127 programs located in 36 states and Puerto Rico. Only
      56.8% of women were aware of their program having a written maternity leave
      policy. The average length of maternity leave was 8 weeks; 76% had leaves of 10
      weeks or less. For many, the maternity leave was derived from more than one
      source, including vacation, sick time, or a mother-child elective. Nearly all
      (88.3%) the women breast-fed, and the mean duration of breast-feeding was more
      than 19 weeks. In general, participants believed that having a baby during
      residency was somewhat difficult. Problems frequently encountered by women after 
      their return to work included sleep deprivation and tiredness, difficulty
      arranging for child care, guilt about child care, and breast-feeding. Factors
      that detracted most from the childbirth experience were too little sleep,
      problems arranging for child care, and lack of support from the partner,
      residency faculty, and other residents. CONCLUSIONS: Having a baby during
      residency is somewhat difficult for the average female resident. Factors that may
      ease this difficulty include getting adequate sleep and receiving support from
      one's partner, faculty, and other residents.

TI  - Twenty four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in women with
      pre-eclampsia.
PG  - 617-21
AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate by means of ambulatory 24 h monitoring the
      diurnal systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure profiles in a group (n 
      = 18) of gravid patients with pre-eclampsia compared with a group (n = 17) of
      healthy control subjects matched for age and week of gestation to assess whether:
      (i) ambulatory BP is also raised in pre-eclampsia; (ii) the increase of BP, if
      present, occurs to the same extent during both daytime and night; and (iii) a
      blunted BP pattern is consistently present in pre-eclampsia. BP was recorded at
      intervals of 15 min for 25 h using a TM2420 non-invasive pressurometer. The
      presence of a circadian rhythm of BP was assessed by cosinor analysis. SBP was
      higher in women with pre-eclampsia (24 h average 115 +/- 11 vs. 136 +/- 12, P = 6
      x 10(-6); daytime 117 +/- 12 vs. 139 +/- 13, P = 6 x 10(-6); night 110 +/- 11 vs.
      129 +/- 14, P = 5 x 10(-5) as well as DBP (24 h average 67 +/- 5 vs. 86 +/- 6, P 
      = 8 x 10(-12); daytime 69 +/- 6 vs. 89 +/- 5, P = 2 x 10(-11); night 62 +/- 4 vs.

TI  - Women at risk for postpartum-onset major depression.
PG  - 639-45
AB  - There is considerable evidence that the childbearing years represent a time when 
      women are highly vulnerable to developing mood disorders. Prospective,
      cross-sectional, and retrospective studies have demonstrated that more than 10%
      of new adult mothers will experience a major depressive episode during the first 
      postpartum year. Changes in the health care delivery system will result in
      increased pressure on the obstetrician/gynecologist to identify and treat women
      with postpartum-onset depression. Despite shortcomings in the available
      literature, prospective studies have identified risk factors for developing
      postpartum depression. Furthermore, the clear overlap between the normal sequelae
      of childbirth and the symptoms of major depression, including alterations in
      sleep, energy, libido, appetite, and body weight, underscores the need to develop
      guidelines for early identification. We furnish a brief overview of postpartum
      mood disorders with a primary focus on the antenatal and postnatal risk factors
      for developing postpartum depression. Based on the extent literature and our
      clinical experience, a set of recommendations for early identification and
      treatment is provided.

TI  - Chronic prenatal cocaine retards maturation of state and of respiratory patterns 
      in swine.
PG  - 567-74
AB  - This study assessed effects of prolonged prenatal cocaine exposure on respiratory
      pattern and sleep-wake states in a postnatal porcine model. Yucatan miniature
      sows received 2 mg/kg cocaine intravenously four times daily during 0.66-1.0
      gestation. At birth, cocaine-exposed litters were fostered to unexposed paired
      sows and their litters. Chronically instrumented piglets were studied at 3-9
      (young) and 21-31 days (older). Sleep-wake states were determined from
      electrocorticogram, eye movements, submental electromyogram, and behavior, and
      respiratory patterns were determined from diaphragmatic and posterior
      cricoarytenoid electromyograms (EMGdi and EMGpca, respectively). Under baseline
      conditions, prenatal cocaine 1) increased the number of apneas expressed by
      silence of EMGdi or EMGpca and prolonged the duration of EMGpca-related apneas at
      both ages; 2) increased the number of periodic breathing episodes at both ages;
      3) increased percent time of active sleep and decreased that of wakefulness at
      both ages; and 4) increased time in quiet sleep in the older animals, producing
      in them a sleep-wake distribution similar to that of the young neonates. Whereas 
      the findings in the youngest piglets may have been influenced by persistent
      systemic cocaine, those in the older preexposed piglets, devoid of systemic
      cocaine, imply that chronic prenatal cocaine retards the postnatal maturation of 
      state and respiratory pattern.

TI  - Normal pregnancy in primary alveolar hypoventilation treated with nocturnal nasal
      intermittent positive pressure ventilation.
PG  - 1424-7
AB  - Nocturnal nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is
      increasingly used to treat chronic respiratory failure in a wide variety of
      conditions (myopathies, Ondine's curse, kyphoscoliosis, etc.) and allows a normal
      everyday life. Some of these diseases affect women of childbearing age. We report
      on a young woman suffering from primary alveolar hypoventilation, who presented
      with limitation of daytime activities, severe oxygen desaturation during sleep,
      polycythaemia and pulmonary hypertension. These abnormalities completely reversed
      after a few months of NIPPV applied through a nasal mask. Whilst under
      ventilatory assistance during sleep, she had an uneventful pregnancy and delivery
      of a normal baby. We suggest that in selected patients requiring NIPPV, pregnancy
      can be contemplated with a reasonable level of safety both for the mother and the
      child, provided that adequate mechanical ventilatory assistance during sleep is
      maintained throughout pregnancy.

OAB - In Kenya, a sexually transmitted disease (STD) program implemented in 10 medical 
      centers in Nairobi allows nurses to diagnose syphilis based on symptoms, have
      blood tests conducted to confirm syphilis, prescribe treatment, and provide
      counseling. About 5% of pregnant women in Kenya have syphilis but do not know
      that they are infected or are afraid to seek sexually transmitted disease
      treatment in health centers. This program tests all pregnant women for syphilis
      during the prenatal examination. Once syphilis is confirmed, the nurse educates
      the pregnant woman about syphilis and tells her that syphilis poses a risk to her
      baby and that she can be treated for syphilis. The nurse must also emphasize the 
      need to treat the pregnant woman's sexual partner. Even though most women agree
      that the partner must be informed, many fear that the partner will react
      violently. Each pregnant woman with syphilis receives several partner
      notification cards asking the partner to go to a health center. The card does not
      mention syphilis. Once at the center, the man is told that his partner has
      syphilis. He is told that syphilis can affect the baby. Usually, the men are
      concerned about the baby. The men receive education on condom use and sexual
      practices because they have more control and initiative in sexual activity
      matters. Even though the men and women are advised to abstain from sexual
      intercourse for a week after treatment, some men have difficulty following this
      advice. The nurse discusses options relevant to both sexes (e.g., condom use with
      all partners). It is difficult for women to propose condom use because these
      decisions are to be made by the men. Women can learn how to use a condom and how 
      to persuade her partner to use the condom. Some women sleep in a separate room or
      return to their family if their partner insists on sexual intercourse. Almost all
      pregnant women involved in the project were successfully treated and their
      partners were informed. More than 50% of the partners were successfully treated. 
      The nurses are pleased with the program.

TI  - Establishment of normal values for flash visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in
      preterm infants: a longitudinal study with special reference to two components of
      the N1 wave.
PG  - 291-9
AB  - To establish normal values for flash visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in the
      preterm period, we analyzed 356 records from 63 neurologically normal infants
      (26-35 weeks gestation) followed longitudinally. Using both sleep and drowsy
      state recording within the same session and a mean of 5.7 weekly recording
      sessions per infant, we hypothesized that the prominent negative wave (N1)
      consisted of 2 negative components, N1a (early) and N1b (late). This hypothesis
      could explain the previously reported variability in VEP indices. With a precise 
      definition of the N1a peak, we were able to establish reference ranges for N1a
      peak latencies at various postmenstrual ages (PMA) which, unlike those previously
      reported, are narrow enough to be clinically useful. From a cross-sectional
      analysis we found that the N1a peak latency decreased with maturation at about
      4.6 msec/week between 30 and 40 weeks PMA (P < 0.001). We also analyzed the N1
      wave form and demonstrated its developmental maturation during this period. There
      were significant decreases in the amplitudes of both the N1a and N1b peaks with
      maturation (P < 0.001), but the decrease of the N1a amplitude was steeper than
      that of N1b. The N1 wave form changed from a wave in which the early peak (N1a)
      was higher than the late peak (N1b) into the reverse with N1b higher than N1a.
      This wave change may be related to developmental processes in the visual system. 
      Longitudinal follow-up revealed that extra-uterine life may accelerate the
      maturation of the N1 wave form but has no effect on the decrease of the absolute 
      values of peak latencies.

PG  - 71-4
AB  - Serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration circadian rhythm is abolished in many
      endocrine and non-endocrine diseases. In the present study we have measured serum
      TSH concentration over 24 h every 2 h in second and third trimester pregnant
      women. During the 24-h period, serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine
      concentrations did not change significantly. In contrast, serum TSH
      concentrations demonstrated significant circadian variations both in the second
      and third trimester pregnant women (p < 0.02 and p < 0.005, respectively). In
      summary, second and third trimester pregnancy is associated with a normal
      circadian TSH rhythm.

OAB - This article discusses the forms of sexual abuse of female children and the
      psychosocial impact on the well-being of girls in India. Child sexual abuse
      statistics reveal an estimated 50% of girls being sexually abused before the age 
      of 15 years. Girl children are abused and then are made to feel personally
      responsible, guilty, or persecuted. Girls are threatened with violence if they
      tell about the sexual abuse. Pregnancies arising from sexual abuse result in
      shame and early marriage. Male children are also abused but they are not made to 
      feel punished. Child sexual abuse is technically any sexual activity (rape,
      fondling of genitalia, masturbation, forced oral sex, sodomy, or vaginal
      penetration) that is committed by someone in a position of authority, power, or
      trust over the child or by a stranger. The World Health Organization estimates
      that 1 in 10 children worldwide is sexually abused. Rape within the family is
      particularly difficult for the victim. In almost 60% of rape cases, the victim
      was unwilling to report the name of the abuser. Families remain silent about
      sexual offenses in order to protect the family image. Mothers remain silent if
      the abuser is the father, which interferes with a child's relationship to both
      parents. Sexual abuse can result in bed wetting, nightmares, sleep disorders,
      depression, anxiety, running away from home, multiple personality disorders,
      precocious sexual behavior, or sexual inhibition and low self-esteem. Parental
      responses tend to be inappropriate discipline or ignoring it. Children may
      experience flashbacks or other long-term effects. Girls who experience sexual
      abuse once tend to be more vulnerable to abuse in adult life. Healing is slow and
      systematic. The first aim is to restore a girl's ability to say no and to teach
      her to protect herself. Healing is about removing guilt and resolution of the
      conflict between blame and the grossness of the violation.

TI  - Diagnosis and selective cure of Cushing's disease during pregnancy by
      transsphenoidal surgery.
PG  - 722-6
AB  - The diagnosis of Cushing's Disease during pregnancy is complex because the
      biochemical features are obscured by changes in the normal
      hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis that occur during gestation. To date,
      treatment has not been successful and there is a high incidence of maternal and
      fetal complications. We report the case of a 24-year-old woman with Cushing's
      disease who presented during her 16th week of pregnancy. Diagnosis was confirmed 
      by the finding of elevated serum and urinary free cortisol levels with loss of
      the normal circadian rhythm of serum cortisol. Cortisol levels failed to suppress
      after a low-dose dexamethasone test but suppressed after a high-dose test. There 
      was an exaggerated serum cortisol and plasma adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) response
      to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH). Magnetic resonance (MR) scanning
      demonstrated a pituitary tumour and cure was effected by transsphenoidal surgery 
      where tumour immunostaining for ACTH was removed. Postoperatively the patient
      made an uncomplicated recovery; serum cortisol and plasma ACTH levels were
      undetectable at 9 days following surgery and recovery of the
      hypothalamo-pituitary axis occurred at 99 days after surgery. Caesarean section
      was performed at 38 weeks of pregnancy and a healthy but small female infant was 
      delivered. This case illustrates the biochemical features of Cushing's disease
      during pregnancy and is the first report of the use of CRH testing and MR
      scanning in this clinical situation. The cure by surgery and successful outcome
      for mother and infant, with preservation of normal anterior pituitary function,
      suggest that transsphenoidal surgery may be the treatment of choice.

TI  - Decreased carbon dioxide sensitivity in infants of substance-abusing mothers.
PG  - 864-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a demonstrable abnormality in control of
      breathing in infants of substance-abusing mothers during the first few days of
      life. METHODS: We enrolled 12 drug-free control infants and 12 infants of
      substance abusing mothers (ISAMs). These infants experienced otherwise
      uncomplicated term pregnancies and deliveries. The infants were assigned to a
      group based on the results of maternal histories and maternal and infant urine
      toxicology screens. Studies were performed during quiet sleep during the first
      few days of life. We measured heart rate, oxygen saturations via a pulse
      oximeter, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ET-CO2) level, respiratory rate, tidal
      volume, and airflow. The chemoreceptor response was assessed by measuring minute 
      ventilation and the ET-CO2 level after 5 minutes of breathing either room air or 
      4% carbon dioxide. RESULTS: The gestational ages by obstetrical dating and
      examination of the infants were not different, although birth weights and birth
      lengths were lower in the group of ISAMs. Other demographic data were not
      different, and there were no differences in the infants' median ages at the time 
      of study or in maternal use of tobacco and alcohol. The two groups had comparable
      baseline (room air) ET-CO2 levels, respiratory rates, tidal volumes, and minute
      ventilation. When compared with the group of ISAMs, the drug-free group had
      markedly increased tidal volume and minute ventilation on exposure to 4% carbon
      dioxide. These increases accounted for the difference in sensitivity to carbon
      dioxide, calculated as the change in minute ventilation per unit change in ET-CO2
      (milliliters per kg/min per mm Hg). The sensitivity to carbon dioxide of control 
      infants was 48.66 +/- 7.14 (mean +/- SE), whereas that of ISAMs was 16.28 +/-
      3.14. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that ISAMs are relatively insensitive to
      challenge by carbon dioxide during the first few days of life. We speculate that 
      this reflects an impairment of the chemoreceptor response.

TI  - Sleep apnoea in babies born after in vitro fertilization.
PG  - 454-7
AB  - UNLABELLED: Babies born after in vitro fertilisation (IVF) are increasing in
      number, and, although these babies are considered as very precious, no data are
      available regarding their risk for sudden infant death or apnoea. To evaluate the
      respiratory maturity of IVF babies, we evaluated the incidence of apnoea during
      an 8-h polysomnography in 50 consecutively presented IVF babies and in a group of
      50 unselected naturally conceived babies. All infants were in good health and
      matched for term (born > 38 weeks of gestation), birth weight, sex and age at the
      time of investigation (6-11 weeks post term, median 8.0). There were 24 twins in 
      the IVF and 6 twins in the control group. The incidence of obstructive and
      isolated central apnoea was comparable in the IVF and control group. However, IVF
      babies had significantly more periodic breathing episodes than control babies
      (median 2.30 (range 0-15.30) in IVF, and 1.02 (range 0-11.2) in control babies; P
      < 0.01). This difference was not related to the higher number of twins in the IVF
      group. Single IVF babies had significantly more short central apnoeas (5-10 s)
      than IVF twins (5-10 s) (mean 38.80 +/- 18.63 and 22.33 +/- 13.35; P < 0.001).
      This difference between single and twin babies was not found in the control
      group. CONCLUSION: IVF babies have more periodic breathing episodes indicating an
      immature respiratory pattern than normally conceived babies.

TI  - Influence of sleep and myometrial activity on systemic and uteroplacental
      hemodynamics in pregnant ewes.
PG  - H1734-9
AB  - Little is known about the influence of sleep on systemic and uteroplacental
      hemodynamics during pregnancy. Experiments were therefore carried out on six
      chronically instrumented pregnant ewes (125-133 days of gestation) to investigate
      the influence of sleep on systemic and uteroplacental hemodynamics. Because
      nonlabor myometrial activity influences uteroplacental hemodynamics, we made
      measurements during quiet wakefulness, quiet sleep, and active sleep in the
      presence and absence of myometrial activity. Cardiac output, heart rate, and
      systemic arterial pressure were decreased in active sleep compared with quiet
      wakefulness; these variables were not significantly altered by myometrial
      activity. The interaction between sleep and myometrial activity was such that the
      lowest values of uteroplacental blood flow, as estimated from middle uterine
      artery blood flow to the pregnant uterine horn and, hence, uteroplacental oxygen 
      delivery occurred during active sleep in the presence of myometrial activity
      (i.e., decreased approximately 19% compared with quiet wakefulness and the
      absence of myometrial activity). Further investigation is required to determine
      the possible fetal consequences of a reduced uteroplacental perfusion in the
      presence of myometrial activity during sleep.

TI  - Fetal behavioral state patterns during and after prolonged exposure to cocaine in
      sheep.
PG  - 1223-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies on the effects of cocaine in fetal animals have been limited
      to acute exposures to the drug. We hypothesized that a prolonged infusion of
      cocaine to the fetal sheep would initially interrupt normal behavioral state
      cycling but the effects would be short lived as the fetus gained tolerance to the
      drug. STUDY DESIGN: The study was performed in a university laboratory on six
      time-dated pregnant ewes at 125 days' gestation. Fetal sheep, surgically
      instrumented 3 days before study, were given cocaine hydrochloride 0.6 mg/min for
      6 hours. Fetal behavioral state before, during, and after the infusion was
      compared by repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Infusion of cocaine 
      caused a drop in the percentage time that the fetuses spent in both
      rapid-eye-movement (p < 0.03) and non-rapid-eye movement (p < 0.001) sleep, which
      was sustained throughout the 6-hour infusion. This was related to a decrease in
      the number of rapid-eye-movement and non-rapid-eye-movement episodes as opposed
      to a decrease in the lengths of these behavioral states. With cessation of
      cocaine infusion, the fetal sheep showed an increase in rapid-eye-movement sleep,
      with a higher percentage than during control periods (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS:
      Cocaine disrupts fetal rapid-eye-movement sleep without evidence for tolerance to
      the drug over a 6-hour period. "Catch-up" rapid-eye-movement sleep occurs with
      cessation of cocaine infusion. Neurobehavioral abnormalities associated with in
      utero cocaine exposure may be caused by chronic disruption of rapid-eye-movement 
      sleep.

TI  - Perinatal outcomes in the pregnancies of asthmatic women: a prospective
      controlled analysis.
PG  - 1170-4
AB  - Prior studies have found an increased incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes of 
      pregnancies in asthmatic mothers, but these studies have been poorly controlled
      for asthma therapy and other confounding factors. The purpose of this study was
      to assess perinatal outcomes in actively managed pregnant asthmatic women as
      compared with matched nonasthmatic controls. Using an inception cohort design, we
      studied a volunteer sample of 486 pregnant (< 28 wk) women with documented asthma
      and 486 pregnant nonasthmatic controls with normal pulmonary function. Cases and 
      controls were matched for age, smoking status, parity, and year of delivery.
      Asthma was managed with step therapy to prevent acute asthmatic episodes and
      asthma symptoms that interfered with sleep or normal activity. Chronic
      hypertension was significantly more common (p = 0.007) in asthmatic subjects
      (3.7%) than in matched controls (1.0%). However, no significant differences in
      incidences of preeclampsia, perinatal mortality, preterm births, low-birth-weight
      infants, intrauterine growth retardation, or congenital malformations were
      observed in the pregnancies of the asthmatic women as compared with the matched
      controls. Trends were observed toward relationships between more severe asthma
      requiring emergency therapy or corticosteroids and increased incidences of
      preeclampsia and low-birth-weight infants, but these associations were not
      statistically significant. These data suggest that the overall perinatal
      prognosis for women with actively managed asthma during pregnancy is comparable
      to that for the nonasthmatic population.

TI  - The effect of passive smoking and tobacco exposure through breast milk on sudden 
      infant death syndrome.
PG  - 795-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between sudden infant death syndrome
      (SIDS) and smoking during pregnancy; postnatal tobacco smoke exposure from the
      mother, father, live-in-adults, and day care providers; and postnatal smoke
      exposure from breast-feeding. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Five counties 
      in Southern California. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 200 white, African-American,
      Hispanic, and Asian parents of infants who died of SIDS between 1989 and 1992
      were compared with 200 control parents who delivered healthy infants. Case
      infants were matched to control infants on the basis of birth hospital, birth
      date, gender, and race. All information was obtained from a detailed telephone
      interview and validated with medical records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of SIDS
      associated with passive smoking by the mother, father, live-in adults, and day
      care providers; smoking in the same room as the infant; total number of
      cigarettes smoked by all adults; and maternal smoking during the time period of
      breast-feeding. RESULTS: Conditional logistic regression resulted in overall
      adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for SIDS associated with passive smoke from the mother
      of 2.28, the father of 3.46, other live-in adults of 2.18, and all sources of
      3.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.81 to 6.75), while simultaneously adjusting for 
      birth weight, sleep position, prenatal care, medical conditions at birth,
      breast-feeding, and maternal smoking during pregnancy. A dose-response effect was
      noted for SIDS associated with increasing numbers of cigarettes, as well as total
      number of smokers. Breast-feeding was protective for SIDS among nonsmokers (OR = 
      0.37) but not smokers (OR = 1.38), when adjusting for potential confounders.
      CONCLUSIONS: Passive smoking in the same room as the infant increases the risk
      for SIDS. Physicians should educate new and prospective parents about the risk of
      tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy and the first year of the infant's life.

TI  - Developmental maturation of gastro-oesophageal reflux in preterm infants.
PG  - 245-50
AB  - The frequency and duration of gastro-oesophageal reflux were examined in 40
      preterm infants and compared with a previously published healthy cohort of 74
      term infants. Selection required that the infants were born between 24 and 32
      weeks' gestation, had a normal head ultrasound and were studied at term
      post-menstrual age. Multi-channel pen recordings of sleep state, movement,
      breathing and acid reflux were made. In term and preterm infants the frequency
      and duration of reflux were greatest in active sleep, rare in quiet sleep and
      significantly less in preterm than term infants in wakefulness and active sleep
      (p < 0.05). The fewer and shorter episodes in preterm infants could not be
      explained by sleep state movement, gestational or postnatal age, days intubated, 
      days on oxygen or the lowest pH of reflux episodes.

TI  - Fetal urine production and micturition and fetal behavioral state.
PG  - 91-2
AB  - The rate of fetal urine production and the incidence of fetal micturition was
      compared in periods of fetal sleep and awakeness. Sonography and fetal heart rate
      monitoring were concomitantly performed on 12 normal term pregnancies. Fetal
      bladder volumes were serially calculated, and the rate of urine production and
      micturition were compared between the periods of fetal sleep and awakeness. Fetal
      micturition occurred almost exclusively during periods of fetal awakeness (p =
      0.001). There were no demonstrable differences in the rates of urine production
      during periods of fetal sleep and awakeness. Fetal micturition is
      behavioral-state dependent. Nevertheless, the fetal behavioral state is not a
      necessary consideration when applying urine production measurements as a test of 
      fetal well-being.

TI  - [Childcare problems and maternal fatigue symptoms in families with twins and
      triplets].
PG  - 187-93
AB  - A mailed questionnaire survey was conducted on a population of 123 mothers of
      twins and 96 mothers of triplets to study problems in the families and maternal
      fatigue symptoms. The following results were obtained. 1) The prevalence rate of 
      handicap was 9.7 per 100 for triplets, and 4.9 per 100 for twins. The risk of
      handicap in triplet pregnancy was approximately 25%, and in twin pregnancy was
      approximately 10%. Therefore 1 in 4 mothers with triplets and 1 in 10 mothers
      with twins had one and more handicapped children. 2) Mothers with triplets aged
      0-11 months reported significantly poorer sleep quality than mothers with
      triplets aged one year or more with shorter sleeping time, greater frequency of
      awakening during the night, and more complaints of inadequate sleep. Mothers with
      twins aged 0-11 months showed a greater tendency for poor sleep quality than
      mothers with twins aged one year or more. 3) Approximately 70% of mothers with
      twins and triplets aged up to two reported lack of time to care for the other
      children. When the age of twin was 3 or more, lack of time to take care of other 
      children was reported by only 13.3% of mothers, while it was 41.7% for mothers
      with triplets. 4) Mothers of twins and triplets who did not receive assistance
      from others for childcare reported severe physical fatigue, compared to mothers
      who received assistance from others. Mothers of twins and triplets aged 3 or more
      showed a tendency of less physical fatigue, compared to mothers of twins and
      triplets aged up to two.

TI  - A longitudinal study of prenatal marijuana use. Effects on sleep and arousal at
      age 3 years.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that sleep disruptions would be evident in
      3-year-old children with a history of prenatal marijuana exposure. DESIGN: A
      prospective study using stratified random sampling beginning in the fourth month 
      of pregnancy. Marijuana and other substance use were assessed by interviews at
      multiple time points. Offspring were followed up through age 3 years with
      multidomain assessments at fixed time points, including electroencephalographic
      sleep studies in the newborn period and at age 3 years. SETTING: Primary care,
      prenatal clinic at a university hospital. SUBJECTS: The sample included 18
      children with prenatal marijuana exposure (mean [+/- SD] age, 39.0 +/- 4.4
      months) and 20 control children (mean [+/- SD] age, 39.7 +/- 4.4 months). The two
      groups were similar in relationship to maternal age, race, income, education, or 
      maternal use of alcohol, nicotine, and other substances in the first trimester.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Sleep variables from polysomnographic recordings at age 3
      years. RESULTS: Children with prenatal marijuana exposure showed more nocturnal
      arousals (mean [+/- SD], 8.2 +/- 5.3 vs 3.2 +/- 4.6; P < .003), more awake time
      after sleep onset (mean [+/- SD], 27.4 +/- 20.0 vs 13.7 +/- 12.4 min; P < .03),
      and lower sleep efficiency (mean [+/- SD], 91.0 +/- 3.8 vs 94.4 +/- 2.1; P < .03)
      than did control children. CONCLUSION: Prenatal marijuana exposure was associated
      with disturbed nocturnal sleep at age 3 years.

TI  - Behavioral state organization in normal human term fetuses: the relationship
      between periods of undefined state and other characteristics of state control.
PG  - 77-81
AB  - Repeated alteration in episodes of quiet sleep and active sleep is a basic
      feature of behavioral state organization in human fetuses. When compared to
      normal fetuses, at-risk fetuses generally exhibit extended periods of no
      coincidence (PsNC), that is, associations between state variables that cannot be 
      classified as a sleep state. The purpose of this study was to determine if
      fetuses with extended PsNC differ in other state measures from fetuses with short
      PsNC. Fetal heart rate and fetal eye and gross body movements were collected
      simultaneously on 85 normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks gestation for a
      total of 9,135 minutes (mean 108.8 +/- 12.7 minutes, range 85-130 minutes). We
      found that as percent PsNC increased, the frequency (r = 0.464, p < 0.0001) of
      state changes increased and the time spent in active sleep (r = -0.456, p <
      0.0001) and the number of fetuses entering an awake state (chi 2 = 4.26, p <
      0.039) decreased. In contrast, percent PsNC was independent of the length of time
      spent in quiet sleep (r = 0.070, p > 0.05). We interpret these findings as an
      indication that extended PsNC may be the result of disruption of homeostatic
      control mechanisms during active sleep.
