## Overview

`sqlr` is an R package that provides a complete and consistent toolkit to process Systematic Quantitative Literature Reviews (SQLR), a method of systematic reviews presented by Catherine Pickering and Jason Byrne in [2014](https://doi.org/10.1080/07294360.2013.841651). The aim of `sqlr` is to facilitate the work of PhD candidates and other early-career researchers with evidence synthesis while also helping with research reproducibility.

Learn more about systematic quantitative literature reviews at http://bit.ly/2OMxvcD .

## Prerequisites

You only need to have some familiarity with the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) to use the `sqlr` main functions.

In case you don't feel comfortable with R, we strongly recommend checking Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund free and online book [R for data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and the Coursera course from John Hopkins University [Data Science: Foundations using R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r) (free for listeners).

## Installation

`sqlr` is still at the [experimental](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental) stage of development, that means that people can use the package and provide feedback, but it comes with no promises for long term stability.

You can install `sqlr` from from GitHub with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("sqlr")
devtools::install_github("gipsousp/sqlr", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Citation

If you use `sqlr` in your research, please consider citing it. We put a lot of work to build and maintain a free and open-source R package. You can find the `sqlr` citation below.

```{r}
citation("sqlr")
```

## Contributing

`sqlr` is a community project, everyone is welcome to contribute. Take a moment to review our [Guidelines for Contributing](https://gipsousp.github.io/sqlr/CONTRIBUTING.html).
