## Overview

`sqlr` is an R package that provides a complete and consistent toolkit to process Systematic Quantitative Literature Reviews (SQLR), a method of systematic reviews presented by Catherine Pickering and Jason Byrne in [2014](https://doi.org/10.1080/07294360.2013.841651). The aim of `sqlr` is to facilitate the work of PhD candidates and other early-career researchers with evidence synthesis while also helping with research reproducibility.

Learn more about Systematic Quantitative Literature Reviews (SQLR) [here](https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-sciences/school-environment-science/research/systematic-quantitative-literature-review).

## Installation

`sqlr` is still at the [experimental](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental) stage of development. That means people can use the package and provide feedback, but it comes with no promises for long term stability.

You can install `sqlr` from GitHub with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gipso/sqlr")
```

## Citation

If you use `sqlr` in your research, please consider citing it. We put a lot of work to build and maintain a free and open-source R package. You can find the `sqlr` citation below.

```{r}
citation("sqlr")
```

## Contributing

`sqlr` is a community project, everyone is welcome to contribute. Take a moment to review our [Guidelines for Contributing](https://gipso.github.io/sqlr/CONTRIBUTING.html).

Please note that `sqlr` is released with a [Contributor Code of

## Support `sqlr`

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/danielvartan)

Working with science in Brazil is a daily challenge. There are few funding opportunities available and their value is not enough to live on. Added to this, every day Brazilian science suffers from deep cuts in funding, which requires researchers to always look for other sources of income.

If this package helps you in any way or you simply want to support the author's work, please consider donating or even creating a membership subscription (if you can!). Your support will help with the author's scientific pursuit and with the package maintenance.

To make a donation click on the [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/danielvartan) button above. Please indicate the `sqlr` package in your donation message.

Thank you!
