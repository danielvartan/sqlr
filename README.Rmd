## Overview

`sqlr` is an R package that provides a system to produce systematic quantitative literature reviews, a systematic review method presented by Catherine Pickering and Jason Byrne in [2014](https://doi.org/10.1080/07294360.2013.841651). Its aim is to facilitate the work of PhD candidates and other early-career researchers with evidence synthesis and to improve reproducibility in research.
